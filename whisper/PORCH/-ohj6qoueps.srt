1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Here lies the old me.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 The kid my parents wanted me to be.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 All the ways the world hurt me.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Goodbye to my fears and anxieties.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 The reason why my ex left me.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Rest in peace to the old me.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 All right, well, hey, welcome everybody in the room.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Everybody tuning in online at all the Ports of Live locations.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 In Houston, North Houston, Des Moines, Boise, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Scottsdale, Arizona, Indianapolis, Greater Lafayette, and all the different live locations.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 We're continuing the series, RIP to the old me.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 What does that mean?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5, 17, in Christ you and I have new life.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And God, when you trusted and put your faith in Jesus, is now producing and bringing about this new life that he has started.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And so we sing rest in peace to old ways and our old life.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And so through this series we've been talking about that.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Let me set the table for what we're going to talk about tonight.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 When I was at Texas A&M and one of my last ever student --

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 [Cheers]

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Shocker, didn't see that coming.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 When I was at A&M at one of my last spring breaks, me and three of my closest friends decided we're going to go on a spring break road trip.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And so we, on the day before we left, got out, got together, the four of us, and we took a coin.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 We flipped it and said if its heads were going east, if its tails were going to go west, and we'll figure it out as we go.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And it landed where its heads, and so we're going to go east.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And here's how we decided where we were going to go.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Each person of the four of us got to choose a city we'd go to.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And so because one person wanted to see Graceland and Elvis, still to this day don't understand exactly why, we went to Memphis.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And we're walking to Memphis, and then we went to Charleston because one of the guys had family in Charleston.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And then another guy was like, even though it's way out of the way, we should go to Florida because I'm dating a girl in Florida.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And we were like, no.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And he was like, yes.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And we were like, all right, Romeo, we're going to Florida.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And then we ended up going to Knoxville in Tennessee and staying with other friends.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And each person in the car was a part of shaping the direction and destination of that car.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Why do I start there?

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Because that car is a metaphor for really your life and my life.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 The people that are closest to you and journeying with you are going to shape the direction and destinations you're going to end up at and be a part of.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And it won't be as clear as just, hey, we're going to Memphis, but it will be as clear as the type of marriage you'll be a part of someday,

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 will be shaped by the girls closest to you if you're a girl, by the guys closest to you.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 The type of character you're building right now is being shaped.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Sadly, a lot of us have been driving in what feels, to use the metaphor, as though we're all alone in that car.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And we're going through life and not experiencing the peace, and we're experiencing disappointment and a loneliness that's leading to all kinds of other problems in our life.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And God, throughout His Word, is emphatically clear. He created and designed us to experience intimate relationships together.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 The added "show me your friends, I'll show you your future" is something that you see all throughout the Bible.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And tonight, we have a chance to hear from a dear friend of our ministry and a woman who is leading a ministry along with her husband

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 that is one of the most influential and impactful I know of, period.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And her name is Jenny Allen. And Jenny is going to join us.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And she just released a book that I could not more highly encourage.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And we're about to talk and all about it. But if you guys help me, welcome to the stage, Jenny Allen.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Hey. Hey, you're back.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 It's good to be back. Hey, awesome.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Okay, like I said, Jenny just released a book, "Find Your People," all about really addressing that idea of loneliness.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Community is what we call it around here, but it's just intimate relationships that God, all throughout the Bible, says are not just --

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 it shouldn't be something that you add on or consider, but prioritize inside of your life.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And as I said before, loneliness really is at an epidemic.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Every month, if not every week, people are emailing in and writing in and just saying, "I feel so disconnected. I feel so alone."

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And the pandemic did not help.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 But really, as you talk about in the book, this is an issue that's been going on long before the pandemic and certainly contributed to it.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And so I want to start by just saying, what are the factors or how did we end up here?

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Well, first I just want to say, hey, PORCH. It's good to be here.

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And I genuinely feel like this is always just coming home.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I know it's my home church, but y'all are my favorites.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Don't tell any of the other ministries.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Being here with you, I love it.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 So it's so good to be here.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And I am so grateful I have my kids here tonight from Texas A&M.

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And a lot of my very closest people tonight were actually -- yeah, I just feel really blessed to be here.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So, yeah, what's the problem?

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I mean, it is a big problem.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I would guess -- I kind of want to ask the question because I like to ask y'all questions.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 But this one's a little more tender to say, do you feel lonely?

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 It's a little more tender.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 It's a harder question to answer.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Interestingly enough, it's actually harder to answer than, do you feel anxious?

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And I think the reason it's harder to answer is because it feels like we look out and nobody else is lonely.

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 But that's not true.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Because the research says three in five people are lonely, and that was prior to the pandemic.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 So my guess would be at this point we're at four in five, if not five in five people feel disconnected.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 We have gotten to a place in our culture where loneliness is almost so normal that you don't even notice that you're feeling it.

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 It is just part of the air that you breathe.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 It is something that you've lived with most of your lives.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And not every generation has.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And so where this project actually came from for me was I was in Uganda, and I was watching two women carrying buckets on their head to go gather their water for the day, and they were cracking up.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 They were glowing, and they were so happy, and you could tell they were getting into trouble together.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And I just remember thinking, I'm jealous.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I'm jealous of two women that have to walk down the water -- or down the path to get water.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Who knows how long.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I'm jealous of them because they are requiring each other to live.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 And every generation and every culture has required connection to survive.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 And we don't.

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 We Amazon every single thing we need.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 We don't even borrow an egg from our neighbor.

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 We are completely isolated from each other.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And so we don't need each other, so we don't go to each other.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Now, we hang out together, and we especially look like we hang out together on Instagram, but we don't need each other.

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And there's a huge difference.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And the reality is we know this.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 The right answer is we do actually need each other.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 But because we don't need each other to survive, and you're so jacked up, and I'm so jacked up, and we hurt each other so much that it just gets to be too much trouble.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And it's like, I don't think -- I think I'd rather just see people in a contained way.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Like I'll go to small group maybe once a month or once or twice.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 No crazy small groups.

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 And then I'll do, you know, I'll do this thing or this thing, but I'm not going to truly live in day in and day out community.

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And honestly, this book was written in such a way that it was written to people that live that way.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 All generations prior to us until the Industrial Revolution lived that way, and 80% of cultures today live in connected villages where they depend on each other day in and day out.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 This bothered me, and it worried me.

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Because I'm thinking if we live in a little dot of history that's doing community and life completely different than it's ever been done.

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And we know the results are -- you and I talk about this all the time -- everybody's anxious, everybody's depressed, everybody's so heavy, then I think we have a huge problem.

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And so it made me curious, and it made me worried.

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And so I thought, okay, let me just go start looking and start seeing how are we supposed to live.

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And the sad part was, David, is I felt like when I did the research, it was so broken that it felt like I don't even know how we change it just because we're so isolated.

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And I mean, I'm curious for you guys because you're all sitting here together, and I'm picturing you walking in with tons of friends.

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 But I'm going to go ahead and ask the brave question.

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Like how many of you this week have felt lonely at some point?

115
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Okay, good.

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 I wasn't wrong.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 All right.

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 [Laughter]

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Everybody raise their hand for the people through the camera.

120
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Just one guy in the front row.

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 So one of the things that I really love in the book -- so I've been in community for eight years with four other couples, and we harpen in a ton here.

122
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 One thing that I really appreciate that I want to spend a decent amount of our conversation on is pushing through some of the barriers to opening up, to being real, to being authentic and all that stuff,

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 and to taking, wherever you're at on the spectrum, more ground in deepening those relationships.

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 But before we go there, you talk about the term "deep community," and how would you define that?

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And that's pretty broad and open-ended, but is there a way that you would say, "Hey, here's kind of the future destination to begin pursuing"?

126
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Okay, let's just start at the beginning.

127
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Genesis, man is on the planet, and God says, "It is not good for you to be."

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 So I mean, what we're going to talk about today, like my view on this, I'm going to go ahead and say it up front.

129
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 It's very radical compared to most people what they would say and how you're living.

130
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 But I would say deep community is in your day in and your day out life, that every single thing about you is known, that you are not living in any secret, any secret.

131
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And I'm not just talking about sin.

132
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 I'm talking about that anxious thought that has been bugging you all day, that every single thing about you is known by someone.

133
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Now, you can't be known by a ton of people, but you could be known by two to five people, and we'll talk about the research in a minute.

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 But two to five people is about how many people you could be in day in and day out life with.

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 I'm talking about running errands together.

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 It is not good for man to be alone.

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I'm talking about eating together.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And I mean, I'm really sensitive to the fact that I have shown up talking about this to mostly singles.

139
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Amen.

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And I'm excited about it because I think actually, I'm going to tell you this too.

141
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 I think you have the power to change this problem in our culture better than anybody else because you've got a little flexibility.

142
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And I think this brokenness that we have right now of, can I get off topic for just a minute and come back?

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Okay.

144
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Actually, I've changed my mind.

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Let's not.

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And I'm totally kidding.

147
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Go.

148
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 In the 1920s, there was a philosopher guy that really was a marketer who wanted to sell toasters.

149
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And he decided to create something called the nuclear family.

150
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 It was two adults, two and a half kids.

151
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 That was now the nuclear family.

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Prior to that, families were aunties, uncles.

153
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Have you seen In the Heights, that movie?

154
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Abuelas, okay?

155
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Abuelas.

156
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Abuelas that parented the whole street, right?

157
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 It didn't matter if you were their kid or not.

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 You got food even though we don't have barely anything.

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 You show up at my door, you're my kid.

160
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Call me auntie.

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 That's how most of the world functioned.

162
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Family was the people around you that you loved.

163
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 You lived in a village of say tops 150, usually about 100.

164
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And any time you reached over 20, bear with me, any time you reached over 25 kids, you'd

165
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 start a new school that would create a new village.

166
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 By nature of the size of a village, it would break off and start a new village.

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 You wouldn't leave the village all your life.

168
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 You'd grow up with all your grandparents and parents and siblings all of the days of your

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 life.

170
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And all the people that you lived with, they'd all be there too.

171
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And you'd barely leave 20 miles from your house all your days.

172
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 That's all of history, okay?

173
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And families took care of each other and families were friends and families were singles.

174
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And they were adopted into families.

175
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 You would have an abuela, you would have aunties, you would be an auntie, you would be an uncle.

176
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 That's how it always was until America, somebody decided they wanted to sell more toasters.

177
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 So they decided to go two adults, two and a half kids.

178
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 That's a family.

179
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Build a fence, get an alarm system, sell a toaster.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 You need your own because you're not gonna borrow your aunties next door because that's

181
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 too far to walk and you gotta go over the fence and it's just trouble.

182
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 So get your own toaster and they sold toasters.

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 And the whole idea worked.

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And this is why I think y'all could change the whole wide world.

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Because you could be an auntie.

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Like you could love people's kids, you could go into people's homes, you could say I want

187
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 you to adopt me.

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Like my parents live in, I almost said Africa.

189
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Sure, maybe.

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 I mean, it's probably not very many of you, but yeah.

191
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 So Africa.

192
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And you need an abuela.

193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 You need somebody.

194
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Everybody knows what the word abuela means, right?

195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 It's grandmother.

196
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Okay, just making sure.

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 So you need that.

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 We need this.

199
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 This is a sadness for you, especially in this room.

200
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 If anybody should be ticked off that this is the way the world went, it should be singles.

201
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Because we are not, no, God said it is not good for anyone to be alone.

202
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 So something's broken.

203
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 You're supposed to be a part of a unit.

204
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 You're supposed to take care of your neighbors.

205
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 You're supposed to take them a casserole.

206
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I don't know if you've learned that yet, but we're in the South.

207
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 If we don't know that, nobody knows that.

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 We got to get that right.

209
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Like you need to know how to make something with cream of mushroom and rice.

210
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Like that needs to be top of mind.

211
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Boys too, come on.

212
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Ritz crackers with some butter on top.

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Like that's how it goes.

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 That is how it goes.

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And when somebody's mother goes in the hospital, you know what?

216
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 You don't know their mother, but you know them, and you take them a?

217
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Casserole.

218
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Teaching y'all something tonight.

219
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 So what I know is because we're carrying the whole wide world's problems, right?

220
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 How many problems did you read about today?

221
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 We don't take anybody a casserole because we're so tired.

222
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Because we heard the problems of the whole wide world.

223
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I'm worried about Ukraine.

224
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It's hard to care about my neighbor.

225
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 So I can't remember your question exactly.

226
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 But --

227
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Toaster's answered it.

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Yeah, it was good.

229
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 No, it is so true.

230
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And Uber Eats and all the different things is only -- it both comes with a blessing and a curse.

231
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 The question was around deep community.

232
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Like how would you define that?

233
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Because to your point, you started with this generation can change that.

234
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 One of the ways they can change that is by being involved and being connected to local churches and other families.

235
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 They may not be biological families.

236
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 But there are also some things that we can pursue.

237
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 A hundred years ago, they may have lived in a village with a hundred people, but they may not -- they still were not known.

238
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And a lot of that's really practically written in scripture and captured in this book.

239
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 So I don't know if there is a definition you'd say is here's what I mean by deep community.

240
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Well, I wanted to start with a problem because I think if we understand what's broken --

241
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Yeah.

242
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 -- then we can start to imagine what could be.

243
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And if we can imagine how it was and why I like to start with the problem and the cultural shift that we're a part of is because it really kind of comes down to Ritz crackers and butter.

244
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Like it actually comes down to doing life together in such a deep way that we don't miss each other, that we actually see each other,

245
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 that we don't feel alone in the midst of a room like this because, you know, for me, I've got about 12 people down here that I'm related to or is one of my dearest friends that they --

246
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 for the most part in the last two days, I've talked to all of them.

247
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Like they're in my life.

248
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 We're going to go out to eat after this.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Like we're doing life together.

250
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 And so I think it starts by being known.

251
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And I want to actually pull up -- I will answer that question.

252
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 I want to pull up the circles that describe these different things.

253
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 So we know that -- I mean, you're Christians, a lot of you, and you know God's supposed to be in the center, right?

254
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 I could give that speech, but I'm going to not give it right now.

255
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And that does matter a lot because if we go into relationships and try to get all of our needs met from each other, that's going to always go poorly.

256
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 That's called codependency.

257
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 You're putting your dependence on someone else, and that can lead to all kinds of brokenness.

258
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 So the reason God has to be in the center is if I go to those people that are in my life regularly and say, "Meet a need for me.

259
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Meet a need for me.

260
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Meet a need for me," it probably is never going to happen.

261
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 However, if I go and say, "I love you.

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 I'm here for you.

263
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Today I need you to be here for me," that's okay.

264
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 We can be needy.

265
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It's just that if we expect people to be God, it breaks down.

266
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 But outside of that, we've got an inner circle, and then we've got acquaintances.

267
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 That white circle in the middle is actually the village.

268
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 It's actually the place where I would say about 50 people that you know by name that you actually can think of, "You know what?

269
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 If something happened to them, I would want to help them."

270
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And the reason I want to set this up first before I get to your answer is we've got to understand what categories people fall in

271
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 because if we're trying to take someone in our village that's in our 50s, say, and we try to put stuff in them into our inner circle,

272
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 it's going to feel awkward if we haven't seen them in three weeks and we're trying to confess our sin to them the first time we see them.

273
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And so what I'm saying is that inner circle of two to five people, that circle is scientifically what capacity we have.

274
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 The 150, the acquaintances, that's typically what the size of a village would be,

275
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 and in the middle, the 50 would be the people that you'd actually be taking care of.

276
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 My brother-in-law said when I told him I was going to do all this work on villages,

277
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 he lives in a place that's kind of like a village off the radar, and he said, to your point,

278
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 he said, "Well, yeah, that's great, unless you wake up and you're in a village of cannibals."

279
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And I was like, "Yeah, that's pretty bad."

280
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 But what he means is people hurt you, and no village is perfect,

281
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 and our goal is not just to gather people around us or to live like people used to, right?

282
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 The goal is to live as Christ called us to live, but because culturally we have under our feet something that's so broken,

283
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 we've got to start with we need some practical pieces there that we haven't had.

284
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 So if it's not good for man to be alone, then we shouldn't be eating alone, then we shouldn't be living alone,

285
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 we shouldn't be spending all of this time alone, we should be bringing people in to our everyday lives.

286
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And I'm not saying it's wrong to live alone, I'm just saying you better know why you're living alone.

287
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And again, I'm going to say some radical things tonight, but I would really question why are you living alone?

288
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Because there's a lot of people that are lonely, and it's easier to do life together if you're doing it in proximity with each other.

289
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 But to your question, biblically, how do we do this?

290
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Let me start with this, Hebrews 10 verse 24,

291
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 "And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some,

292
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the day drawing near."

293
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And then there's another passage where it says, "We're going to encourage each other as long as it is called today,

294
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 so that we are not hardened by sin's deceitfulness."

295
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 So there's a real result in not being together and encouraging each other.

296
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 So there's a sense that we don't want to be hardened.

297
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Do you know, have you ever been across from someone and they feel hardened to you?

298
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 You may not use that word, but if you thought about it, you probably would.

299
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 But they just feel cold, and they feel disconnected, and they feel distracted, and they feel like they're not tender.

300
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 They're listening to you, and they're not empathetic.

301
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Anybody?

302
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I mean, I'm sure we've all been that person too, but I think we notice it more in someone else, right?

303
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 So when that happens, that hardness, you're not connected.

304
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 So there's a chicken and an egg here in these verses that say,

305
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 "You've got to gather together, and you've got to encourage each other as long as it is called today."

306
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Stir up courage.

307
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 You've got to stir up courage so that you don't get hard, so that you don't get hardened by sin.

308
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 So there's a sense that as we're going alone, we're getting hardened in our sin.

309
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Our hearts are getting hard.

310
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Well, guess who wants to be alone?

311
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Hard people.

312
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 You want to be alone.

313
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 It's why you want to watch Netflix, because it's hard to be tender.

314
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 It's hard to actually share your guts out.

315
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 It's really hard to even right now--I would say this, and I don't know, that y'all are probably--you're way cuter and younger,

316
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 but it's probably easier for you, but for me, it's hard for me to pick going out over Netflix in my robe.

317
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 That's not y'all.

318
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Y'all are like out on the town.

319
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Y'all are keeping everybody in business.

320
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Okay, good.

321
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Okay, so check.

322
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 You're out.

323
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 All right, so then once you're out, what, David, you're asking me about is vulnerability.

324
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 How do you get there?

325
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 So the next thing is you have to say things that actually help you be known,

326
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 because if it is not good for a man to be alone, then it is not good for us to be alone in anything,

327
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 in any secret, in anything that we're going through.

328
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 It's not good.

329
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I'm not saying it's never good to be alone.

330
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Obviously, Jesus was alone, and David recommends we do the same thing,

331
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 so I'm not saying there's not times that we be alone,

332
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 but in general, there's a sense that our hearts get hard the longer we're alone.

333
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Some of you know this because you have a granddad that is alone, and he's cranky,

334
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 and that's what happens.

335
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Like we really do.

336
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 We trend towards being cranky.

337
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And so the verse says, "Encourage each other as long as called a day."

338
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Stir up courage.

339
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 How do you stir up courage?

340
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I need to know what you're afraid of.

341
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 If I'm going to stir up courage for you, I have to know what you're afraid of.

342
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I think we should show them that Mad Libs thing.

343
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Oh, for sure.

344
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Because I think this is a good point to talk about vulnerability.

345
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Yeah.

346
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Yeah.

347
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Alex, stir it up.

348
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Yeah.

349
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 So I told her, as we were talking before this,

350
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 I think one of the challenges is putting language around being transparent and open

351
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and authentic.

352
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And I think at Watermark, we do a really good job of providing practical tools

353
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 on being open about your dating relationship, purity, your finances,

354
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 all of those things.

355
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And an area that I can struggle with is articulating the feelings that I have.

356
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And I told her this was helpful for me to read.

357
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 So you want to expand on it?

358
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Yeah.

359
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 So I wrote this because I'm really bad at sharing my heart.

360
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I'm really bad at doing -- like if what happens,

361
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 my friends over there are going to be like, "Yeah, in fact, you can just say amen

362
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 because they all know."

363
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I'm not good at telling you how I feel.

364
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Like when I sit down and we're going out, they're good.

365
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Like one of my friends over here, Lindsay, she cries.

366
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 She'll call me in the middle of her cry.

367
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 She'll be bawling and she'll call me and she'll be like, "Hee-zah, hee-zah, ha."

368
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And I'm like, "Okay, I need to go over there.

369
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 What's happening?"

370
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 I don't do that.

371
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 I cry really hard by myself in my closet.

372
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Then I get up and I think about it for a long time.

373
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And maybe by tomorrow I'll tell you I cried really hard in my closet yesterday.

374
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 No, I'd probably leave that in the closet because that's weird.

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 But I'd say I cried really hard yesterday.

376
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 But I'm not good at just off the cuff being like, "You know what I feel?"

377
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 So I awkwardly did it to David back there, almost just because I knew we were going to talk about it.

378
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 David was like, "How are you doing, Jenny?"

379
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And I was like, "Honestly, I'm not very good."

380
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 He was like, "Okay."

381
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Thanks for being here.

382
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 I was like, "Yeah."

383
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 We had a bury at my cousin yesterday prematurely.

384
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 We, you know, named a couple things.

385
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And I was like, "I just feel kind of braced.

386
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Like I don't know what's going on."

387
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 He was like, "Okay."

388
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 But I did it somewhat unintentionally because I'm learning to awkwardly do it.

389
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 I'm going to tell you right now.

390
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I think David genuinely wanted to know how I was.

391
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Did you?

392
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Yes.

393
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Okay.

394
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Of course, of course, of course, of course.

395
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 I got this since he kind of cared.

396
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Of course.

397
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 But I also have learned it's okay to be a little awkward.

398
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And I will risk being awkward.

399
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 I will risk being awkward with the chance I could feel connection

400
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 than be fake and disconnected.

401
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Wow.

402
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 That's good.

403
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And I think nothing we talk about tonight, nothing I wrote about,

404
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 nothing is not awkward.

405
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 It's all awkward.

406
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 So I wrote this because I'm awkward.

407
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And I'm not good at sitting down with my friends and telling them how I am.

408
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 And so what they have to do, and they do often for me,

409
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 is they basically say, "Bull crap," and that you're not telling the truth.

410
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 They'll be watching me.

411
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 They're like, "I'm good.

412
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Everything's good.

413
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 My kids are okay.

414
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 So and so has got a little problem."

415
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Bull.

416
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 You're not telling the truth.

417
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 I can tell, Jenny.

418
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 You look not good.

419
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 What's wrong?

420
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Thank you.

421
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 But it's true.

422
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Something's often wrong and something that I don't want to talk about.

423
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And so I wrote this for myself.

424
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 We'll put it back up.

425
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 And I wrote it because I thought, "I almost am like a kindergartner.

426
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 I just need to fill in the blanks."

427
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 So this is what I wrote.

428
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 This week at work or at home, I was busy with blank, and I felt blank.

429
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 I think I felt that way.

430
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 I literally wrote this for myself, y'all.

431
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 I'm not kidding.

432
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 This was a fill in the blanks so I would be more vulnerable.

433
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 I think I felt that way because blank.

434
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 I wish that blank would happen.

435
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Very few people know that blank is happening in my blank.

436
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Who knows?

437
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 I need blank, but I'm afraid to ask for it.

438
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I'm hesitant to open up because, and this is where I want to stop.

439
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 We're going to all answer that.

440
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 And the greatest way you could love me right now is to blank.

441
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 And those are the things, the simple little things.

442
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 That's just, we could probably all fill that out pretty fast.

443
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 But why is it so hard to say that to other people?

444
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Why are those parts of our lives, our fears, our thoughts, our struggles,

445
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 like why are they so hard or awkward to say to each other?

446
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And yet that's where courage can come in.

447
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 That is what we're supposed to do together.

448
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 If we're fighting something as ugly as the hardening of our hearts because of sin.

449
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 It's a really cute verse.

450
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Like you've probably seen it with flowers somewhere.

451
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Encourage each other as long as it's called a day so that we're not hardened by sin's deceitfulness.

452
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 But, y'all, we're fighting the deceitfulness of sin.

453
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 The deceitfulness of sin.

454
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 That's what we're fighting by encouraging each other.

455
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And so those little things that we don't share with each other, that means we can't fight for each other.

456
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 At the end of the day, you know, one of my fears in this book was,

457
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 I'm writing a book about friendship, and I'm like a really urgent person.

458
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Like if I could go to war, I'd go.

459
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Except I wouldn't because I don't like blood or dying or getting shot or anything else.

460
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 But I just mean for it like to matter.

461
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Like just because, you know, like just it matters.

462
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 It's important.

463
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 I want to do things that are important.

464
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And so I'm writing a book about friendship.

465
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And I was like, I just -- but I never felt that way about it because to me it was war.

466
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 It was we're all so discouraged.

467
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 We're all so tired.

468
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 We're all so beat down.

469
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Everybody's anxious.

470
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Everybody's stuck.

471
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And we're all alone.

472
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And what if we weren't alone and that changed all the rest of the things?

473
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 So the question, and we talked about backstage, the real question was,

474
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 why am I hesitant to open up, which was one of the fill in the blanks.

475
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 And I think there's lots of reasons.

476
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 But you said one.

477
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Yeah, I mean, I think one thing you addressed and we've talked about here is one reason we feel alone is because we're not known.

478
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 And you can't be loved if you're not known.

479
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Because if I don't know the real you, then I can't actually love the real you.

480
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I can love a fake version of you, and you'll know in your head, oh, he loves --

481
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 he says he loves me, but he really loves a version -- he doesn't even really know me.

482
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 So that contributes to our loneliness, and there's barriers that make us unwilling to open up.

483
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And I said I think one of the barriers that I can feel is not even a fear of being known or being authentic, but being a burden.

484
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And I think often we can feel like, man, if we just all sit around and say everything that we're all carrying and put it on everybody,

485
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 we're going to be here for 75 days, number one.

486
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 And number two, like, they've got enough -- you're carrying enough walking in here with all that your family and life.

487
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And so what would you say to somebody who is reluctant because they just don't want to make their problems somebody else's problems?

488
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 So you've got to know who to share your problems with.

489
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Please don't share them with everybody.

490
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 David, I awkwardly put in that position because we were about to talk about this.

491
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And I might have told you on another day, too.

492
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 I just think you like me more than maybe you do.

493
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 I do. I was kidding. I love you.

494
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And of course I asked that in love.

495
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 So you've got to know.

496
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 You can't do that with everybody.

497
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Guys, you know what?

498
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 That's called a really cranky person.

499
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 So don't do that.

500
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 You've got to have your people.

501
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 The difference in complaining and transparency and vulnerability is complaining seeks relief.

502
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Transparency seeks healing and connection.

503
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 When you're seeking vulnerability, to be vulnerable with someone else, you're seeking to be known by them, probably to know back from them something.

504
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 You're seeking healing.

505
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 You're seeking maybe help or you're seeking even help by just sharing it.

506
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 You actually have pathways.

507
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Why therapy lots of times works is you have pathways that open up when somebody empathetically listens to you.

508
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 So when somebody listens to you, like courage can come, that verse, can come by sitting across from coffee with someone else

509
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 and having them mirror feelings that you're feeling back to you.

510
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Not even saying anything.

511
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Just empathetically listening to you.

512
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 It's a lost art.

513
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 We don't do this very well.

514
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 But there's something in your brain that actually heals.

515
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Your wife's a counselor.

516
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 When you do that, it's why a lot of people pay for it because we're not very good at this.

517
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 It's sad that we have to, and I'm certain there's times that you should.

518
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 But what if we all became better counselors for each other?

519
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 As Kurt Thompson says, we come into the world looking for someone looking for us.

520
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 And we never stop for the rest of our lives.

521
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 We come in as babies.

522
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 The baby comes out.

523
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 It's in the world looking for someone looking for them.

524
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And so when you're sitting across from someone next time, I want you to think about that person as looking for you to look for them

525
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 and we go at that wanting to get things because we're all so starving for this.

526
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 We're starving for connection.

527
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 The three main things that we're looking for is to be seen, soothed, and safe again from birth.

528
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 But we always are.

529
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Never stops.

530
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Seen, soothed, safe.

531
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 That is actually the best premarital counseling anyone could ever give you guys, specifically the dudes.

532
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Make your wife feel seen, comforted, and safe.

533
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Done.

534
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Anything you want forever.

535
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Like those women are happy.

536
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Because it's our deepest longing.

537
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 It's what we want.

538
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 It's what we're craving.

539
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 So when we find that in any kind of relationship, there's a sense of I could share the thing that I don't want to share.

540
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 But it's still hard, and I would say it's always hard.

541
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 It's still hard for me.

542
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Like I was so bad at this that, yeah, I was really bad at this, and I've had to practice getting good at this.

543
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And it's been practice.

544
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 I don't know that there's another word for it.

545
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 I'm not -- mine isn't what you said, a little bit of what you said.

546
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 I don't want to take the oxygen out of the room.

547
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I don't want to be a burden to people.

548
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 I'd rather be there for them.

549
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 But it was deeper than that.

550
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 I think I didn't even want to know myself what was hard.

551
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Like I don't even think I wanted to admit to myself.

552
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And so what ends up happening is that's a hardening in itself too, and you cut yourself off.

553
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And you cut yourself off from needing God.

554
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 You cut yourself off from needing people.

555
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 When I talked about villages earlier, I think about us and what they did for survival and what 80% of the world today does for survival.

556
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 We could view that in an emotional sense right now.

557
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 If everybody's lonely and everybody's disconnected and everybody's anxious and everybody needs that courage to be built up in them,

558
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 I think we could just on a purely emotional level say this is so desperate that we're going to get into each other's lives in a really profound way.

559
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 That's good.

560
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 There's five ingredients, and I wish we had more time to just go through all of this.

561
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 There's a couple other questions I want to ask too.

562
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 There are five ingredients of deep friendships that you described that I thought put language around those things in a really helpful way.

563
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Could you give us those five in really a sentence?

564
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 You've named a couple of them already.

565
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 So proximity, you've got to do life together.

566
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 Your friends out of town, you've got to have somebody that can look you in the eyes and say, "Hey, I don't think you're doing well.

567
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 How can I help you?"

568
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 The next one is vulnerability.

569
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 You've got to be transparent with each other.

570
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 They've got to know.

571
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 And a lot of this I took from looking at villages that proximity was the fires that people used to build in their villages,

572
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 and they'd all come together after the kids were in bed.

573
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 They'd cook together.

574
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 They'd do life together.

575
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 In villages, if you go, there's no doors, and so vulnerability is this idea of open doors,

576
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 and you live an open life with people that you're close to.

577
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 The next one is accountability, and that's the surprising one.

578
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Not at this church.

579
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 We're really good at that.

580
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 But most cultures aren't right now, yet throughout history they have been good at it.

581
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 And you've seen, you know, there's tribal elders that, you know, when I took my son back to Rwanda,

582
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 they grabbed him by the collar, and they were all parenting him, like everyone.

583
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 People we didn't even know.

584
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 People on the streets were parenting my Rwandan son because that's what they do.

585
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 They parent each other's kids.

586
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 They help each other, hold each other accountable.

587
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 And then the next one is a shared mission, to do something beside each other, to do something arm in arm.

588
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 It's very bonding.

589
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 It helps you not feel alone.

590
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Now, that could be at your workplace.

591
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 That could be volunteering in children's ministry, which I highly recommend all of you should do.

592
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 It could be serving somewhere, but it also could just be plain pickleball.

593
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Like, and I don't -- my mom does it with Bridge.

594
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 She's in a Bridge club, and she is on mission there with her friends.

595
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 But they have a thing that they're doing together.

596
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 And then the last one is consistency, that you don't leave when it gets hard.

597
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 And I think that probably might be the hardest part, is we do tend to leave when it gets hard.

598
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 And I think that's, you know, if I look at problems today, that's another one just --

599
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 friendships are disposable.

600
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 If somebody hurts you, you walk away.

601
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 But the reality is we were meant to work through conflict, and conflict was actually supposed to help us get closer to each other.

602
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 And so a good fight is actually defining of a good friendship.

603
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 You can go through conflict together instead of bail and walk away.

604
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 And so staying and being consistent and then clocking hours together, it takes about 200 hours for an acquaintance to become a good friend, an inner circle friend.

605
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 So that just -- for you to just quit someone that has made it to your inner circle,

606
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 that means you're going to have to start over and spend at least 200 hours developing a new friendship.

607
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 So those are the five.

608
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 So in this stage, I think you would say -- because when you're coming into young adulthood,

609
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 you form these incredibly deep friendships in college, and then you leave and you move to a new city,

610
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 and you're having to recreate, and you're feeling like,

611
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 "I'm never going to be as close to this community group as I was to my college roommate," you know,

612
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 some of which were believers, and you had those deep connections.

613
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 And I think you would say you've got to fight for those types of relationships.

614
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 They may have come more naturally when you shared a dorm room or shared a house with six of you living.

615
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 But today, because you're not in that environment, you can still have friends that live somewhere else,

616
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 but you've got to fight today.

617
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 So to the person who's saying, "Man, I feel like I'm fighting, but it's not reciprocated,"

618
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 or, "I feel like I'm always the one initiating," what would you say?

619
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 I'd say my dream and my prayer for this project has been that tens of thousands of initiators are sent into the world

620
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 because the initiators are the people that can change everything.

621
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 And if you want friends, which some of you are introverts, and you're like,

622
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 "I wish I didn't even show up tonight."

623
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 Listen, you are actually better at this than you think.

624
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 You're actually really good at that inner circle.

625
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 You're actually good at that deeper connection.

626
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 And God says it's not good for you to be alone either.

627
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 So it's not that you don't need to be alone.

628
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 It's that you don't need to be alone all the time.

629
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 And so you're pursuing this with the margin that you have for people as much as you can.

630
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 But I would just say that initiating can change everything.

631
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 I've heard stories recently because some of the people got the book early,

632
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 and the stories they've said are things like this.

633
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 I was sitting next to these few women every single week.

634
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 We were watching our kids do gymnastics, and we would just scroll our phones.

635
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 And she said, "But because I was reading this book,

636
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 I just talked to the person next to me for 30 minutes while we were sitting there anyway,

637
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 and we completely bonded.

638
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 She completely opened up to me, and we have game night on the calendar next week with our husbands."

639
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 Like this is how the world changes.

640
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 You just notice who's right in front of you.

641
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 That village is supposed to be the people that you don't think much about,

642
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 but they're probably in and out of your life on a daily basis anyway.

643
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 They're probably coming to mind right now, and you text them and say,

644
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 "Hey, I really want to set a more regular time to see you

645
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 because sometimes I go a week without seeing the same people week in and week out,

646
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 and that makes me sad.

647
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 And I just want to know that every week I'm going to see you,

648
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 and we're going to hang out together."

649
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 Whatever the small change is, a girl today stopped me outside and said,

650
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 "I bought a fire pit because of your book,

651
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 and I bought a fire pit in my backyard,

652
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 and my husband and I just started inviting people over

653
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 because a fire's a great thing.

654
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 You could just sit there and look at it.

655
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Like it's so fun to look at fire.

656
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Love it.

657
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Love looking at fire."

658
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 And then you don't have to cook for them, like tops, you know, s'mores.

659
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Like keep them in your pantry.

660
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 That's what we do.

661
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 And so you don't have to make this hard.

662
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 You know, this can be little changes that you walk out and make,

663
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 but it will require what you're saying, which is initiation.

664
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 If you don't initiate, you will not have friends.

665
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 That's good.

666
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 I want to give you a chance to say anything else you'd leave them with.

667
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 I'd love to put that chart up one more time because I think that in a society,

668
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 as a culture, we're so feelings-driven often,

669
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 and we're also ironically feelings illiterate,

670
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 in that we don't often take the time to be introspective

671
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 and actually navigate and not just listen to my feelings,

672
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 but to listen to them in a way of, "Hey, what is this actually telling me?"

673
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 and to be a good enough friend that sits there with you.

674
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 And I think one thing that I was challenged, not that one, the--

675
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 what did you call it?

676
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 I called it mad libs, emotional mad libs.

677
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 Mad libs.

678
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 That I think you would say, "Hey, if you feel this out,

679
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 "or if someone shares something like this with you,

680
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 "there's a balance between immediately correcting them

681
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 "and telling them not to feel that way,

682
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 "and also just giving them the space and creating that environment

683
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 "and saying, 'Man, that must be really hard.'"

684
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 And that's not always something I'm great at.

685
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 In fact, I think as a culture,

686
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 we could probably grow in the church of doing that better.

687
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 But what's the balance between somebody shares this,

688
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 and then you're speaking into it,

689
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 and also just trying to foster an environment where they can share that?

690
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 And you guys--it may be wise, honestly, take a picture of this right now

691
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 and share with your community and talk with your community about the things.

692
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 This may be the most profound thing, honestly, you walk out of here with.

693
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 It at least was profoundly helpful in terms of language for me.

694
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 But I think I'm asking, how do you incorporate this

695
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 and still be a faithful friend?

696
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 So I actually--actually, I'm going to share something

697
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 that I want you to do tonight.

698
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Y'all are young.

699
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 I don't care what time you have to wake up tomorrow.

700
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 You're going out tonight, and let me tell you why.

701
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 You are. That's your assignment.

702
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 You're going out.

703
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 How about that?

704
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 You're going out.

705
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 You're going to grab--I'm serious.

706
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 I don't care if they're strangers.

707
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 You're going to grab four or five people.

708
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 I know, somebody's going to get married because I just did this.

709
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 [laughter]

710
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 I want you to grab no more than five, six people, okay?

711
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 Sit at a table together.

712
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 I want you to go out tonight. Here's why.

713
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 One of my friends is here.

714
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Her grandmother wrote her a letter.

715
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 Well, today's 2/22/22.

716
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 The next time this will happen is 3/33/3033,

717
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 that there's this many numbers in a day.

718
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 And she said this won't happen for a thousand plus years.

719
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 A thousand plus years that you'll have a date like you have today.

720
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 It's funny. I don't know.

721
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 She said--she hand wrote these letters to her grandkids.

722
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 She said, "I want you to do something you'll never forget on 2/22/22.

723
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 For the rest of your life, you'll tell your grandkids,

724
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 on 2/22/22, I did this thing."

725
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Okay? I'm going to give you your thing tonight.

726
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 You're going out.

727
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 And you're going to be vulnerable.

728
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 Awkwardly so.

729
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 And you're never going to forget it.

730
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 And you're going to sit across from each other,

731
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 and you're going to celebrate.

732
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 And I don't know what that looks like for you,

733
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 if it's like cooking s'mores or what.

734
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 But you're going to celebrate.

735
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 You're going to do something.

736
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 And we--you know, we're at church.

737
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 But you know, just whatever you've got to do,

738
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 that you're going to celebrate.

739
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 And you're going to do that tonight.

740
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 And you're going to do--I say you all take that with you,

741
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 and you try to answer it.

742
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 Like, take a picture of it.

743
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 Can we put it back up one more time,

744
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 in case now they realize I might get married,

745
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 so I'm going to answer the question.

746
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 And you're going to share with each other the answer to this.

747
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 This isn't a big deal, but it is actually what's really going on

748
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 behind the things going on.

749
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 That's what I want you to learn.

750
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 If you share the thing that's going on behind the things

751
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 that are going on, you have connection.

752
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 And what happens when you start to have connection

753
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 is your anxiety goes down.

754
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 I don't know how it happens.

755
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 You could tell me, your wife could tell me.

756
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 But physically, it happened to me the other night.

757
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 I started to share the things behind the things

758
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 that were going on, and I took a deeper breath,

759
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 and my shoulders rolled back, and I was--

760
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 I just could breathe better.

761
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 And so you're going to do that tonight.

762
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 And you're going to go somewhere right now.

763
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 You're going to pull out your phone

764
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 and text somebody in the room.

765
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 You have to have been in the room.

766
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 You can't do it with other people,

767
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 because they're going to be bugged.

768
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 You only can do it with the people in the room.

769
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Will you all do this for real?

770
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 Come on. Go to Sonic. It's open.

771
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 People are, like, pointing to girls,

772
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 like, "I'm going to go with her. I'll go with her."

773
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 I don't care, because the point is this,

774
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 that you can do it.

775
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 The point is we can go deeper.

776
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 The point is next time you're going to run an errand alone,

777
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 you can ask a friend to go with you.

778
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 The point is instead of working out by yourself

779
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 in the morning, you can make a little workout group.

780
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 The point is you can make choices

781
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 that cause you to not be so disconnected.

782
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 That is my prayer for you,

783
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 and that you all go, share your souls out,

784
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 and fall in love.

785
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 [laughter]

786
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 Oh, man. All right.

787
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 What would you leave them with?

788
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 That may be it.

789
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 That's it.

790
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 We pray.

791
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 Man, that 222-22 thing.

792
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 I'm like, "We got to go do something."

793
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 Celebrate.

794
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 It's going to be a thousand years.

795
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 Where am I going to tell my grandkids?

796
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 I'm going to Sonic,

797
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 and I am getting rid of my toaster.

798
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 Oh, man.

799
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 That's such a gift.

800
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 Can I share one thing, and then will you pray for us?

801
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 Ben, you guys can come up.

802
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 I'm going to have Jenny in,

803
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 and then you guys can play.

804
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 Today at my house, my wife called me during lunch,

805
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 and I was talking to Sam,

806
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 and she said, "There's a gas leak in our house.

807
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 "It smells like gas like crazy."

808
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 She's got a three-week-old, our other two kids,

809
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 and I'm in a meeting,

810
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 and I basically was trying to go,

811
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 "Hey, I'll call you right back."

812
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 She goes, "You're not calling me back.

813
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 "There's a gas leak. It smells like gas."

814
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 I'm like, "Okay, I'm leaving the meeting."

815
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 I'm walking out, and Sam says,

816
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 "You should tell her to call 911.

817
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 "You should call 911."

818
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 Of course, I call 911 and get to the house.

819
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 Long story short, everything ended up being okay,

820
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 but they went through, and they tested it,

821
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 and basically confirmed what the problem was.

822
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 It's kind of irrelevant, but everything was fine.

823
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 I share that because whenever there's a situation

824
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 where there's a fire, there's a problem,

825
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 there's something going on, we know what to do.

826
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 We know who to call.

827
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 911.

828
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 Really, what I love about this book is

829
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 when it comes to the challenges and problems

830
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 and heartaches and heartbreaks

831
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 and highs and lows of life,

832
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 there isn't a 911 to call,

833
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 but God has given us the blueprint in his word

834
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 to instruct us on how to create the relationships

835
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 of the people that come around you.

836
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 'Cause when you're going through a catastrophic thing,

837
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 you're not gonna call me.

838
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 You're not calling Jenny.

839
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 If you were here, we'd pray for you and come alongside,

840
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 but you have the chance to have people in your life

841
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 that know you intimately

842
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 in a way that nobody on a stage ever will,

843
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 but you can be known,

844
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 and you can experience peace that comes from that.

845
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 And so it's an easy thing,

846
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 and I told you, and I hope this doesn't insult you,

847
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 I've been in community here a long time.

848
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 It's Watermark's middle name.

849
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 - Yeah.

850
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 - And I was so encouraged as I just saw ways

851
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 that I wanna be more connected to those that I run with,

852
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 and experience more of the connection

853
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 God designed us to experience.

854
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 So thank you for articulating and creating a resource

855
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 I think is gonna really serve the church.

856
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 I would highly recommend to everyone here.

857
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 And with that said, will you pray for us?

858
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 - Yeah.

859
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 I will.

860
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 God, you built us.

861
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 You do this.

862
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 You are this.

863
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 I mean, you are Father, Son, Holy Spirit.

864
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 You always were.

865
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 You always will be.

866
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 You in yourself are communal.

867
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 It's who you are.

868
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 And so we come before a communal God

869
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 knowing that we are communal creatures

870
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 that are craving something that you set in us.

871
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 This is a good thing that we are craving.

872
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 This is not something evil.

873
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 This is something good.

874
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 In fact, we are not meant to live alone.

875
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 And for every way we have lived, independent, isolated,

876
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 built fences in our lives, around our souls,

877
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 God, would you tear them down,

878
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 and would we be brave enough to open the door?

879
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 So let people in to imagine what it could look like.

880
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 To imagine what it could look like if we were truly known,

881
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 if we were truly seen, if we were truly soothed and safeguarded.

882
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 That's what you desire for us.

883
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 That's how you actually change us.

884
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 That's how our hearts change.

885
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 It's how they don't harden up.

886
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 It's how they don't get calloused.

887
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 God, we take a deep breath, and we say something awkward,

888
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 and we admit it's hard.

889
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 And as we do that, we feel a deep breath.

890
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 And as we do that, the person across from us thinks,

891
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 "Hey, maybe I am safe here.

892
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 Maybe I can share my thing."

893
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 And we defeat the devil together.

894
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 God, we want to see the darkness and the bondage fall in our lives.

895
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 And we know that your word says that you've not given us a spirit of fear,

896
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 but that you've given us a spirit of power, of love, and self-discipline.

897
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 And, God, I believe the reason we are in so much fear

898
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 is that we're trying to fight the fear alone.

899
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 And so, God, I pray tonight --

900
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 I pray tonight that there would be awkward conversations happening all over Dallas,

901
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 all over Austin, all over the places where people are watching God on this night

902
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 that won't happen again for a thousand years.

903
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 God, I pray that bondage would fall, and the way it falls, God,

904
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 that we wouldn't overcomplicate it, that we'd listen.

905
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 Most of us know the answer to our problems.

906
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 Most of us know the truth.

907
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 But most of us haven't been seen and soothed and safe in a long, long time.

908
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 So would we be people that provide that, make spaces like that,

909
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 that cry with each other, mourn with each other, laugh with each other,

910
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 hug each other, and be together,

911
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 encouraging each other as long as it is called today?

912
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 You've got a good plan.

913
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,540
 Help us live it out.

914
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,320
 In Jesus' name, amen.
