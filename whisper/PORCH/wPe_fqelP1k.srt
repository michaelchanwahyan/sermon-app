1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,960
 Before I walked up here, we sang a song and the song said, "You are awesome in this place."

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,960
 I want to tell you, I absolutely believe that is true, but listen, I also have to acknowledge

3
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
 this.

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,800
 Sometimes this place is not awesome.

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
 Notice that's not what we sang.

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,320
 We didn't say, "This place is awesome, mighty God."

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,560
 Because sometimes this place just, I think in the vernacular of the day, sucks is what

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,400
 you would say about this place.

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,120
 There's a reason when we asked you all what it is that we wanted to talk about, what it

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:05,560
 is that we wanted to study and learn more of, or be reminded of, a disproportionate

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,720
 number of the responses were, "We want to know how to deal with anxiety and peace because

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,320
 this place is not awesome.

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,280
 In fact, this place is freaking me out a little bit at times."

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,680
 And it can.

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,800
 It can freak us out a lot.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,320
 It can fill our hearts with a lot of anxiety.

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,920
 It can fill our hearts with a lot of sadness and despair.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,960
 And so where is this awesome, mighty God when I live in a world that frankly isn't rolling

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,280
 like I thought it would or thought it should or needed to for me to have peace?

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,920
 Well, I hope you were with us last week when David did a great job of talking through Matthew

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,600
 6 and Jesus talking about this issue of anxiety and how he was just pretty straightforward.

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,880
 He said, "Listen, what I don't want you to do is ask for tomorrow's provision today.

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,360
 That doesn't make any sense.

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,640
 You don't need tomorrow's provision today.

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,280
 What you need to do today is seek the God who is awesome in this place.

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,440
 Seek the God who is awesome everywhere that He is.

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,360
 You need to meditate on His character, His nature.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,720
 You need to get to know His name and His history.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,600
 You need to know His resume, His CV, so that you can employ Him in every way in your life

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,720
 because anything other than that is going to wear you out.

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,240
 And so today, with all of your strength, don't worry about tomorrow.

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,720
 Tomorrow what you need to do is what you need to do today, which is seek first the kingdom

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,280
 of God and His righteousness and everything that you need will be given to you.

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,580
 For tomorrow, it says in verse 34, will take care of itself.

35
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,160
 Each day has enough trouble of its own.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,040
 What you need to do today is remind yourself of who God is.

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,440
 And that is the only way that you will not experience anxiety.

38
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,580
 It's the only way that you will not be overwhelmed with fear and despair.

39
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,440
 Anything else, though it might temporarily numb your pain or temporarily distract you

40
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,160
 from your reality, everything else is going to be a temporary salve and it's frankly only

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,640
 going to continually increase trouble in your life because you're going to have to keep

42
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,660
 finding more and more things to distract you and numb you and you'll become more and more

43
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,000
 discouraged that everything you've tried isn't working and so you're going to wonder what

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,360
 could possibly work.

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,920
 And what you will finally eventually do, if you're lucky, you'll get back to a place that

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,920
 God said you should have started to from the very first time.

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,440
 And that is you'll find yourself flat on your back.

48
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,800
 And the great thing about being flat on your back is the only place that you can look is

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,820
 up.

50
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,520
 And up is where our help comes from, the God who is awesome everywhere that He is.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,560
 Now let me just say this about God.

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,920
 One of the characteristics about God is that He is omnipresent.

53
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,380
 God is everywhere, okay?

54
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,480
 That doesn't mean that you can't kill a cockroach or kill an ant like Pantheist would tell you

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,800
 because God is in everything.

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
 No.

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,200
 When we say that God is everywhere, what that means is the sovereign reality of God's perfection

58
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,160
 and goodness is sovereignly over everything, even this world that is not always an awesome

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
 place.

60
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,520
 Which, of course, begs an amazing question which is if God is so good and God is so kind,

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,460
 why is this world so unkind and so ungood?

62
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:23,240
 And if He is everywhere and His awesomeness is directly over everything, why is this world

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,620
 so screwed up?

64
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,560
 And frankly, why is my world so screwed up?

65
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,360
 That is a very fair question.

66
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,720
 And it's one that I hope to answer tonight, not by really dealing with the specific problem

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,920
 of evil, but by telling you what God wants you to know and what He wants you to do so

68
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,880
 that you might have a peace that passes understanding.

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,960
 Because here's the deal.

70
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,200
 What worry is is a constant thinking that God's not going to get it right.

71
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,160
 What bitterness and despair and depression is is a constant belief that God has already

72
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
 got it wrong.

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
 Let me say that again.

74
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,120
 Worry is believing that God's not going to get it right.

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,540
 And so what you've got to do is you eject from confidence and belief in Him and you

76
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,920
 enthrone yourself with some other strategy.

77
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,560
 You try and meet a God-given need in a God-forbidden way or a God-given desire in a God-forbidden

78
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,600
 way.

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,080
 And then next thing you know, you're going to find yourself lacking peace because God

80
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,560
 can't give you what doesn't exist apart from Him.

81
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,360
 If He is the God of peace and you leave Him, you won't get peace.

82
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
 So follow this.

83
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,400
 That's why God says, "Don't you worry about what I'm going to do tomorrow.

84
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,420
 I've got tomorrow.

85
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,880
 Focus on Me."

86
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,000
 That's why God describes Himself this way, "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,120
 Now whenever somebody introduces Himself that way, what you might want to do is go back

88
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,360
 and figure out who is Abraham, who is Isaac, who is Jacob?

89
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,760
 How did God deal with them?

90
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,520
 Was God faithful with them through every circumstance?

91
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,000
 Even when they weren't faithful, was God still faithful with them?

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Did God come through?

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,240
 Did God promise them something?

94
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,280
 And did He not eventually accomplish it?

95
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,720
 And the answer you will see is yes.

96
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,200
 And so what God is doing is He's saying, "Hey, don't take My word for it.

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,600
 Ask everybody that's ever followed Me."

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,880
 If you ever want to go to a church that's preaching a real short message, look for a

99
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,000
 pastor that the title of his message is, "The Mistakes and Apologies of God," because that's

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,720
 going to be a very short sermon.

101
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,840
 There is none.

102
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:29,200
 Because in addition to being omnipresent, we know that He is good.

103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,960
 And so why are we freaking out if God's awesome in this place and I'm in this place?

104
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,000
 And the answer is because we've got our eyes on this world that is not awesome.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,760
 God says, "By the way, you shouldn't be surprised this world is not awesome," because this place

106
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,920
 is not obeying the God who is awesome right here in this place.

107
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,520
 So here's what I want to do just to start out.

108
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
 Remind you of this.

109
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,880
 Worry is us believing, and this is where it comes from.

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,640
 Anxiety is us thinking that God is not going to get it right.

111
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,240
 Bitterness and depression is us believing that God got it wrong or that we've done something

112
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,280
 so wrong God could never make it right.

113
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,720
 And joy and peace, which is the opposite of anxiety and despair, joy and peace is the

114
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,680
 knowledge that God is sovereign, He is good, He is powerful, and He is intimately acquainted

115
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,880
 with your ways.

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,900
 And that's really what I'm going to offer you tonight.

117
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,040
 What God is going to say is, "Listen, the reason this world is so messed up is even

118
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,680
 though I'm here in the world and I want to do business with everybody and I want to share

119
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:33,240
 my promises and my perspective and give you my revelation so you can see what I see, what

120
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:41,920
 I'm up to, and why we are where we are in this very consistent Christian explanation

121
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,720
 for reality."

122
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,400
 That's what the Bible is.

123
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:55,560
 It is the only working, not philosophy, but it's the only working revelation that we can

124
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,080
 say, "If that is true, then this world makes sense."

125
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,960
 And God can still be awesome even though this is not an awesome place.

126
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
 So here's what I want to do.

127
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,240
 I'm going to tell you the secret to dealing with your number one need, which according

128
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,560
 to you is anxiety and despair, fear and anxiousness, is having a real understanding that what we

129
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,360
 sang a minute ago is true and that as God you are awesome, period, and that you know

130
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,760
 me and that you love me.

131
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,600
 And so even though I see things going on around me that would seem to indicate that either

132
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,360
 you're not sovereign over this moment or that you're not awesome if you are sovereign over

133
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,920
 this moment, I'm going to go back to what I know is true.

134
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:41,840
 And I'm going to believe that you care about me and that if you inserted my name, the God

135
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:51,320
 of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Todd, that your resume would still be perfect.

136
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,120
 And so what I want to do is introduce you to this God tonight.

137
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,680
 Look, we've got to go back and we've got to believe what Jeremiah 29 11 says.

138
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
 Now watch.

139
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,400
 I'm going to just quote to you Jeremiah 29 11 first where God says, "For I know the plans

140
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,680
 that I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to give you a future and a hope, plans for

141
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,840
 welfare and not for calamity."

142
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,280
 Which when you hear that verse, you go, "Man, cool, I will chill."

143
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,160
 That's why so many of us, if you have ever picked the favorite Bible verse, love Jeremiah

144
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
 29 11.

145
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,560
 Oh man, that just, is that true Todd?

146
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,280
 That there's a God and his plans for me to give me a future and a hope?

147
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,200
 And his plans for me are for welfare?

148
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,360
 Oh man, why didn't somebody tell me that?

149
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,600
 Because now I can sleep, now I can stop freaking out about what I've done or what's going to

150
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
 happen.

151
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,760
 All right, and let me just say this to you.

152
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:47,600
 I hate to ruin your favorite Bible verse by putting it in context, but you need to see

153
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,080
 the context of that verse.

154
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,780
 That is God telling people who are not just filled with anxiety and dread, their world

155
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:04,200
 is a result of them not knowing God and walking with God and rejecting God as the source of

156
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,120
 their provision, protection and peace.

157
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,880
 And therefore, they are not having a very good day, their future doesn't look all that

158
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,920
 bright, their hope is gone, and they've got no welfare and nothing but calamity.

159
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,320
 That's what Jeremiah, and God's over there going, "Yoo-hoo, over here.

160
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,240
 For I can tell you what I've got over here, but you've rejected me and so even though

161
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,520
 I'm awesome everywhere I am and I'm sovereign over there, I'm choosing to let you have what

162
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,560
 you have chose.

163
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,280
 And I'm awesome in that place over there too.

164
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,820
 I don't, you don't need to be physically over here, you need to be by faith related to me

165
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,880
 and walking in my ways."

166
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,720
 Let me just insert this to you because I want to tell you that nobody, I don't at least,

167
00:10:50,720 --> 00:11:02,640
 I don't look at you and scoff at you because you're anxious or fearful or sometimes despairing.

168
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:10,680
 Probably arguably the most brilliant theologian of the previous century felt the exact same

169
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
 way.

170
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,760
 And you go, "Well wait a minute, Todd, that seems really bizarre to me because you're

171
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,320
 up there and you're going to try and tell us tonight how we cannot be this person that

172
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,640
 is like everybody else in this world which is overwhelmed and despairing and anxious

173
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,800
 and you just told me the guy that knows more about God and who's probably done more to

174
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,960
 reveal who God is through creative narratives and storytelling and just incredible intellect

175
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,400
 and rationale, that guy felt like I forgot that God forgot him and he was despairing?"

176
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,640
 Yes, I'm going to read you from his journal.

177
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,200
 Now look, if that guy was alive, there was about three decades of his life that he couldn't

178
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,440
 come to the porch even though he was single because the guy was 50 and still single, never

179
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,680
 had married.

180
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:05,480
 And finally, finally, after 50 years of chaste life, he came to know God later in his life.

181
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,880
 He wasn't a believer all those days but he lived a chaste life and eventually found a

182
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,280
 woman that he absolutely loved and he married her.

183
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,440
 And by the way, now he knew Christ and he was writing these amazing works, actually

184
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,000
 doing radio programs broadcast all over England at the time that were just radically transforming

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,160
 his culture and you think if God's going to be nice and kind to anybody, it'd be this

186
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
 guy.

187
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:39,720
 Well, four years in to finally finding a woman he loves, he loses her to cancer.

188
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,720
 And so that's going to shake him to the core and he starts despairing.

189
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,080
 And this is what he writes, he says, "Meanwhile, where is God?"

190
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,840
 This is one of the most disquieting symptoms of going through pain like this, of grief.

191
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,760
 When you're happy, so happy that you have no sense of needing him, so happy that you're

192
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,200
 tempted to feel his claims upon you as an interruption, if you remember yourself and

193
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,720
 turn to him with gratitude and praise, you will be, or at least so it feels, welcome

194
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,860
 with open arms.

195
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,200
 But go to him when your need is desperate, when all other help is in vain, and what do

196
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
 you find?

197
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,560
 A door slammed in your face.

198
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,420
 A sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside.

199
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,420
 After that, silence.

200
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,600
 You may as well turn away.

201
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,920
 The longer you wait, the more emphatic the silence will become.

202
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,280
 There are no lights in the windows.

203
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,600
 It might be an empty house.

204
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
 Was it ever inhabited?

205
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,560
 It seemed so once, and that seeming was as strong as this.

206
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
 What can this mean?

207
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,760
 Why is God so present a commander in our time of prosperity and so very absent a help in

208
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,040
 time of trouble?

209
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
 What a great question.

210
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,320
 Can I just start by just saying this?

211
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,720
 Being tempted to believe that God is not awesome is not sin.

212
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,240
 I'm constantly tempted to believe that God is not awesome in this place or awesome at

213
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,760
 all.

214
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,480
 Now what you do with that temptation is going to make the difference between whether or

215
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,560
 not you're going to be a person who walks out of here tonight and lives in a peace that

216
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,880
 passes understanding or if you take that bait based on what you see and what you're experiencing

217
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,040
 and you snap on that and you go, "You know what?

218
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
 God isn't good.

219
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
 God's word isn't true.

220
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
 God can't be trusted.

221
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,960
 Disobeying him has got to be better than obeying him."

222
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:32,720
 Because you feel like he's forgotten you, then you will continually be anxious and I'm

223
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,240
 going to prove it to you tonight.

224
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,000
 God won't be mad at you, but he's just going to keep saying not your favorite Bible verse,

225
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,280
 but God's favorite thing to remind you of, which is I know how you're feeling.

226
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,960
 I know what you're going through.

227
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,160
 Listen, by the way, the reason you're going through that is because you're not enjoying

228
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,120
 me, the God who is awesome.

229
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,640
 If you were, you would know who I am.

230
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,680
 You know my plan for you is to give you a future and a hope.

231
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,840
 See, the Bible says this.

232
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,960
 The Bible says that we don't grieve as those who have no hope.

233
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,000
 What I want you to understand what's implied there.

234
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,240
 What's implied there is that you do get to grieve.

235
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,000
 C.S. Lewis is the guy that I'm talking about, the guy who wrote Chronicles of Narnia, the

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,600
 guy who wrote Mere Christianity, the guy who wrote this book I'm reading from called The

237
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,280
 Grief Observed.

238
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,880
 C.S. Lewis grieved.

239
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,400
 Those were deep words of grief.

240
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,320
 Now what's really unfair, what I just did is I cut him off.

241
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,080
 What he did is he sat down and he was honest to God.

242
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,320
 See, God's a big boy.

243
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
 He's a father.

244
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
 I'm a dad.

245
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
 I got six kids.

246
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,280
 I understand sometimes my kids don't know what I know.

247
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,840
 They haven't lived the life that I've lived.

248
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,400
 They don't have the information that I have.

249
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,160
 Sometimes they are not happy with me and they don't want to trust me.

250
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,760
 In fact, they're railing in all their adolescent rage against my counsel or against even at

251
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:02,640
 times my sovereign awesomeness to keep them from being idiots.

252
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,760
 When I say, "Listen, your daddy is awesome in this place," they go, "No, he's not.

253
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,560
 If he was awesome, my friends would think I was a geek.

254
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,080
 My friends would not be having fun at the party tonight and I wouldn't be," and on and

255
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,520
 on and on it might go.

256
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,200
 Because Lord knows everybody else is doing it, right?

257
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,960
 They seem to be getting away with it, whatever it is, and having a heck of a time.

258
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,880
 As they get older, by the way, I do what any loving father does.

259
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,240
 I don't rule their life in the exact same way.

260
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
 I've trained them.

261
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,880
 I've done everything I can to show them my character, my nature, that it's not for me

262
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,520
 that I give them these instructions, it's because I love them and I give them freedom.

263
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,440
 Sometimes I've got to say, "How's that working out over there?

264
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,240
 I know the plans I have for you.

265
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,320
 My plans were to give you a future and a hope.

266
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,640
 My plans for welfare, not for calamity, but I'm going to love you enough that the only

267
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,080
 way that you can learn is through calamity, then go through learning through calamity."

268
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,480
 Let me just tell you guys something.

269
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,400
 Experience isn't a masterful teacher.

270
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,940
 It's just a very expensive one.

271
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,820
 Some of you guys in this room know that the world does not give you what it says it's

272
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
 going to give you for long.

273
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,040
 You've learned that the hard way.

274
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,700
 Even though God told you from the beginning that he's where life is, some of you go, "I

275
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,660
 think I'll see if there's life somewhere else."

276
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
 You know what, man?

277
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,260
 That rocket ride starts pretty good at the beginning, but inevitably, inevitably you

278
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,140
 come back and you go, "This isn't all it's cranked up to be."

279
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,860
 They don't show you the end of the story a lot in those music videos or in those movie

280
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:38,260
 scenes, or my friends that have bragged about all their experiences haven't told me about

281
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:45,900
 the still of the night and the pain of the heart.

282
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,940
 See the story I read from C.S. Lewis was just page one of an entire journal entry where

283
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,580
 he continued to tell his father how he felt, but he stayed there and let his father speak

284
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
 to him.

285
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:05,380
 I'm going to tell you one of the keys to dealing with your anxiety and one of the keys

286
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:11,980
 to dealing with your pain and with your sadness is to learn to trust in the revelation and

287
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
 the word of God.

288
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,380
 One of the things that you have to do as you begin to really struggle is to remember in

289
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,600
 your questioning to quietly listen.

290
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:30,660
 In your wrestling, remember revelation, things that God has already told you and explained

291
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,660
 to you.

292
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,180
 This is an amazing verse in Isaiah chapter 40.

293
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,980
 It just says this, "Why do you assert, O Jacob," by the way, I'm going to tell you just a little

294
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,740
 bit more about Jeremiah 29, but in Isaiah 40 he's talking to the exact same people that

295
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,700
 he's talking to there in Jeremiah 29.

296
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,860
 It says, "Why do you say, O Jacob," it's the name for the nation of Israel, "Why do you

297
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,980
 assert that my way is hidden from the Lord and that justice dubious escapes the notice

298
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
 of my God?"

299
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
 Why would you ever say that?

300
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
 Have you ever said that?

301
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,020
 Not in those same kind of poetic words where you go, "God, why have you not noticed me?

302
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,460
 Why does the justice do me escape you?

303
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,820
 If you're awesome, why is my life the way that it is?"

304
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,900
 This is what the scriptures say, the prophet Isaiah says, "Do you not know?

305
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,900
 Have you not heard?

306
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,560
 The everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, he does not become

307
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,420
 weary or tired, his understanding is inscrutable, he is awesome in this place.

308
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,300
 He gives strength to the weary and to him who lacks might, he increases power, though

309
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:39,060
 youth grow weary and tired and vigorous young men, porch going young men stumble badly.

310
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,260
 Yet those who wait for the Lord," you see that word right there?

311
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,940
 That's the word that you're going to have to learn to embrace if you want to deal with

312
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,440
 your anxiety.

313
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:55,260
 Those who wait for the Lord will not be anxious, they'll gain new strength.

314
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,660
 They're going to mount up on wings like eagles.

315
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
 What do eagle's wings do?

316
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,300
 They catch that little, they catch that air and it just pulls them up.

317
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,660
 They'll mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they won't be

318
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,980
 despairing people.

319
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,460
 They will walk and not become weary.

320
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,980
 See that's not your story, you might go, "Todd, I'm anxious, I'm weary, I'm 26, I'm single,

321
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,060
 it's been a long time since I've had a date.

322
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,940
 I don't know if I can wait until I'm 50 to get married so that my wife dies in four years

323
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,100
 so I can be angry at God again."

324
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:32,900
 Well, I want you to wait until you're 50 to get married, I want you to wait today on God.

325
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,860
 I want you to really wait and see what he says he is.

326
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,540
 I want you to tune in, are you ready?

327
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,860
 Now let me just take one more second, I want to explain to you what is going on in Jeremiah

328
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,260
 chapter 29 because in Jeremiah chapter 29 again, the context of this passage is the

329
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,100
 reason that you're filled with despair Israel and filled with anxiety is because you have

330
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,220
 rejected me.

331
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,140
 This is the context, this is the verses around your favorite Bible verse.

332
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,900
 In Jeremiah 29 10, "For thus says the Lord God, when 70 years have been completed for

333
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:11,000
 Babylon," in other words, there's going to be a season where you're going to experience

334
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,740
 life without me because that's the only way you're going to really learn that I'm good,

335
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,500
 you won't believe me while you're here.

336
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,460
 By the way, you can be at church for a long time just like my buddy JP said earlier tonight,

337
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,580
 "I was around church for a long time but I was never in relationship with the awesome

338
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,580
 God."

339
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,780
 Right, you've heard all the silly analogies, just because you come to a church doesn't

340
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,040
 mean you're an abiding Christian anymore than sleeping in your garage tonight won't make

341
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:39,020
 you a car.

342
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:44,440
 There's got to be some characteristic about you in that garage that makes you a car and

343
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,800
 there has to be some characteristic about you in this place that will make you an abiding

344
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:57,680
 Christ follower which is the person who is peace that passes understanding.

345
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,600
 What he's saying is you're here with me Israel, you're in this land filled with milk and honey,

346
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,840
 this land where the temple is but you haven't been walking with me, you don't know me and

347
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,240
 you have not observed my commandments and so God's going to let them have the consequences

348
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,480
 of not knowing him.

349
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,320
 In this case, it was being driven away from that land for 70 years and he says after you're

350
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:22,320
 there for 70 years and you realize that every other option for peace can't be found, you're

351
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,000
 going to come back and maybe go, "Maybe we should try listening to the God we've always

352
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 known about."

353
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:37,840
 And he says this in verse 12, "Then you will call upon me and come to me and pray to me

354
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
 and I will listen to you."

355
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,440
 In other words, this is what you need to really remind yourself, okay?

356
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,120
 When you're despairing, you got to go, listen, my favorite Bible verse is Jeremiah 29 and

357
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,120
 11 which says, "I know the plans you have for me," says the Lord, "plans to give you

358
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,720
 a future and a hope, plans for welfare and a calamity if I repent of my trying to find

359
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,500
 life and peace apart from him.

360
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,600
 If I return to him and meditate on him and I stop worrying about what's going to happen

361
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,240
 to me tomorrow or the next day and today I seek first God and his kingdom and his righteousness,

362
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,540
 then he tells me I will experience that."

363
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:19,700
 That is a verse that is calling you to return and to repent.

364
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,520
 Verse 13 just continues to emphasize this, "You will seek me and you will find me when

365
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,320
 you search me with all your heart."

366
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,520
 What did Jesus say was the key to not having anxiety?

367
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,880
 See, this is why Jesus was so brilliant.

368
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
 He knew his Bible.

369
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,520
 People go, "Well, how do I deal with anxiety?"

370
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,240
 He goes, "Well, seek first God and his kingdom, man."

371
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
 He didn't say go to church.

372
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,760
 He didn't say be in a community group.

373
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,480
 He said, "Listen, use your community to remind you of the goodness of God.

374
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,760
 Be in a church that calls you to abide with the God that they sing about and talk about."

375
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,160
 And then it says in verse 14, "I will be found by you," declares the Lord.

376
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,640
 "I will restore you.

377
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
 I will restore your fortunes.

378
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,440
 I will gather you from all the nations, from all the places where I have driven you," declares

379
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
 the Lord.

380
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,680
 "I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you."

381
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
 Here's the truth.

382
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,360
 Sometimes, I just need to let you know, sometimes your anxiety is not a sign of your insanity,

383
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,880
 it's a sign of your reality.

384
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,200
 I mean, one of the things you need to know is that sometimes God gives you over to anxiety

385
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,560
 so that you might go, "What I'm doing is not working."

386
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
 Now here's the problem.

387
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:31,680
 You live in a world that wants to keep you from going anywhere but to God.

388
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,680
 This world does not call you to repent.

389
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,640
 That's just way too old-fashioned.

390
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,720
 So the world's smarter than God.

391
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,720
 And so what the world says is, "Take this pill.

392
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,320
 What we gotta do is just mix the cocktail, the pharmaceuticals that we give you, or maybe

393
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,600
 sex isn't enough so we gotta spice it up.

394
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:03,060
 And if you have sex this way, then you'll start to really find life.

395
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,240
 Or maybe it's your career, or maybe it's your current boyfriend or girlfriend, or maybe

396
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
 it's your current spouse.

397
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,480
 Let's just hit reset on that and go somewhere else."

398
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,240
 In the world, mostly though, when you finally try all those things and you're still sad,

399
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,280
 you'll go see a doctor, "Doctor, I don't know what's wrong with me."

400
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,480
 And he'll say, "Look, take this and you'll feel better."

401
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,040
 And you might feel better, but here's the thing, you're just masking the pain.

402
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,760
 You're dealing with an infection, not with an antibiotic, but with a painkiller, and

403
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,260
 that leaves the infection there.

404
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,560
 The Bible says that sometimes we are where we are because of the choices that we make.

405
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,640
 See if this doesn't sound like a person who is depressed.

406
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,520
 This is a guy named David.

407
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
 It's in Psalm 32.

408
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,520
 He says, "I'm gonna tell you what, you know who the blessed guy is?

409
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,240
 The blessed guy is the guy whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered by the awesome

410
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,360
 God.

411
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,160
 How blessed is that man to whom the Lord does not give what he deserves to him."

412
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,520
 That's what impute iniquity means.

413
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,480
 "In whose spirit there is no deceit."

414
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,000
 In other words, his spirit is inclined towards truth, not error.

415
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,800
 David said, "Let me just tell you my story.

416
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,120
 When I was silent about my sin, my body wasted away through my groaning all day long."

417
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
 Do you know anybody like that?

418
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,880
 By the way, you might be that guy where you're just kinda like, "Oh, my job, my boyfriend,

419
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,600
 my body image, my career, my story, my history, my parents, my family of origin."

420
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,820
 He says, "For day and night, your hand was heavy upon me.

421
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,320
 My vitality was drained away as with a fever heat of summer.

422
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,600
 But then I acknowledged my sin to you and my iniquity I did not hide.

423
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,840
 I said, 'I'm gonna confess that I've been trying to figure out how to do life without

424
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
 you God and you forgave me.'"

425
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,320
 See, there's a word, Selah, that's in there.

426
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,960
 Before that he said, "Do you remember how bad life was?"

427
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,680
 And he just stops right there.

428
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,680
 That Selah means pause, just sit and remember and meditate.

429
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,720
 It's why I tell a lot of people who come to me that I talk to who are really struggling,

430
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,320
 I go, "Hey, man, you know what you need to do?

431
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:13,000
 You need to go home right now and you need to journal how lonely and filled with self-hate

432
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,840
 and despair you are."

433
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,040
 Because believe it or not, believe it or not, if you listen to me and you respond to God,

434
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:29,120
 there's gonna be a day that you forget how bad it is to turn away from him.

435
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:37,080
 And you have to be able to go back and read your own testimony of anxiousness and fear

436
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,520
 and despairing when you leave God.

437
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,200
 I know you think you'll never forget this, but I'm gonna tell you something, you will

438
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,800
 forget this pain, you will forget this guilt, you will forget this shame.

439
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,120
 Don't waste the pain.

440
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,480
 Write it down right now.

441
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,200
 That's called Selah, just sit in it.

442
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,440
 But then he says, "But then I also acknowledge my sin to God and my iniquity I did not hide,

443
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,560
 I confess and God forgave me."

444
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,920
 And then you just go, you go meditate on that, man, that God says, "You're forgiven, I'm

445
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
 not angry at you."

446
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,280
 See, here's the deal with my kids, I just had this conversation this week with one of

447
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,600
 my children, I said, "I'm not mad, man, you won't believe how quickly I want to restore

448
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
 all the relationship.

449
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:22,240
 I'm just looking for humility, I'm just looking for honest, broken, contrite hearts.

450
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,040
 I can work with that."

451
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,880
 I want to turn this judgment that I've got to leave you in into blessing and you won't

452
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,160
 believe how quickly I want to turn it into blessing.

453
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,480
 That's what God's saying to you tonight.

454
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,640
 He knows where you've been, you don't have to manage that information, He already knows.

455
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,320
 You just got to go, "God, this isn't working out."

456
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,480
 He goes, "I know it's not working out.

457
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,160
 This is not a good day, I know it's not a good day."

458
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,600
 And God's over here, "Return to me, come."

459
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,240
 And He's ready to start working with you.

460
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,080
 Now listen, that doesn't mean that there's not some things you got to deal with that

461
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,400
 are real, but He said, "Let's start to deal with them."

462
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,800
 And you're going to find that I'll even take this darkest, saddest part of your life and

463
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,640
 I will redeem it.

464
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,280
 I'll use it for good.

465
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,680
 And I didn't need you to do that so I could turn it to good, but watch, this is what I

466
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
 do.

467
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,880
 I take ashes and I make them beautiful.

468
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,720
 I take what you intended for evil and I use it for glory.

469
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,360
 That's what God does and only God can do.

470
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,000
 David just says, "Therefore man, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you

471
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 might be found.

472
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,400
 But if you are in the flood of great waters, you will not reach Him."

473
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:33,800
 The truth is, is sometimes God is just, He's like the prodigal father.

474
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,320
 You're waiting on Him to rescue you, but here's what God does.

475
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640
 God stands there and He tells you where He is.

476
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,320
 And He says, "Come, come."

477
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,840
 And He'll whisper to you, "I'm there, I'm not mad at you.

478
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,200
 You know, you're my daughter, you're beautiful.

479
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,840
 I know, there you are again in somebody else's arms trying to find meaning and acceptance,

480
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,720
 just come here, come to me."

481
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,240
 And God will run to you and He'll run to you in whispers.

482
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,400
 I had a guy who came to me one time and I mean, this guy was not just struggling with

483
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,880
 anxiety, I mean this guy had an anxiety disorder that was off the charts.

484
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,160
 He had all kinds of medications that he was taking.

485
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,400
 He could hardly get out of his house.

486
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,720
 He couldn't hold a job because on any given day he'd be so freaked out that he was going

487
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:20,000
 to die or something awful was going to happen to him that he couldn't exercise, he couldn't

488
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,880
 hardly eat, he couldn't function as a normal human.

489
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,800
 And we had a mutual friend and his friend said, "What would you say to him?"

490
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,040
 I go, "I'll tell you exactly what I'd say to him."

491
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,320
 I mean, just let me ask you this, who does he know that really loves the Lord and does

492
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
 he know the Lord?

493
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
 He goes, "No, he's got no relationship with God."

494
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,840
 I go, "I know what I'd say to him, just drive him over."

495
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,360
 And so he drove this guy over and he sat down with me.

496
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
 I said, "Tell me your story."

497
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,200
 And this guy was scared to death.

498
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,240
 He goes, "Well, I mean, Todd, I tried to even drive myself.

499
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,920
 I didn't want my friend to have to drive me, but I got out to my car and I started it and

500
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,520
 I turned it off and I ran back upstairs."

501
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
 He said, "My life's a mess."

502
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,920
 And he went on and on and on and on.

503
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,560
 I go, "Well, what are you scared of?

504
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,760
 What's got you so anxious?"

505
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,880
 And then he went on to tell me and I just said, "Can I just tell you something, bro?

506
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
 You're not insane.

507
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,580
 You're the only sane person I know.

508
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,200
 You just got through telling me you don't believe there's a God.

509
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,920
 You just got through telling me you don't believe if there's a God that he's good.

510
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,800
 You just got through telling me that you've got nothing in this world but yourself to

511
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,000
 hope in."

512
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,600
 That ought to make you absolutely frozen in fear and despair because I got to tell you

513
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,880
 something, every single one of you guys, you see God's put eternity in your hearts and

514
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,880
 you know that one day you're going to come to an end.

515
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,720
 He's put mortality in your mirror.

516
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,760
 You see that you're dying.

517
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,600
 And what everyone else in the world tries to do, they try and kick the can down the

518
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,440
 road and they try and ignore this reality.

519
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,360
 And I'm just telling you, I told that guy, I go, "Listen, man, you're the only sane atheist

520
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,320
 I know.

521
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,120
 Every other atheist I know is still trying to convince themselves that life is good,

522
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,920
 that judgment's not real, that they can find life apart from a God that really does exist

523
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,880
 and that says life is only found in Him and that everybody else has always failed to find

524
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,080
 true meaning and peace in everything the world offers, that they're going to be the first

525
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
 one that finds it."

526
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,840
 Those are the people that are crazy.

527
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,720
 You, my friend, are sane.

528
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,080
 The problem is in your sanity and your awareness of the despairing state of being a mortal

529
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,120
 man who stands in judgment before a holy God is you're not doing what a really wise man

530
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,160
 would do, which is to avail yourself to His mercy.

531
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,800
 And bro, I got to tell you, I think if you'll do that, I think you'll see everything change.

532
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
 And let me just tell you about that guy.

533
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
 He's not mad at you.

534
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
 He loves you.

535
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:41,560
 And he wants you to come out of this 70 years of exile and return to him.

536
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:48,440
 See, I want to tell you that's what God wants for you.

537
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
 And this happens to all of us.

538
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
 It happens to C.S. Lewis.

539
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
 It's going to happen to me tonight.

540
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,360
 There's going to be a time when I move into this exile, this Babylonian place where something's

541
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,960
 not going the way that I want and I'm going to start to move away from God's not good,

542
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,840
 God can't be trusted, God's word's not true, and I'm going to start to have my world melt

543
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,320
 around me and God's going to say, "Todd, return to me.

544
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,440
 Listen, remember, I'm a good God.

545
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
 I've got good plans.

546
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
 I've got welfare.

547
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
 I've got future.

548
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
 I've got hope.

549
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
 But you're going to have to trust me.

550
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
 Okay, your feelings are real.

551
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
 What you see is real.

552
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,000
 But listen, gang, can I just say this to you?

553
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Feelings are real.

554
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,800
 They're just not reliable.

555
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,800
 They're not reliable.

556
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,480
 Let me read you this.

557
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,360
 I got this prayer request not long ago.

558
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,720
 It's from a mom.

559
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,360
 She said, "My precious son, raised in the Lord, I believe called to ministry, gifted

560
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,400
 and anointed.

561
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,480
 He was baited with the temptation of lust at an early age.

562
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,000
 He was later lured into a relationship and then sought counsel from a leader at his school

563
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:01,160
 who instead of calling him to repentance, encouraged him to explore and trust his flesh

564
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,560
 all the more.

565
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,080
 This leader comforted him and had many deep conversations with him and said that she had

566
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,480
 similar torment until she trusted her own flesh and followed her own lifestyle choices

567
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,240
 and urged him to be himself and to not live for anybody else.

568
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,720
 My son ultimately chose to strengthen himself in the Lord.

569
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,320
 He received biblical counsel.

570
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,720
 He resisted for a time, but later he began dabbling in pornography unbeknownst to us

571
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,520
 as well as alternate solutions to his pain.

572
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,520
 When he learned to drive, he gave in to the temptation and he wholeheartedly entered into

573
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,600
 more and more illicit relationships.

574
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,080
 Social media at that point increasingly began to tell the story of his struggles and decline

575
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,880
 into sin and death.

576
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:59,040
 And waves of well-meaning Christian friends sometimes encouraged him and celebrated his

577
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:07,160
 exploring all of life and bravery in pursuing freedom and who he really was.

578
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,880
 Our hearts broke.

579
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,200
 Words utterly failed how we felt at this time.

580
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,320
 We told him that we could not continue to allow him to make these choices, that we had

581
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,600
 raised him in truth, we wanted to walk in that truth.

582
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,640
 He insisted that we not even mention any of that ever again.

583
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,040
 We could not be silent and he left.

584
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:34,240
 At times he would come home in anger because we would not just endorse his choices, but

585
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,540
 we kept seeking godly counsel and increasingly held him accountable for his choices all the

586
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,720
 while reminding him that we loved him.

587
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:48,720
 Since then, watch this, our son has transformed into this person that he has never been.

588
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,120
 He had always been kind and generous, hilarious.

589
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:58,760
 Now he's moody, now he's cross, now he's miserable, now he's anxious, now he's angry.

590
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,860
 He's also begun drinking and I believe using drugs.

591
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,820
 My husband and our other three children have shown unconditional, nonjudgmental love throughout

592
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,240
 this devastating season.

593
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,200
 When he calls, we mostly listen.

594
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,040
 Sometimes he will go to dinner with us.

595
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,320
 Rarely will he ever come home and if he does, it's only for very short visits.

596
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,560
 All of this to say, someone, someone from your church has recently reached out to him

597
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,840
 and been a faithful witness to him.

598
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,900
 Our son's battling a lot of emotional issues.

599
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
 He believes that he's bipolar.

600
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,740
 Let me just tell you something, this kid is not bipolar.

601
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,880
 He's not bisexual.

602
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,440
 This kid is struggling, in my opinion, because he wants to continue to try and find peace

603
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,360
 apart from God and that anxiety is sanity.

604
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
 Because he knows the truth.

605
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,960
 He's tried to find life in this for a long time and it doesn't give him life.

606
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,080
 It just gives him more sadness.

607
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,800
 Even though there's moments of euphoria and escape from his pain, there are seasons of

608
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
 despair.

609
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,320
 That will make you very anxious.

610
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,840
 The world's solution is gonna say, "No, no, man.

611
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,440
 "Let's take some of this and we can numb that pain."

612
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
 It's not God's solution.

613
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
 What is God's solution?

614
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,960
 Here's God's solution, be honest.

615
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,600
 Just like C.S. Lewis was, but watch, stick in there.

616
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,080
 What I'm gonna do is I don't have time to read you the rest of a grief observance, it's

617
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,480
 like 100 pages, but what I wanna tell you where C.S. Lewis got his idea.

618
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
 You ready?

619
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
 It's in Psalm 13.

620
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
 Here's what I want you to know.

621
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,600
 This is what you gotta remember.

622
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:31,720
 Remember in all your questioning and all your anxious wondering, remember to quietly listen.

623
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,640
 Here's David again.

624
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,040
 And I want you to listen to the way David talks to the father.

625
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:44,880
 And I want you to know as a father, I don't have any trouble sometimes with my kids sobbing

626
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,800
 and go, "God, how long, man?

627
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,120
 "How long are the popular kids who are compromising "in every way you told me I should, how long

628
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,800
 "are they gonna prosper and I'm gonna feel this deep pain "in my heart, how long?"

629
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,280
 And I just get to hold them.

630
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,880
 I get to remind them of their beauty and dignity and their value.

631
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,480
 And they go, "Yeah, yeah, you're just my dad, "you've gotta say that."

632
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,280
 Just like, "Yeah, yeah, God, I know you feel that way."

633
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,640
 I just wanna experience that here a little bit.

634
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
 Watch David.

635
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,800
 He says this, "How long, oh Lord, "will you forget me forever?

636
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,960
 "How long will you hide your face from me?

637
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,840
 "How long shall I take counsel in my own soul?

638
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,240
 "How, having sorrow in my heart all the day, "how long will my enemy be exalted over me?"

639
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,920
 Now think about this, this is somebody talking to God.

640
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
 This is a man of God's own heart.

641
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,800
 Consider, it's another way to say, "How long, and you answer me, oh Lord, my God,

642
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,800
 "enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death, "and my enemy will say, 'I've overcome

643
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,440
 him,' "and my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken."

644
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,920
 See, I love this, I love what David does here.

645
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,360
 He does what anybody who would know that there's a loving father there would do, who has awesome

646
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,920
 understanding in ways that we don't have.

647
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,680
 He just goes to him, he says, "God, I'm not happy.

648
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,000
 "I don't like what's going on.

649
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 "How long is it going to be this way?"

650
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,880
 But watch what David did, it's what C.S. Lewis did, it's what you've gotta do if you really

651
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,480
 want to learn how to not live an anxious, sad, despairing life.

652
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,160
 You gotta shut up and listen.

653
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,920
 Sometimes people will come to me and they'll go, they'll just say, "Hey Todd, let me ask

654
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
 you a question.

655
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,920
 "What in the world were you thinking?

656
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,920
 "What were you doing?

657
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,640
 "Why did you execute that way?

658
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,200
 "I mean, who would have possibly thought that was the right thing to do?

659
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,280
 "I can't believe that when you were confronted with that opportunity and situation, that's

660
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
 what you did.

661
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,360
 "It makes no sense to me whatsoever.

662
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,400
 "I just don't understand you."

663
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,480
 Boom, shut the door and walk away.

664
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:45,600
 Now, when that happens, I usually open the door and go, "Sweetie, come here, all right?"

665
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:55,320
 My wife doesn't come at me that way, but let's just say somebody did.

666
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,080
 Would you go, "Well Todd, they asked you a question.

667
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,480
 "They did exactly what Psalm 13 says."

668
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,560
 'Cause here's the thing, that person, if they did what I said they did, which is what?

669
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,520
 What'd they do at the very end of that howlongingness?

670
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,360
 What'd I say they did?

671
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,560
 Slam the door and walked away.

672
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,160
 You see, when you do that, you're not asking God.

673
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,080
 You're just there to deliver a message.

674
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,160
 You are incompetent and you are accusing God of not being good, his word not being true,

675
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,360
 and disobeying him has gotta be better than hanging out with his awesomeness.

676
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,440
 Boom, I'm done with you and I'm on my own way.

677
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,120
 It's not what C.S. Lewis did.

678
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,920
 It's not what David did.

679
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,680
 What David did right there is he stopped and there's a word, it's in verse five, the word

680
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
 is "but."

681
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
 It's a word of contrast.

682
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,800
 He said, "But," in verse five, "I have trusted in your loving kindness."

683
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:54,200
 The word for loving kindness is your covenant promise.

684
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,880
 He went back to the promise of God and he meditated on it.

685
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,960
 He said, "My heart shall rejoice in your salvation.

686
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,800
 I will sing to the Lord because he is bound to flee with me."

687
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:15,040
 David sat, that's just two short verses, after all of his ranting, okay, he just stopped.

688
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,080
 And he just went back and he reminded himself of what is true.

689
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,200
 He goes, "It doesn't look like God's good.

690
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
 It doesn't look like he's awesome, but I know he's awesome.

691
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
 I know he's the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

692
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
 What'd you do with Abraham?

693
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
 How'd you do with Isaac?

694
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
 What about Jacob?

695
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
 How'd you do with him?

696
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,200
 Boy, God, it doesn't look like you ever let them go.

697
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,560
 Boy, there were some seasons in there, but I see what you're doing now.

698
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,480
 I get to look back and I see you maketh no mistakes."

699
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:47,240
 Now, you can abandon that God because he doesn't work in your timetable, or you can go, "I'm

700
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,840
 gonna wait."

701
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,480
 Because by the way, I've learned from experience going over there, it works for a season, but

702
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,440
 it makes you feel worse.

703
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,440
 This is exactly, by the way, what you would expect Jesus to have done.

704
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,120
 Jesus himself, and I'll show you at the very end of what I'm about to do in just a moment,

705
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,520
 had a very Psalm 13 moment.

706
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,320
 Jesus was always confronted.

707
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,040
 And by the way, I love Hebrews chapter four in verse 15.

708
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:26,120
 It says, "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,

709
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:32,880
 but we have one who has been tempted in everything as we have been and yet is without sin.

710
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,280
 So therefore, let us draw with confidence to the throne of grace that we might receive

711
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,200
 mercy and find grace to help us in a time of need."

712
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,560
 In other words, Jesus knows what it's like to go, "God, how long, man?

713
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,160
 How long is this gonna go down?

714
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,120
 How long until you answer me?

715
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,240
 My enemies, if you don't do something soon, they're gonna say, 'I've overcome him, and

716
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,800
 my adversaries will rejoice while I am shaken.'"

717
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,120
 And so I love this little story in Matthew chapter four.

718
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:10,040
 It's when Jesus, it says, watch this, in Matthew four, "And Jesus was led by the Spirit."

719
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,200
 In other words, the awesome God goes, "Come here, let me take you in my awesomeness to

720
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,200
 this desert."

721
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,960
 And what did the Spirit of God do?

722
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,400
 He led him into a wilderness, and there he was tempted by the devil.

723
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,200
 I'm gonna show you exactly how he was tempted by the devil, and guess what?

724
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,040
 It's the exact same way Adam was tempted in paradise.

725
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,520
 What you're about to see here is the contrast between what a godly man does and an ungodly

726
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,520
 man does.

727
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,400
 What you're about to see here is how Jesus, in a desert, with no provision, does the right

728
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,280
 thing and at least a blessing, where man, in the perfect place, with all the comforts

729
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,840
 in the world, does the wrong thing and at least a curse.

730
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,460
 So he's in the desert, and it says that he fasted for 40 days and 40 nights.

731
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,120
 And I love the Bible, it's so full of exaggerations, it says, "And he became hungry."

732
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,120
 Okay?

733
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:04,160
 So, by the way, I'm talking to my single friends, and so I know some of you guys are 24 and

734
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,160
 you're still virgins.

735
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,440
 I mean, way to go, all right?

736
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
 Right?

737
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
 You've not really just dove in.

738
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,360
 I don't mean that too sarcastically, although I'm gonna be sarcastic in just a second, all

739
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
 right?

740
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:21,480
 Some of you guys are 28, some of you guys are 34, and you're still virgins.

741
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,480
 Wow.

742
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,760
 Here's what I want you to do.

743
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,880
 I want you to say, "I'm not gonna eat for 40 days."

744
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,760
 And then what I'm gonna do is, whoever you are, you know, when you're, right now, at

745
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,520
 the beginning of your 40-day fast, guys, just write down whoever the girl of your dreams

746
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,520
 is, okay?

747
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,960
 I'm gonna deliver her naked to your bed in 40 days, okay?

748
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,240
 And I'm gonna put a Big Mac next to her.

749
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,280
 I'm gonna say, "Which one?

750
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,280
 What are you up for?"

751
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,280
 All right?

752
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:03,880
 Now, the reason I do that is because you go, "Well, Jesus can't relate to me being a virgin.

753
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,880
 He died when he was 33.

754
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
 I'm 35 years old."

755
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:13,320
 Let's do the 40-day Big Mac test, all right?

756
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,040
 And so here's the deal.

757
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,520
 He's in the wilderness.

758
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,520
 It's 40 days.

759
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,000
 And then the enemy shows up and goes, "Hey, man, are you nuts?

760
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 I know who you are."

761
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,400
 By the way, if you ever wanna see good theology, read what demons say about Jesus.

762
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,480
 "You're the holy one of God who will judge us at the end of time.

763
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,800
 I know who you are."

764
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,920
 Because they live in the spirit realm.

765
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,880
 They see what we don't see.

766
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,960
 They say, "He walks up to you, 'I know who you are, bro.

767
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,680
 You're part of the Trinity.

768
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,880
 You're the one that volunteered to come down here on this mission to redeem the world.

769
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,000
 And your father said he'd watch over you.

770
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,480
 He'd watch over you.

771
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,000
 And the spirit said he would guide you.

772
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,680
 He guided you, bro, right in the wilderness for 40 days."

773
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,560
 How's the ambrosia of the gods working out for you here?

774
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,720
 Let me tell you what's going on.

775
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,000
 Your daddy is up there partying, eating your portion of the eternal meal, and he's forgotten

776
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,060
 all about you.

777
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,280
 So what you need to do, bro, is you need to seize this life by the horns.

778
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,560
 In other words, break the terms of the incarnation.

779
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,640
 Don't live as Todd Wagner has to live as a finite man.

780
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,320
 Even though he was still fully God, he had the ability in a second to do what he wanted.

781
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,480
 And by the way, if he'd have said, "Why don't you take that stone right there, 40-day hungry

782
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,360
 boy, and turn it to bread?"

783
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
 What do you think Jesus would have done?

784
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,360
 "You know what?

785
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
 I'm a little hungry.

786
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,360
 You know what?

787
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,360
 It makes sense to me that God didn't care about you.

788
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,360
 It hasn't been a long time since I've eaten."

789
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:30,440
 Well, what did Jesus do?

790
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,020
 What Jesus did that moment is what we've got to do.

791
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,960
 He had to keep reminding himself of things that were true.

792
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,760
 And so he said, "Man's not going to live by bread alone.

793
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,960
 He's not going to live by sex alone.

794
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,440
 He's not going to live by barbiturates alone.

795
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,640
 He's not going to live by career alone.

796
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,580
 He's not going to live by relationships alone."

797
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:47,280
 But by every word that's true of the awesome God, that's what he did.

798
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,280
 He said, "I'm going to trust in the awesome God."

799
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,960
 And it says as soon as he did that, at that moment, and the reason God let him go through

800
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,300
 that is so that we would know in Hebrews chapter 4 that we've got a high priest who gets at

801
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,300
 man.

802
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,300
 He knows how hard it is to be chaste.

803
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,880
 He knows how hard it is to be faithful, but he's showing you it's worth it.

804
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,880
 It's good.

805
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,440
 It says at that point, the spirit of God came, ministered to him.

806
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,920
 The how long this was in that moment and God's sovereignty was over.

807
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,760
 And that's why, you know, this is what it says in 2 Corinthians chapter 10.

808
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,240
 It says, "For though we walk in the flesh, we don't war according to the flesh.

809
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,760
 For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but they're divinely powerful for

810
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,720
 the destruction of fortresses.

811
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,640
 We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing lifted up against the cause, the knowledge

812
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,400
 of God, and we're taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ."

813
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,920
 You want to not be despairing and anxious?

814
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,600
 That's what you got to do.

815
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,400
 You got to go because look it, remember what I told you?

816
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
 Here's Jesus over here.

817
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
 Hey man, God's forgotten you.

818
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,200
 If God loved you, he would make you not eat.

819
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
 How about this?

820
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,600
 Hey man, I know God lets you eat anything you want, but if he really loved you, he'd

821
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,440
 let you eat this.

822
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,720
 God's not good and you could eat this.

823
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,440
 And by the way, God isn't good and his word's not that true.

824
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,720
 You could eat this and you won't die and disobeying God's not that big a deal.

825
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,320
 Those were the three lies that he gave Adam.

826
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,840
 God isn't good, his word can't be trusted, disobeying him's not that big a deal.

827
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,320
 You go read Matthew 4, it's exactly what Jesus has put through.

828
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,280
 The lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the boastful pride of life, and

829
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,760
 he said, "God can't be true.

830
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,760
 God's not good.

831
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,760
 God's forgotten you.

832
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,760
 Disobeying him won't be that big a deal.

833
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,320
 I can give you everything he gives you."

834
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:30,360
 And every time you cave in, you're buying those same three lies.

835
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,120
 And guess what happens when you buy them?

836
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,640
 You don't get the peace that sin promised you, ever.

837
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,640
 Oh man, you have some moments of ecstasy, but you wake up, there you are again, naked

838
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,080
 and ashamed.

839
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,360
 There's the solution.

840
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,520
 Don't tell anybody you're pregnant.

841
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,280
 We can take you over here and we won't call it your child.

842
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,400
 We'll call it a mass of cells and we'll deal with it and no one ever has to know.

843
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,920
 How'd that work out?

844
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,640
 I could go on and on.

845
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,960
 And here's what I'm telling you as a dad, I'm not mad at you.

846
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,520
 Your father in heaven's not mad at you, he just goes, "Oh, I know that doesn't work.

847
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,840
 That was not the right solution."

848
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:17,280
 And not only are you fearful of who you are, you're fearful that someone will figure out

849
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,280
 what you did.

850
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,280
 I'm not fearful.

851
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,280
 I know what you did.

852
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,280
 I know what I've got for you.

853
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,280
 Come here.

854
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,280
 Come here, baby.

855
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,280
 Come here.

856
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:32,840
 You know, let me just say this about Jesus.

857
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:38,280
 It can be argued, gang, that the only one who really understands fully the extent of

858
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,280
 what temptation is, is the one who fully resists it.

859
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,440
 In other words, we don't even know what Jesus went through because we all at some point

860
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,560
 against that irresistible force of believing God's not good, we relented and so temptation

861
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,560
 stopped.

862
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,560
 But Jesus never stopped.

863
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,240
 And so I think he's the only one that really understands the force of temptation.

864
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,680
 He has been tempted, not in every way as we have been without sin, he's been tempted in

865
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,360
 ways that none of us have even allowed ourselves to be tempted because we eventually, most

866
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,720
 of us, don't take the way of escape that God provided with it and we just go, and guess

867
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,720
 what it leads to?

868
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,720
 Despair and anxiety.

869
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,760
 And God's there saying, "I mean, come here, I love you.

870
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,760
 I'm not even mad at you.

871
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,080
 I mean, what you're experiencing isn't my judgment.

872
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,120
 What you're experiencing is the consequence of what I told you you would get if you did

873
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,120
 that."

874
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,360
 Do you understand that?

875
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,320
 And then I gotta let you know this.

876
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:35,200
 Sometimes things are just happening and it has nothing to do with your sin.

877
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,120
 You just live in a world, gang, you just need to know this.

878
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:43,240
 The Bible says you live in a world with sin in it and so sometimes, sometimes things aren't

879
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,040
 gonna work the way that you want them to work.

880
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,800
 And that shouldn't freak you out.

881
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,800
 Just trust me.

882
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,860
 And here's what I would tell you about God.

883
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:53,860
 And I close with this.

884
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,640
 What you should learn about God is that he really kind of works backwards.

885
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,960
 You would think that the longer you're faithful to God, the better things would go for you

886
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,480
 but what I just need to let you know, that's almost the opposite of what happens.

887
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,100
 Did you hear what I just said?

888
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,240
 The longer that you know that God is good, sometimes the more he lets you live as a testimony

889
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:22,400
 to others that this world is not your home and that he is awesome still.

890
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:29,440
 I'll read you one more time from this amazing man that, ask God how long.

891
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,680
 He said this, "God treats new Christians with a special kind of tenderness.

892
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,360
 Much as a parent dotes on a newborn."

893
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,120
 He quotes this other guy who is a new believer, or a very experienced believer rather and

894
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,560
 he says, "I've seen many striking answers to prayer and more than once I've thought

895
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:52,040
 they were miraculous but they usually come at the beginning of or before even conversion.

896
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,480
 As the Christian life proceeds, they tend to be rarer and rarer.

897
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,880
 The refusals too are not only more frequent, they become more unmistakable, more emphatic."

898
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,880
 Remember Paul?

899
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,320
 Happened to write most of the New Testament.

900
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,200
 Three times I asked God to remove this thorn from me.

901
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,960
 The guy that raised people from the dead, healed people.

902
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,880
 God, just take this thorn from me.

903
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,880
 It never went away.

904
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,880
 C.S. Lewis wrote mere Christianity.

905
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:21,720
 God, I've waited 50 years to marry and now I'll heal my wife.

906
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,400
 No satellite.

907
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,440
 At first glance, such a suggestion seemed to have it all backwards.

908
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,560
 Shouldn't faith become easier, not harder as Christians progress?

909
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:36,720
 But as C.S. Lewis points out, the New Testament gives two strong examples just to the opposite,

910
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,960
 Paul and Jesus.

911
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,360
 Does God then forsake just those who serve him best?

912
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:48,200
 Well, he who served him best of all said near his tortured death, "Why hast thou forsaken

913
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,800
 me?"

914
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,800
 When God became man, that man of all others is least comforted by God.

915
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,880
 At his greatest need, there is a mystery here which even if I had the power, I might not

916
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,600
 have the courage to explore.

917
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,480
 Meanwhile, little people like you and me, if our prayers are sometimes granted beyond

918
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,160
 all hope and probability, had better not draw hasty conclusions to our own advantage.

919
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,880
 The truth is, if we were stronger, we might be less tenderly treated.

920
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,080
 If we were braver, we might be sent with far less help to defend a far more desperate post

921
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:23,920
 in a far greater battle.

922
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,480
 So here's where I close.

923
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,160
 Sometimes gang, when you're waiting for God to answer, don't get anxious.

924
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:36,760
 Just remind yourself, "Okay, this one's going to cook a long time it looks like, but I know

925
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,760
 God's good."

926
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,640
 And the way you know God is good is because you can take the most awful moment in human

927
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,840
 history.

928
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:51,160
 When the kindest one who ever lived, to this day, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Christians,

929
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,680
 even atheists go, "Yeah, Jesus, we have no problem with Jesus."

930
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,800
 The best man who ever lived, there was a moment when he said, "No one's going to take my life,

931
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,800
 but I'm going to lay it down."

932
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,520
 In fact, the guy who just identified him as the Son of God, the Christ, when he said that,

933
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,520
 said, "No, you're not.

934
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,520
 I'm going to stop that.

935
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,400
 I know who you are, you're God in the flesh, but that's a bad plan, Jesus.

936
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,760
 You are not going to die."

937
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,920
 If I had been there, if we had voted, if we took a poll, our hero Jesus that we've been

938
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,720
 walking with is going to go to a cross, what do you think?

939
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,600
 We go, "No, not him.

940
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,800
 Give us anybody but him.

941
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,800
 Let him live.

942
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,120
 It's got to be good for him to live."

943
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,120
 Guess what?

944
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,480
 God said, "No, get behind me."

945
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,520
 That's the thinking of Satan, that it's always ease.

946
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,120
 What God's going to do is show you love.

947
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,120
 He's going to show you grace and he's going to show you mercy.

948
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,640
 If I had been asked what to do in that moment, I would have said, "You cannot go to that

949
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,240
 cross."

950
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,240
 I would have stopped the very thing that led to my great salvation.

951
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,960
 Jesus did go to a cross.

952
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,640
 I guarantee you, on Friday night, I'd have been filled with anxiety, even though he had

953
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,120
 told me that he had this thing in control and that no one was going to take his life.

954
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,000
 He was going to lay it down and take it back up again.

955
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,520
 I guarantee you, Saturday morning, it'd have been tough.

956
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,640
 If I had a godly friend, they would have said, "Todd, he told you three days."

957
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,240
 I guarantee you, Saturday afternoon, I wouldn't have eaten.

958
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,680
 Saturday night, it'd have been really long.

959
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,320
 Sunday morning, I wouldn't even have the courage to go see if my hopes were true.

960
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:14,920
 I'd have sent the women.

961
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,120
 I mean, if you can take that moment, you can just keep going back.

962
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,400
 God, all I know is in the greatest moment of evil in the history of the world, that

963
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,920
 turned out to be the greatest moment of good.

964
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,080
 That's all I need.

965
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,160
 He tells us that our three days might be this entire life.

966
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,440
 You might be in that wheelchair your entire life.

967
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,440
 It's a lie, girls.

968
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,440
 Let me just tell you this.

969
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,640
 It's a lie if you love God and you're in a good community group and you seek after him,

970
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,440
 that God will eventually bring you a godly man.

971
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,720
 I don't know if that's true.

972
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,280
 You need to quit making that your hope.

973
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,520
 Make your hope in God alone because here's the deal, man.

974
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,320
 The most wonderful man in the world is going to bring you pain.

975
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,440
 There's one promise in the Bible to marriage.

976
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,400
 Do you know what it is?

977
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,760
 Such will have trouble.

978
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,320
 Now, look, there's a lot of blessing that comes from that trouble.

979
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:13,600
 I'm a big fan of marriage, but marriage is a lousy God.

980
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,720
 Quit waiting for it.

981
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,520
 You should be anxious about one thing, that you today would be indifferent in your love

982
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,240
 and pursuit of Jesus Christ.

983
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,600
 Because in your marriage, you're eventually going to have to find your satisfaction in

984
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,360
 him because that person in some way is not going to be what you want them to be, but

985
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,640
 Jesus will be and he'll allow you out of the overflow of gratitude in your heart to love

986
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,640
 them.

987
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,240
 You see, here's the thing.

988
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,120
 What God wants you to do is to have a Christ-like faith, not just a child-like faith.

989
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,120
 A child-like faith is beautiful.

990
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,200
 A child-like faith is the Lord is my shepherd.

991
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,200
 I shall not want.

992
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,200
 He's a good God.

993
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,200
 I love God.

994
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,280
 A child-like faith is one who says, "God's always good.

995
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,840
 He makes me lie down in green pastures.

996
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,840
 God's always good.

997
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
 He leads me beside quiet waters.

998
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,840
 Oh, God's always good.

999
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,840
 He restores my soul.

1000
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,840
 Oh, God's always good.

1001
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,240
 He guides me in the paths of righteousness.

1002
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,240
 I've got a good daddy.

1003
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,240
 I love my daddy."

1004
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,240
 Right?

1005
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,480
 That's a child-like faith and there's nothing wrong with it.

1006
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,480
 But I want to tell you something.

1007
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,720
 Sometimes you got to go, "It's been a long time since I've been in a green pasture.

1008
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,920
 I'm really thirsty."

1009
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,920
 This is a Christ-like faith.

1010
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,920
 Are you ready?

1011
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,920
 This is Psalm 22.

1012
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:20,600
 "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

1013
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,840
 Far from deliverance are the words of my groaning.

1014
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,840
 Oh, my God.

1015
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:29,360
 I cry by day, but you don't answer and by night, but I have no rest.

1016
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,360
 You are holy.

1017
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,360
 I know you're holy.

1018
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,360
 I know you're good.

1019
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,360
 I know your word's true.

1020
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,280
 I know that disobeying you is a big deal, but I'm on a cross and this is hard."

1021
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,960
 And if you keep reading, you find out that he keeps telling God the truth, but he waits

1022
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,200
 and he doesn't use his divinity to get himself down off that cross and make it easy.

1023
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:52,120
 He waits there all the way until that last breath heeds and he says, "It is finished,"

1024
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,680
 so that you could know that God is good.

1025
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,000
 See, he's not upset when you say, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

1026
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,880
 But you remember, he's never forsaken you.

1027
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,040
 It looks like he's forsaken you, but he's never forsaken you.

1028
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,800
 And the more you know him, the more sometimes he lets you go through serious seasons of

1029
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,120
 hunger and of thirst.

1030
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,480
 And you know what he says?

1031
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,480
 "That's my boy.

1032
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,480
 You watch him.

1033
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,480
 That's my boy.

1034
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,480
 You know him.

1035
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,480
 He is steadfast.

1036
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,480
 He is ready.

1037
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,480
 He is righteous.

1038
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,480
 He is blameless.

1039
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,480
 He fears God.

1040
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,480
 He shuns evil.

1041
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,480
 That's my boy.

1042
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,480
 That's faith.

1043
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,420
 That's somebody who knows what I look like."

1044
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,380
 He won't cave.

1045
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:35,360
 He's not waiting if he's not married by 30, he's going to plug this thing in.

1046
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,560
 No, that dude is with me to the end.

1047
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,560
 That's my boy.

1048
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,760
 And that's a Christlike faith.

1049
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,280
 And I'm not promising you, if you're here and you see God, it's going to get easy.

1050
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,760
 I'm promising you it might get hard for a while and he will not forsake you and you

1051
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,360
 will be glad on that day and you've got no anxiety.

1052
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,860
 You've got nothing but a future and a hope and you will hear, "Well done."

1053
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:02,120
 And I got the rest of eternity to convince you that you were right.

1054
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,200
 Father, I pray that this group would believe it.

1055
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,680
 I pray that this room would come to know you and that their hope and their peace would

1056
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:16,080
 be, Father, in the CV of Jesus' life.

1057
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,680
 That they would understand that you don't forsake them.

1058
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,680
 It feels like it.

1059
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,000
 I thank you, Father, that we in our own and our journal and our crosses, we can yell,

1060
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,720
 "Man, God, why does it feel so much like you've forsaken me?"

1061
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:32,360
 But at the end, you are in heaven and we are on earth, so let our words be few and let

1062
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:38,120
 us trust in you, the God who makes no mistakes.

1063
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,240
 You've never had to apologize.

1064
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,600
 You've never had to go, "I wish I had a do-over."

1065
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,120
 And Father, we know as long as we seek first your kingdom and your righteousness, we will

1066
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,760
 say the same thing.

1067
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:58,920
 Thank you, Lord, that you're not bothered, that sometimes temptation looks really real

1068
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,040
 good to us.

1069
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,720
 You know exactly what that feels like.

1070
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,440
 I thank you that you haven't left us here alone.

1071
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,560
 You've given us your spirit and your word to remind us what is true, and you've even

1072
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,680
 given us your people, other people who can run with us and keep reminding us.

1073
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,320
 I know it looks like he's forgotten you, but he hasn't.

1074
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,320
 Don't you believe it?

1075
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:21,280
 If the cross is the curse of disease at a young age, don't you curse him.

1076
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,720
 You use every year of your dying to be faithful to him.

1077
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:31,520
 You sing his praises all the way to the end, because this life is not all there is.

1078
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,240
 And so Lord, even in the face of death, we fear not.

1079
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:41,560
 Because at the end we come back to that little childlike faith and we say, "You're my God,

1080
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,120
 and you're a good shepherd.

1081
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,840
 I will trust in you and I will sing your praises."

1082
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,840
 So Father, in our thirsting for quick satisfaction in the world, may we quickly turn it to your

1083
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,680
 word which says, "Thirst for me.

1084
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,320
 Thirst for me, for you are the one that satisfies."

1085
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,320
 We are thirsty, Lord.

1086
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,960
 We pray just like you taught us to pray, that you'd come quickly.

1087
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,120
 But until you come, help us to be faithful.

1088
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:15,880
 Use an increasing number of godly men in this room to encourage others to wait with me.

1089
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,880
 Help me wait.

1090
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,680
 Help me remember that you are good.

1091
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,560
 For your glory, that I might be free from despair.

1092
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,560
 That the world might know that you're a God worth singing of, in Jesus' name.

1093
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:25,560
 Amen.

1094
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,560
