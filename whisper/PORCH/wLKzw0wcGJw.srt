 [Music]

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 All right, well, we're continuing this series, but I wanted to start by just addressing

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 clearly everything going on. And I hate that what I'm about to do is going to fall so short

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 of communicating and expressing how tremendously grieved, hurting, sad, confused, shocked,

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 and just really heartbroken over not just the death of George Floyd, but the pain that

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 is rippling through so many people, but especially inside the church, and our black and brown

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 brothers and sisters in Christ. I have been sick all day and this weekend thinking about

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 and praying about and fasting about how to use just the moments we have here tonight.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And I want you to know that we are standing with you, that we are praying with you, and

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 that I see you as more family and more blood than members of my own family who don't know

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Jesus. There's a saying that blood is thicker than water, which means just family runs deeper

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 than friendships. And while blood is thicker than water, the cross is thicker and stronger

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 than them both. And you are our brothers and our sisters, and we mourn and are just really

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 grieved alongside of you, and are listening. And when you hurt, we are hurting with you

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 and are so grateful that we get to be in a family that has all of the different spectrums

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 of ethnicity and race. And you matter, and all the pain that you're feeling, we are heartbroken

17
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 over. So let me pray, and we'll dive in. Father, I do thank you that because of the cross of

18
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Christ, every person, red, yellow, black, and white, who trusts in you is connected

19
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 and bonded and sealed and kindred spirits for all of eternity because they have the

20
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Holy Spirit. I pray that you would continue to eradicate and expose and remove injustice,

21
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 racism, police brutality, and all kinds of evil from our land. Would you help us as the

22
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 church to cling to you, to love one another, and to look like you did when you walked this

23
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 earth? So help us, God. Would you fill in gaps just with your grace, even on... I know

24
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 there are no words and no things that can be said that in a message can heal so much

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 of the pain that's being felt. But you can. So help us. In Christ's name, amen.

26
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Well, if you're listening and joining us online, there's a handful of friends and volunteers

27
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 that are here. And I thought I'd start by asking just a question, or give us some direction

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 for where we're going tonight. If there was one sin that you could remove from the

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 earth, what would it be? One that you are most angry, opposed to... What would you say?

30
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 What would you say? Yeah. Pride. Pride. What would you say? Lust. Lust. Murder. Murder.

31
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Other ones? Rape. Prejudice. Abuse. Hatred. Jealousy. Jealousy. That's a great Winster

32
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 move. I think if you look at Scripture and you ask that question, which sin is God most

33
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 opposed to, there's one that over and over and over he seems to highlight, and it is

34
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 the sin of pride. He says in Proverbs 8, chapter 8, verse 13, "I hate pride and arrogance,

35
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 evil behavior and perverse speech." He says in Isaiah chapter 57, verse 15, "The high

36
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 and lofty one, God, who lives in eternity, the Holy One, says this, 'I live in a high

37
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 and holy place, and with those whose spirits are humble, are contrite and humble.'" He

38
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 says, "Hey, I dwell not only in eternity and heavens of heavens and the highest place,

39
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 but also only with the humble." Over and over and over the Scriptures say God is opposed

40
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 to the proud. He gives grace to the humble. The image is like, hey, you're in a boxing

41
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 ring. You got you over here if you're proud, and God over here. And that's how he feels

42
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 towards pride. What's crazy about pride is honestly it's one of the more acceptable sins,

43
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I think, in most of our lives or in my life. Like if I was up here and I was like, hey,

44
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I've just been struggling with any of the ones or a lot of the ones that you just named.

45
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Like, hey, I've been struggling with abuse, or I've been struggling with, you know, having

46
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 sex outside of marriage with someone other than my wife. Most of you would be like, dude,

47
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 what? You just lost the right to talk up here. But if I was to say, man, I've been struggling

48
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 with pride, most of us would be like, who isn't, right? Like it's one of the more acceptable

49
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 ones that we feel or we're almost so accustomed to. And yet when you read the Bible over and

50
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 over and over, God is so clear. I am opposed to pride. Partially because so many of the

51
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 other sins we're going to talk about in this series of seven deadly sins, which is a funny

52
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 title because every sin is by definition deadly. The wages of sin is death, the Bible says.

53
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But we're just grabbing these huge pillars of sins that our generation can wrestle with

54
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 and tonight on pride. And one of the reasons God is opposed to it is because as many theologians

55
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 have said for a long time, you can trace the root of so many other sins back to pride.

56
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 C.S. Lewis put it this way, sexual sin, anger, greed, drunkenness, etc. are all nothing in

57
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 comparison to pride. It was through pride that the devil became the devil. In other

58
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 words, Satan was cast out of heaven because he wanted to be God, which was pride. Pride

59
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 leads to every other sin. It is the complete anti-God state of mind. God hates pride because

60
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 it kills relationships and pride will keep you out of heaven because it will not allow

61
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 you to say, I need a savior. The challenge of a message like this, let you into the preaching

62
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 world, is pride is a weird topic because people who are proud are not going to listen to a

63
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 message on pride because they don't think they need it. So it's a frustrating thing

64
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 because the people who actually need to hear it are the ones that are least likely to.

65
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And so if you're listening right now and you're going, oh man, pride, that really doesn't

66
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 apply to me. I'm not really a prideful person. You are exactly the person I'm talking about.

67
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And pride, to any degree that it creeps into our life, is always toxic and poisonous,

68
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 especially to relationships. What we're about to discuss, if the church will do, it won't

69
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 overnight heal every problem that's taking place. It won't overnight remove and eradicate

70
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 racism, but it will move the church in the direction of unifying together and bringing

71
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 healing into our world, what we're about to talk about for the next 25 minutes. So I just

72
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 want to walk through Philippians chapter 2, where Paul talks about pride and humility.

73
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I'm going to incorporate some other scriptures that will inform it, but I just want to talk

74
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 about how pride presents, what it looks like, what pride prevents in our life, and then

75
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 where pride ends. So if you're taking notes, those are the three ideas I just want to talk

76
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 through from Philippians chapter 2. Philippians, Paul wrote to the church in Philippi, this

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 letter that he wrote from a jail cell. Today we call it Philippians, or the letter of Philippians.

78
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And here's what he says in verse 3 of chapter 2. "Don't be selfish. Don't try to impress

79
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 other people. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourself. Don't look out only

80
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 for your own interests, but take an interest or look out for the interests of others."

81
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 As we launch into a conversation about pride and humility, one of the challenges is that

82
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 pride masquerades or wears different faces when it surfaces in our life. Like pride inside

83
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 of all of our lives looks different in different ways. It can come up and pop up, and it's

84
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 not always overtly, like sometimes it's easy to spot the guy who's like overly cocky, he's

85
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 still talking about his high school football days and how great he was, and just he's all

86
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 about himself. That person, it's clear, like man, that guy's arrogant, he struggles with

87
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 pride. But pride, this obsession with self and self-focus, which is what pride is, can

88
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 pop up in a lot of different ways. It can pop up as self-love, but it also pops up as

89
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 self-hate, because at the center of your thoughts and your focus and all of those is still self.

90
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Both of those can be pride. Pride can pop up as insecurity, where I'm afraid to talk

91
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 and I'm afraid of what other people think about me, because at the center of your thought

92
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 is still you. I'm constantly looking. Like some people, like there are people who are

93
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 tremendously quiet who struggle with incredible pride, because they're just afraid. There's

94
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 times the Bible commands us to speak, and they're afraid to speak because they're afraid

95
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 of, "Oh no, what are people going to think?" That's pride. It's not always overtly clear

96
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 if somebody's struggling with pride. It can also look like being judgmental towards other

97
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 people, who struggle with sins, sexual attractions, who have challenges or struggles in their

98
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 life that you don't and you look down on, or I look down on them because of it. Pride

99
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 also looks like taking credit for things that you didn't earn, you didn't deserve, that

100
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 everything that you've been given, the Bible says, is all a gift of God's grace in your

101
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 life. Paul in 1 Corinthians 4, verse 7 says this, "What do you have that you did not receive?"

102
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 The way that you look, the mind that you have, the job that you have, the family you were

103
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 born into, the city that you live in, everything, Paul says, is something that's foolish to

104
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 be proud about, because all of it was a gift that you can't take credit for. You're not

105
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 responsible for being born into whatever family you were. And you may be thinking, "No, but

106
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 I work hard at my job." You're not responsible for having the mind that God gave you that

107
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 allowed you to work, for having legs that allow you to get up and move around every

108
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 day. Paul says everything has been a gift from God and it's foolish, and pride looks

109
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 like, "Hey man, I'm taking credit because I worked really hard. I earned this." Pride

110
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 looks like entitlement instead of gratitude. I'm focused on what I don't have that other

111
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 people had. Again, at the center of that is self. Pride looks defensive. "Man, I hate

112
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 this one because I is this one." And that a lot of times in my life, defensiveness can

113
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 pop up where I will dismiss or defend or I don't want to listen. And at the center of

114
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 that is a pridefulness that thinks that I'm right. Pride can look in all these different

115
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 ways instead of like pride can look like shame. And you may be going, "Pride? Shame? Guilt?"

116
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 For a Christian who's trusted in Jesus, pride can look like shame because any time that

117
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 I rehearse that and I just get covered in shame, I am saying that my sin is more powerful

118
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 than the grace of God. Or my sin is more powerful than what Christ did. My actions are more

119
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 powerful than the actions Jesus took on the cross. Pride can pop up in all kinds of forms

120
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 in our life. It can look like being stressed out because I'm so worried and I feel like

121
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 the entire world rests on me, which is a lie. And that's pride. And it still has me at the

122
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 center of it. Pride can look like being easily offended. Like somebody who's prideful is

123
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 often easily offended because, "Hey, you hit self and the most important thing in the universe

124
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 is myself and you offended me." Pride can pop up in lots of different ways. Pride looks

125
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 like unwillingness to apologize until someone else owns their part. I know Josiah's been

126
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 there before and I'm totally kidding. We all have. Pride looks like I'm unable to see anything

127
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 other than the issues and the reasons why I'm justified in not doing something else

128
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 and I don't have to move towards that person. That's pride. Pride, even in this moment for

129
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 me, is more concerned about what you and you think of what I'm going to teach tonight than

130
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 what God thinks about what I'm going to teach tonight. Pride can pop up in lots of different

131
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 ways. One exercise that would be helpful you should consider doing, because pride is a

132
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 little bit like bad breath. If you have it, you can't really tell that you have it, is

133
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 to ask people in your life, "How do you think pride manifests itself in my life?" My guess

134
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 is they're going to have an answer. You probably won't like the answer because you're prideful,

135
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 just like I am. But knowing, "How does pride pop up in my life?" This week I did that practice

136
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 with several different people and asked, "Hey, how do you feel like pride pops up in my life?"

137
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And the answer, multiple times, was, "You have a bent and in default, you think that

138
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 you are right, always. And that makes you less quick to listen and less quick to be

139
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 empathetic. And I hate it. And they're right. And I'm prideful. And there's areas where

140
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I need God to come in and expose and kill. I don't know what areas you have, but you

141
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 need to know, "How does pride pop itself up in my life?" And if you don't think it does,

142
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 you have deceived yourself and you are prideful. And having other believers in your life that

143
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 can help you go, "Hey, this is how pride is going to pop up," or, "This is how I've seen

144
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 it pop up in your life." Ask them that question this week. If they take nothing else away

145
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 from this message, if you just get that, you will be on the step towards not allowing pride

146
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 to kill relationships and kill your faith. Paul, in defining humility, he also gives

147
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 us a look into what pride prevents us from having in our own life. So the second idea

148
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 from this text is just, here's what pride prevents, specifically, relationships. Pride

149
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 is the enemy of relationships. Like Paul is saying, "Hey, in humility, look to other people,

150
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 care and be concerned about the needs of other people. Be less concerned about yourself and

151
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 more concerned about others." And pride comes in and it says, "Don't care about them. You

152
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 need to focus on you. They're all wrong." It begins to turn your focus inward and it

153
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 creates a prison where I begin to lock other people out. I lock God out and myself in,

154
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 where I'm not willing to listen to others. Pride right now looks like a white person

155
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 saying, "I didn't do anything wrong," or, "I didn't do anything racist. Let's move on,"

156
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 without first listening. Pride can look like a black person saying, "Man, this is never

157
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 going to change. I'm over it. I'm done." Both of those things can be anchored in pride.

158
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And anytime pride is present, the enemy or Satan is working and winning and wants to

159
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 take that and drive as deep as he can a wedge and division because he hates relationships

160
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 and pride is the enemy of relationships. It kills them every single time. Pride will prevent

161
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 and shut you out from true greatness in your life because in order to be truly great, Jesus

162
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 said in Mark chapter 10, "That involves you serving other people, not focusing on yourself."

163
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 In Mark chapter 10, verse 43, he said this, "Whoever wants to be great must be your servant."

164
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 He redefines what greatness is. This is what greatness is. This is why pride prevents you

165
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 from ever having true greatness, because you're unwilling to be a servant. "Whoever wants

166
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 to be first must be slave of all, for the Son of Man," that's God, "did not come to be

167
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many." Serving requires humility.

168
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Pride also prevents you from growing. Proverbs chapter 12, verse 15, says, "The way of a

169
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 fool seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice." You know what's interesting about

170
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 that verse? I think everybody thinks, for the most part, what's right to them is right

171
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 to them. Like, most of us are not like, "You know, this is what I believe, but I'm pretty

172
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 sure I'm wrong." Most of us think, "I'm right." The difference in the verse is that one is

173
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 willing to listen to others and receive instruction and one is not. The fool is just saying, "I

174
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 know I'm right. I'll always be right. There's nothing I'm missing here." And the wise person,

175
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 it's not that they don't still think they're right, they're just willing to listen. Pride

176
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 prevents you from growing because it prevents you from listening, from growing, from receiving

177
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 feedback from other people in your life and in your world. And to the degree that you

178
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 are unwilling to listen to others is the degree to which you are not going to grow. Grow in

179
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 your faith, grow in maturity, grow overall. Finally, pride prevents you from a relationship

180
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 with God. Pride prevents you from coming to a place where you say, "Man, I need a Savior.

181
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I don't need just another chance. I'm not a good enough person." It prevents you from

182
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 seeing God as perfect and holy and you not being worthy of it. Jesus, in Matthew chapter

183
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 5, in one of the first words that we're told that he taught people, he said, "Blessed are

184
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 the spiritually poor or the poor in spirit for they will receive or for theirs is the

185
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 kingdom of heaven." What does it mean to be spiritually poor? It means I see myself as

186
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 not worthy, that if I'm going to have a relationship with the God who's there, it's not because

187
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I earned it or I deserve it, it's because God is going to initiate and God has provided

188
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 a way for that to happen. If you can't come and candidly, this is the issue I think that

189
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 sends more people to hell than any other issue. They never arrive at a place where they see

190
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 themselves as, "Look, I'm not a good enough person. I'm not ever going to be deserving

191
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 of a relationship with God. I try to pay my taxes. I try to be nice. I give to the poor

192
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 every once in a while and five bucks to the guy in the corner, but I'm not a good enough

193
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 person." Most people hide behind like, "No, I'm really, at the end of the day, like I'm

194
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 a good person. God, you know, I'm sure he's going to accept good people." The Bible says

195
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 there are no good people and only those who recognize that they bring nothing to the table

196
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 and are willing to accept the free gift that God has given are going to experience eternity

197
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 with God. Pride doesn't just kill relationships here. It will end or keep you out of heaven.

198
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 It's a thing that through Satan, as I mentioned early, and so pride is satanic in many ways.

199
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 As I mentioned earlier, pride also puts you in the opposition of God. Over and over, three

200
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 times in the New Testament, it's the same phrase. It's really interesting. If you're

201
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 God and you're writing, you know, inspiring the writers and over and over, he includes

202
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 this phrase that, "Hey, God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. God opposes

203
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 the proud but gives grace to the humble. God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."

204
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 It's as though he's defining or helping you see what people who God is along with or on

205
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 the same team as and those who he is opposed to or playing in opposition against. "Hey,

206
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 these people who are on my team, they're clothed in humility. Those who are not on my team,

207
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 they're clothed in pride." I mean, think about that. You guys remember when we had sports

208
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 RIP, when that was a thing? You could tell a team by what? You could tell who was on

209
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 the team by the jersey that they were wearing, right? From the biblical perspective, pride

210
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 is the jersey of the opposing team. That God says, "Man, if that is what you're wearing,

211
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 you are in opposition to me." Anytime that is the attitude or the posture or the way

212
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 that you are operating, you and I place ourself in the opposition of the thing that God wants

213
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 to bless and that God does bless. God hates pride because it kills relationships and it

214
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 kills people's ability to have a relationship with him. Pride is the thing that is killing

215
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 our country right now. Pride was the original sin that was introduced when white superiority

216
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 and white pride was introduced, that there could be inferior races. Pride continues to

217
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 plague and be a part of dismantling and dividing and creating division and unwillingness to

218
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 come together and say, "Man, I want to listen and I want to listen to you and I want to

219
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 hear." And both sides doing that will continue to perpetuate division and it is killing our

220
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 country. This obsessiveness of self is killing just society and it will kill our faith and

221
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 it will kill relationships. Do you guys know how many selfies a day are taken in the world?

222
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Take a guess. A million. Not a bad guess. Two million? Hundred million? Close. 93 million.

223
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 That is what I read this week. 93 million selfies. The selfie apparently came on the

224
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 scene in like 2011 and who knows if before that people were turning around a Kodiak camera

225
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 that they wind up and take it. But at least then with smart phone and all those things

226
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 that terminology kind of got launched on the scene and since then people have been taking

227
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 selfies. It is kind of a picture really of how society has only further moved more and

228
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 more towards a focus on self. Do you guys know there is something called selfie, death

229
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 by selfie? And it is pretty tragic honestly. Death by selfie is what they would term the

230
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 hundreds of people who in effort to get the best selfie possible ended up dying because

231
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 they fell off some cliff in Machu Picchu or they got attacked by a walrus that actually

232
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 happened or they fell off some cliff. In order to get the best possible picture of themselves

233
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 and the place that they were at they ended up losing their life. But through a selfie

234
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 and self-focus it cost them their life and it is costing the self-focused pride. Anytime

235
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 it enters any of our hearts it will cost you relationships, it will cost you future marriage,

236
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 it will cost you your life and your eternal life if you are not willing to through humility

237
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 accept you are unworthy and undeserving of a relationship with God and it is killing

238
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 and will kill our country but it doesn't have to. And Paul says humility should mark the

239
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 people of God which brings us to our third point which is where pride ends. He lays out

240
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 what humility is and then he says this, "You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus

241
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 had or the same mindset. Though he was God he did not think equality with God as something

242
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 to cling to. Instead he gave up his divine privileges, he took the humble position of

243
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 a slave, was born as a human being. When he appeared in human form he humbled himself

244
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 in obedience to God and died a criminal's death on the cross." Paul lays out and gives

245
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 us the greatest picture of humility that there could ever be and he says Jesus not only had

246
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 a mindset of humility it led him to actions and moved him to act in humility by humbling

247
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 himself to such a great extent that I'm confident no illustration I could possibly give would

248
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 put into words what it just said. The passage just said though he was God period anything

249
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 that it follows up with after that. That doesn't include he decided to destroy anybody who

250
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 opposed him or he decided you know I'm just going to start this whole universe over or

251
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I'm going to make up some anything that would involve him saying I'm going to go to the

252
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 world I created to become like one of the humans that I created and to die in the place

253
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 of all people everywhere and for all people everywhere. The analogy has been used that

254
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 it would be like you know if you had an ant farm and you were like man I want to save

255
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 this ant farm and so you decided because you were God you could become an ant you became

256
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 an ant and then the ant farm rallied around it was like get rid of him and they decided

257
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 to crucify and kill you. But even now it would fall incredibly short of the eternal perfect

258
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 holy God who came to this earth reflected perfection did nothing wrong was completely

259
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 wronged though he was completely right himself and yet he made the move and sought to reconcile

260
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 to such a length that it wasn't just you know he said he initiated the apology conversation

261
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 he was willing to move to such a degree that even if it cost him being crucified for people

262
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 who didn't respect him who didn't want him who didn't care about him he was willing to

263
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 do it. And Paul instructs that as a church what should Marcus is the mindset and the

264
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 movements of humility. It's been said that humility is not thinking less of yourself

265
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 it's thinking about others more or thinking about yourself less. It's moving towards people

266
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 in the conversation. It's moving towards and owning your part even before they've ever

267
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 said they're sorry. Humility is a thing that allows you to do things like this some of

268
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 you may have seen pictures of police officers and people protesting. Here's another one.

269
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 You can't have that without humility. Here's another one or the last one. That's something

270
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 that doesn't take place unless one person is willing to say hey I'm not here to you

271
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 know choose sides or decide who's wrong or who's right I'm here to move towards unity

272
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 and healing and coming together and you cannot do that without humility. Peter says in 1

273
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Peter chapter 5 all of you clothe yourself with humility towards one another because

274
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 God opposes the proud but he shows favor to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under

275
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 God's mighty hand that he may lift you up in due time. He says the analogy of wearing

276
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 humility continually it's like clothes that you wear just like you get up and every day

277
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 you put on clothes to go to your job you never would go to your job without wearing clothes.

278
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Peter says that's the way you're to think about humility which makes sense because the

279
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 moment that humility is something that I'm like oh man I feel like I'm being humble right

280
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 now five minutes later I'm angry I'm defensive I'm dismissive I'm prideful and he says you've

281
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 got to constantly be putting this thing on like something that you wear. What's further

282
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 interesting is humility is one of those things that man it just looks good on everybody like

283
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 unlike pride that looks good on nobody like the guy who's like I want to talk about me

284
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 myself and I and let me tell you how great I am that guy is repulsive or that girl is

285
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 repulsive am I right like if you're listening and you want to be more attractive overnight

286
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 I'm about to give you the key if you were hit by the ugly stick when you were born this

287
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 will make you more attractive by the time this message is over just be humble. Am I

288
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 wrong ladies? Am I right? Like the guy who's like hey I'm going to take credit I'm going

289
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 to give credit I'm going to serve I care about you they're going out of their way and they're

290
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 like I'm so sorry was that was that over the line you're like why are you even apologizing

291
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 right now and they are overly humble it's unbelievably attractive and the same thing

292
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 is how unattractive pride is in our lives it's at the same time not always very comfortable

293
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 to put on humility in other words it's like this thing that is so attractive when you

294
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 wear it but it's also uncomfortable you know kind of when you wear it because I think sometimes

295
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 we think like oh you know when I'm humble it'll feel comfortable I don't think it feels

296
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 comfortable all the time I think there's times where I have to be like look I don't want

297
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 to move forward in this conversation and own my part but that's because I'm prideful so

298
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 I'm making the decision I'm pushing through it I'm not letting pride own me I'm going

299
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 to decide hey will you please forgive me I'm going to make the phone call I'm going to

300
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 initiate and take the first step it's not always comfortable but it's the thing that

301
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 I'm supposed to wear it's like anything that our ladies probably can relate to there's

302
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 items of clothing that you're like yeah hey it's not the most comfortable but it's my

303
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 favorite item I feel like I like how I look the best in it this is just a dangerous ground

304
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 that I'm walking on right now but it's like that it's that item that it's not always comfortable

305
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 it's always attractive and it's always the thing that brings healing and allows relationships

306
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 to flourish and Peter says and the Bible affirms it's something that you and I are to put on

307
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 every single day I have a friend who thinks of just his day in the morning and he begins

308
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 to think through all the different ways he needs to put on humility as he anticipates

309
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 I'm going to go in that meeting I'm going to be tempted to be prideful or defensive

310
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 or angry or hurt or and I need to put on humility I want to think through the lens of the other

311
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 person I want to think through how to care for them and he says he goes through and every

312
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 single day he begins starts his day part of it by thinking through how do I put on humility

313
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 and everything that I'm going to face and experience today what does that look like

314
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 and Peter says every day you wake up you put it on you put it on the two ways that scripture

315
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 just pointed out is humility towards God and towards other people humility towards God

316
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 and then I trust God's timing hunter humble yourselves under God's mighty hand that he

317
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 will lift you up in due time I trust his timing over the circumstances and the story he's

318
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 writing in my life I trust his timing over when I'm going to get married I trust his

319
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 timing over the opportunities or lack of opportunities that I have at work I trust God in the midst

320
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 of all of it I'm humbling myself and trusting he's sovereign over everything that I'm experiencing

321
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 facing I trust him and then it's also acting towards others and serving other people it's

322
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 seeking to serve it's being humble towards other people seeking to be quick to listen

323
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 and put on humility through my actions I don't know what Jesus would call you in your life

324
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 right now to do in terms of humble but I know that that mindset is supposed to lead to actions

325
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 and all of us so some of us may need to leave this message and you got to go pick up the

326
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 phone you got to make a phone call whatever link he would call you to I know it's not

327
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 as far as he went by humbling himself to such a point that he would even die a criminal's

328
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 death on a cross I don't know where pride manifests itself in your life and I don't

329
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 know where you need to move in through the uncomfortable action of humility but to all

330
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 of us Jesus says this is the thing that brings healing and no one is being asked to go anywhere

331
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 or to any place that is farther than the links that I went for you for me humility really

332
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 is like habits like these humble habits and so as we kind of wrap up here's what I really

333
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 I hope you leave here I hope you hear me I want you to pick a fight with your pride I

334
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 want you to pick a fight and say hey I'm not going to let you control my life anymore like

335
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 you don't get to control my relationships anymore pride you for the last 22 years you

336
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 have decided whether or not I'm going to keep being friends with somebody because once I

337
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 get hurt I'm out of there once I accidentally hurt somebody I'm like oh they're so offended

338
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 so easily so I'm out of here we're not even friends anymore how long are you going to

339
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 live that way how long are you going to let pride decide and determine your relationships

340
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 how long are you going to let pride not allow you to have a relationship with your sister

341
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 or your parent or your old roommate or that friend how long are you going to hide behind

342
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 your pride and blame other people or point the finger be unwilling to own your part whatever

343
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 it is in whatever conflict there is how long I just want you to answer honestly to yourself

344
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 I think I'm going to do it for the rest of my life just own it just say it just live

345
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 in that and embrace it but for the rest of us the scripture clearly calls us hey I want

346
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 you to pick a fight with your pride it doesn't have to control you and the way that you decide

347
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 it's not controlling me is by pushing through even when it's uncomfortable I'm not going

348
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 to allow my feelings my pride to determine my life tragically most people never do that

349
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 and they go through and that's why our world is so dysfunctional so world runs on pride

350
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 a world loves pride feeds pride and there's nothing God hates more because it's killing

351
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 people and it's killing relationships and he says for the church it shouldn't be this

352
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 way conclusion how does pride manifest itself in your life what is pride preventing you

353
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 from like what relationships are now and how would God how would Jesus like if he if somebody

354
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 was going to sit down with you and be like hey Jesus called all of us to follow him with

355
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 our lives how would he begin to say hey I want you to follow me and act like I act and

356
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 be humble even when other people are not it's a really painful really uncomfortable experience

357
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 but it's one that as believers we've been invited to and when we do it brings healing

358
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 to the church and this is something man I don't know if it discourages or encourages

359
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 people who are listening I am prideful we do something called regeneration here at watermark

360
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 it's like a recovery thing and one of the three things that I entered into it was because

361
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 I have pride in my life and I hate it and it's through deciding and moving towards people

362
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 and not having to be right which is not always easy or being okay with not getting the last

363
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 word in or being okay with those things when those are marking my life typically it means

364
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 that I'm doing better with the battle of pride what's tragically happened and I'll close

365
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 here our world is so fed this narrative to put you in the middle like you're the focus

366
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 I'm the focus of life and I'm the sinner and I should be the sinner and life is about me

367
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 and anyone who hurt me or anything that happened to me I need to focus on me focus on me me

368
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 me me me and life is not found there it's depressing narcissism leads to anxiety narcissism

369
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 like the obsession and focus of like the world revolves around me it leads to me cutting

370
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 off relationships it comes naturally but it leads to a place where I'm all alone I'm cut

371
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 off from God my intimacy with other friends or intimacy with God it cuts me off from my

372
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 wife and anytime that I buy the lie that hey man life is about you or you buy the lie that

373
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 life is about you you lose there was a astronomer in the 1500s named Nicholas Copernicus you

374
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 guys know who that is?

375
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Anybody hear of him?

376
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Got a couple heads shaking somebody paid attention chemistry he basically came up with something

377
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 called the heliocentric theory heliocentric theory at that time introduced the idea that

378
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 hey I don't think the world revolves or the universe revolves around the earth the universe

379
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 revolves around the sun and people are like no that's crazy that can't be the case and

380
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 he was like I'm looking through these telescopes and I'm telling you guys I think we revolve

381
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 around the sun and there's something took place called a Copernican revolution where

382
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 people were introduced to the idea that oh the universe doesn't revolve around us it

383
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 revolves around the sun what needs to take place in the life of every single Christian

384
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 is embracing on a daily basis the world around me does not revolve around me it revolves

385
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 around the son of God and anytime that I put myself in the middle or I'm more concerned

386
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 about me and all of the things in my life that I am about God pride is invaded in and

387
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 having a revolution take place where I put back at the center of life Jesus all of life

388
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 revolves around Jesus you cannot experience the life that he wants you to have the life

389
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 that our world needs what our church needs to be without putting Jesus at the center

390
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 of the story all of it revolves around him and that response despite the fact that he

391
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 is at the center of the universe whether I believe it or accept it or not he took the

392
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 response that he is at the center of the universe but even though that was true he became a

393
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 man and humbled himself to the point of even dying on a cross and because of that because

394
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 of the reverse economy of way God works that opposite of our world around us God said hey

395
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 that name will be the name that above every other person on planet earth will be exalted

396
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 forever and ever and ever that whoever humbles himself will be exalted and he went to the

397
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 greatest length of humility and humbling himself and because of that Paul finishes the passage

398
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 and says this therefore God elevated him to the place of highest honor gave him the name

399
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 above every other name that is the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and

400
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 on earth and under the earth and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory

401
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 of the Father I don't know how we move forward or what it will look like when we move forward

402
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 but I know that scripture indicates that it only can happen if humility marks our life

403
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 and we come to the table and we listen and there is so much division and I hate it and

404
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 I hate any ways that I am contributing or have contributed to it or I hate even just

405
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 the pain that people are experiencing and I want to talk to my friends who have for

406
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 so long displayed humility and patience and grace who make up the black and brown brothers

407
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 and sisters in Christ the way that you so many of you have pushed through pain unspeakable

408
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 pain pain that candidly I don't know if this is surprising you I'm a white guy I'll never

409
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 actually experience or understand or totally be able to relate to and yet despite that

410
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 despite all the pain that has marked your life or maybe has been a part of the story

411
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 that God has written you patiently continue you endure suffering in the face of injustice

412
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 like I may never be able to experience or will probably never experience and you keep

413
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 going the way that you patiently come alongside other Christian believers and brothers and

414
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 sisters in the body of Christ you help them you engage in conversations you don't shame

415
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 them you don't dismiss them you walk with them and you look like Jesus and you inspire

416
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 me and you strengthen our church and you strengthen the body of Christ and I'm so grateful and

417
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 I like so many others when I see the pain and hurt my heart breaks but the answer and

418
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 the next step or whatever God's going to do in our church it will involve us coming together

419
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 and listening and loving we are blood because we have been bonded by the blood of Jesus

420
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 and I'm not going to do it perfectly and I haven't done it perfectly and I'll never do

421
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 it perfectly and I need your help and you need our help we are the only hope the world

422
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 has there's no solution if the people of God can't unite and be bonded what other hope

423
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 do we have but we can and it involves humility I don't know what actions you need to take

424
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 this week I know some of us need to reach out and we need to make phone calls we need

425
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 to follow up we need to ask others to help us see our pride in our life all of which

426
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 are just going to take steps in the direction of what Jesus says is true greatness steps

427
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 in the direction of being marked by the quality that has the potential to heal our world to

428
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 heal our hurts and to unite our church the body of Christ all over the world let me pray

429
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 father I thank you for just the ways that you are greater than the world around us you

430
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 are stronger you restore you heal you bring unity you know well what it was like to experience

431
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 injustice and I see in the reflection of many of my black brown friends I see you in them

432
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 because I see the way that they experience injustice it's not fair that's not right that's

433
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 not deserved and yet despite all of that they look to you they push through they respond

434
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 as you call them to and they look like you I pray that you would heal our land God you

435
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 would end the division at least in the church we can't be responsible for the division in

436
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 the world around us but we can as a body of Christ come together and so will you help

437
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 us I pray right now for every every word and every sentence that I just spoke that someone

438
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 out and right now is listening to that dismissed every other thing that I said because they

439
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 held on to that and rightly or wrongly heard something that discouraged them that you would

440
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 meet them where they are with grace you'd help us be your people forgive us for the

441
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 ways that we haven't been unite us together make us like Christ we worship you now in

442
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 song amen
