[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:36.360]   Come on, Forbes.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.880]   Let me hear from you.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.600]   How are we doing?
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.920]   We doing OK?
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.240]   Hey, it's great to see you.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.760]   Welcome back.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.960]   So glad to have you in the room.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.280]   Special shout out to everybody that's tuning in online.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.600]   We love that you would be in the space with us.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.440]   Portslive Midlands, Springfield, Greater Lafayette,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.400]   we love you guys.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.680]   Thanks for being a part of Tuesday nights.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.320]   Man, I'm eager for tonight.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.520]   I think God has something really good for us.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.240]   I'm ready to jump into it.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.520]   If you're here for the very first time, welcome.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.060]   It's also fun to look across the room
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.520]   and see a bunch of familiar faces.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.640]   So thanks for continuing to show up and be with us
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.840]   and be a part of what God is doing here.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.440]   Well, early in my young adult years,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.360]   I encountered what was one of the most frightening moments
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.960]   in my life to that time and quite possibly one
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.320]   of the most frightening moments that I've had since that time.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.800]   You see, it was around Christmas.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.060]   And I still lived in College Station, Texas.
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.800]   And what was characteristically true of a college town
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.120]   was during Christmas, most people would,
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.200]   they would evacuate, like they would leave,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.280]   they would get out of town.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.280]   And I wasn't married at the time,
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.320]   so I still had college roommates
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.680]   and all of them had done exactly that.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.080]   They had all left the city.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.400]   They had all gone home to be with their friends and family.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.360]   I had one buddy that played for the football team.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.840]   And so he was away on a bowl game.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.040]   And so I'm at the house holding it down all by myself.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.880]   And so I'm doing what normal people do,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.700]   late into the evening.
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.660]   I'm just like, I'm doing laundry, I'm fixing food.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.920]   I'm just trying to pass the time until I can go to sleep.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.960]   And so one thing that I customarily did
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.240]   is I would start a load of laundry
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.080]   and then I would wake up and I would transition it.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.960]   And so I was doing that.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.140]   I was in the laundry room, I'm putting a load in.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.800]   And as I'm doing that, just to my left, outside the window,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   I see some headlights kind of span across the window
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.960]   and then stop.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.520]   So I walk over and I just like peek through the blinds
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.040]   and I look to see what I can find.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.160]   And what I see there is a truck, a really nice truck,
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.740]   but a truck I'd never seen before, pulled up to my house.
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.500]   It wasn't pulled up like you would normally see someone
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.920]   if they were parking to come inside.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.000]   Like it had pulled up and it was sitting at a diagonal.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.560]   Like it was at a 45 degree angle, was not parked to stay.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.840]   And yet as I was inspecting and trying to put together,
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.280]   man, what's actually happening here?
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.640]   I saw two guys hop out of the truck.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.280]   And so they pile out and they walk to the back of the pickup
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.920]   and they grab out of the back a couple of big duffel bags.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.880]   I'm like, man, this all surely has a plausible explanation
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.760]   until they cross through my yard
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.240]   and they make their way to my front door.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.960]   Now I'm not one to normally panic,
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.920]   but in this moment, my heart began to race a little bit.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.940]   And so I'm trying to make sense of who these guys are.
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.960]   Because like I said, I have four roommates,
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.840]   three of which are gone.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.840]   One is already out of town.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.680]   He's at a bowl game.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.560]   And so no one should be dropping by our house,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.320]   especially this late in the evening.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.180]   And so I'm trying to do the mental math,
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.560]   put it all together when I begin to not only see
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.400]   them approach the front door,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.300]   but I actually begin to hear murmuring inside of my house.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.260]   And so I stopped doing my laundry.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.460]   And I start processing what it is they're saying,
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.240]   though I can't hear them because again, I'm in the garage,
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.000]   they're in the front entryway.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.760]   And yet I can track their voices
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   as they move through my house.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.120]   They go from the entry into the living area.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.920]   They turn the corner and they come into our dining room.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.260]   And I lost a foot in the kitchen,
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.140]   which is just a door away from where I stood.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.900]   What do you think I did in that moment?
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.740]   Open the door and said, "Hey guys, what's up?"
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.660]   No, absolutely not.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.020]   I decided to bail.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.920]   I ran.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.300]   I slid the garage door open and I ran for my car.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.300]   I turned it on immediately.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.140]   I hit the ignition and I got out of there
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.420]   because this was not a situation
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.220]   that I wanted to be a part of.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.260]   Now, as I'm driving away, I do the only sensible thing.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.100]   I think to myself, I've got to call the cops.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.280]   Like I've got to get some help.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.460]   I've got to report the fact that there are unknown strangers
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.300]   inside my house.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.980]   So I call up a college station police department
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.260]   and the rest of the experience felt like something
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.900]   straight out of cops.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.140]   Like I'm still on the phone with police dispatch,
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.280]   but I can also hear their correspondence
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.040]   with the responders that are showing up to my place.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.060]   We can confirm we've arrived.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.220]   Truck is pulled at a 45 degree angle, still running.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.380]   House lights are all off,
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.860]   except the garage does have a light on.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.480]   No kidding, I was in there.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.740]   Making our way to the front door.
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.580]   Okay, we're gonna knock and announce.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.660]   (knocking)
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.740]   Police, open up.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.780]   No response.
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.260]   (knocking)
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.740]   Police, open up.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.540]   No response.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.940]   One more time.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.060]   (knocking)
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.500]   Police, open up, we're coming in.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.220]   And then immediately the door swings open
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.660]   and there trained on three assault rifles
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.260]   is my college roommate, Blaine,
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.980]   who had very unexpectedly made a return trip that day
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.740]   from the bowl game
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.940]   because the team decided to come home early.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.260]   You see, I had a very limited perspective
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.740]   about what was happening in my roommate's life.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.220]   I thought I knew one thing,
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.620]   but in reality something different
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.580]   was happening altogether.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.700]   I had a limited perspective
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.020]   and that limited perspective
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.200]   was almost massively consequential.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.500]   Now, don't worry, Blaine was fine.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.180]   It was just a misunderstanding.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.300]   But while it's one thing to misunderstand
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.900]   the facts about your roommate's travel plans,
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.300]   it's another thing to misunderstand
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.480]   the facts around your plans for eternity.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.720]   Like it's possible to be put in a situation
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.300]   where you're operating with a limited perspective
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.940]   on reality rather than a complete picture of reality.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.780]   And if that's the case,
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.700]   what you need is you need the truth.
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.620]   Why do you need the truth?
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.620]   Because there are consequences to being wrong in life.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.520]   Like there are repercussions to operating in error.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.300]   Like there is a massive issue
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.540]   if you give the wrong kind
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.980]   or the wrong amount of medicine to someone,
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.100]   that's not helpful, that's harmful.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.260]   If you book the right flight,
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.740]   but board the wrong flight,
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.820]   you're not going to arrive at the right destination.
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.720]   You're gonna arrive at someplace you never intended to be.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.720]   If you choose to forget that girl's name
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.120]   that happens to be best friends
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.400]   with the one you're interested in,
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.560]   that's not the quickest road to making a good impression.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's the quickest way to ruining one.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Not operating in the truth leads to massive issues.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.440]   If in fact you are errored,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.640]   you're gonna find that you have trouble.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.200]   The truth matters because it not only gives us
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.040]   a correct picture of reality,
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.520]   it gives us a complete picture of reality.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.800]   So helpful illustration just to get your mind around
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.380]   what I'm talking about is last week I was sitting up
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.720]   and watching a show and yet somewhere along the way,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.260]   like the wifi was bad and the show stopped buffering well,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.180]   the resolution decreased.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.320]   And while I could make out some of what was happening,
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.720]   get the broad strokes, could still see the colors,
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.000]   knew there were two figures walking through the woods,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.640]   I couldn't make out the details
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.680]   of what was actually happening.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.560]   I couldn't see their facial expressions.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.120]   I couldn't understand what was happening
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.720]   in the background around them.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.120]   There were certain details to the entire dynamic
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.800]   that were absent me that I needed to know
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.720]   to ultimately put the whole story together.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:36.760]   Truth brings your reality into high definition clarity.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.400]   That's what it does.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.360]   And yet so many of us, we move through life
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.600]   with low resolution because we're operating
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.540]   on the basis of our perspective.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.320]   Or some other error.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.200]   Tonight I wanna help you get greater clarity.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   I want to help you know what is truth.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.360]   And to do it, we're gonna be in Matthew,
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.480]   sorry, John chapter 18.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.080]   We were in Matthew last week.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.040]   John chapter 18.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.920]   While you're turning there,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.000]   we've been in a series called Deconstructed
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.260]   where we've been trying to help you rebuild your reality.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.000]   We just acknowledge that in our modern day,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   there's a lot of good reason to question the faith,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.280]   but there's not good reason to leave it.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.980]   Like out of all the doubts you face
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.820]   and all the questions you have
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.080]   and all the concerns you feel,
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.220]   though they aren't inherently bad,
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.880]   in fact, they can be good
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.460]   should they motivate you to inspect further
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.160]   the things you believe.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.560]   They can become bad if they ultimately lead you
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.120]   to deconstruct to a place where you remove what's weak,
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.040]   but you never put something strong in place instead.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.900]   It's kind of like this.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.620]   Like if you walked into your home
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.680]   and you realized you had a bad foundation,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.760]   the right response in that moment
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.020]   is not to ignore the issue,
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.220]   nor is it to detonate the house.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.120]   The right response is to call up a professional,
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.760]   it's to acknowledge the problem,
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.520]   it's to develop some solutions,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.520]   and then it's to get to work.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.840]   That's what we want you to do when it comes to your faith.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.480]   Yes, it's actually good for you to identify,
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.600]   man, are there areas of doubt,
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.580]   questions I feel, concerns that I have
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.440]   that perhaps there are good answers for.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.260]   If so, what are the answers as opposed to,
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.040]   you know what, this thing is all a hoax.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.740]   I can't believe I ever thought this was true, I'm out.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.480]   That's the wrong reply.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.560]   And what we're talking about tonight
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.040]   is actually probably for many of us,
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.020]   the biggest, most awkward crack in our spiritual foundation,
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.880]   it's the idea of truth.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.720]   And yet what you need to know
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.840]   is Jesus was obsessed with the idea of truth.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.620]   He loved processing this with his people.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.160]   And we're looking into a specific story
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.960]   where he is actually engaging this idea of truth
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.860]   more so than most.
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.340]   You see, over 80 different times,
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.340]   Jesus spoke the words, I tell you the truth,
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.580]   because he really cared about us
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.740]   having a very clear understanding of reality.
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.540]   And while the Bible may strike you as
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:07.820]   a stuck at some point in times past or antiquated even,
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.960]   what you need to know is that
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.260]   what they face in the Bible
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.820]   are very similar issues to what we face today.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.060]   You shouldn't just write it off
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.340]   because it's culturally relevant to us right now.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.660]   Like they face religious extremism and political corruption,
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.260]   institutional oppression,
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.820]   cross-cultural conflict and gender inequality.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.760]   You think this has something
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.540]   that can actually speak into your world?
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.580]   I guarantee you it does.
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.340]   And so what we see in Matthew chapter 18,
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.340]   John chapter 18.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.860]   John chapter 18.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.740]   As we see this in verse 33,
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.940]   we're gonna read the entire section together
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.380]   and then we'll talk about it.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:55.780]   So Pilate, who is the governor from Rome
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.900]   over the Judean province,
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.180]   entered his headquarters, the Praetorium again,
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.500]   and he called Jesus and said to him,
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.820]   are you the king of the Jews?
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.340]   And Jesus answered, do you say this of your own accord?
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.160]   Or did others say it to you about me?
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.640]   Pilate answered, am I a Jew?
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.720]   Your own nation and the chief priests
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.240]   have delivered you over to me.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.940]   What have you done?
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.520]   And Jesus answered, my kingdom's not of this world.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.880]   If my kingdom were of this world,
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.000]   my servants would have been fighting
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.520]   that I might not be delivered over to the Jews,
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.680]   but my kingdom is not from the world.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.140]   Then Pilate said to him, so you are a king.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.000]   And Jesus answered, you say that I'm a king.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.400]   For this purpose I was born
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.220]   and for this purpose I have come into the world
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.240]   to bear witness to the truth.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.960]   Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.540]   And Pilate said to him, what is truth?
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:55.920]   This is fascinatingly the last intimate conversation
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.720]   Jesus likely ever had.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.920]   Because to give you contextual background,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.480]   he is on the final day of his life.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.740]   He is experiencing trial, six in specific,
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.680]   three religious, three Roman,
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.480]   that will lead to his condemnation.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.560]   And as he has this conversation with Pilate,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.880]   he begins to help him understand what truth actually is,
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.600]   what truth actually isn't,
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.720]   and how he and we fit into it all.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.640]   So Jesus says, in response to Pilate's question,
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.960]   hey, are you the king of the Jews?
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.520]   He looks at me and says, are you asking me this
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.440]   or are others asking me this?
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.080]   Because he's trying to get to the center of Pilate's motive.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.600]   He wants to know, are you genuinely, seriously,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.000]   sincerely spiritually seeking,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   or are you just a puppet asking the questions of other men?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.760]   You see, by this point, Jesus has been wrongly arrested,
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.920]   he's been falsely accused,
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.740]   and now he is ultimately condemned to death.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.720]   And it's been done so by the religious leaders of his day,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.720]   a group of guys known as the Sanhedrin,
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.560]   who were threatened by him.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.840]   You see, they were threatened by Jesus
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.280]   because he had exposed their corruption,
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.400]   he had undermined all of their authority,
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.840]   and he had endangered their political power.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.800]   And so what they want to do is they want to get rid of him.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.400]   They don't want him around any longer,
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.640]   and so they brought Pilate into the scenario
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.640]   to ultimately bring about Roman execution
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.200]   because they cannot kill one of their own.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.000]   And so what they decide is to use Pilate.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.120]   Pilate asks the question, are you a king?
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.580]   And Jesus sniffs it out.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.160]   He realizes, you're not asking me
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.280]   because you're really wondering,
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.520]   you're asking because they are actually trying
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.600]   to figure out if I will admit to being king or not.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.200]   The truth of the matter is Jesus is king.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.320]   He's king of the Jews.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.160]   Like technically speaking, he is the Messiah,
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.440]   he's the anointed one, he's the long-awaited king of Israel.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.920]   And yet in this moment, he doesn't fess up to it immediately
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.040]   because he wants to have this conversation,
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.360]   and he wants to accomplish,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.600]   he wants to accomplish a message on truth.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.320]   You see, Jesus, though he is the true king,
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.760]   he knows some people don't really want the truth.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.100]   They just want to protect their way of life.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.240]   But here's the thing, first point,
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.880]   the truth does not exist to serve our agenda.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.040]   The truth does not exist to serve our agenda,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.960]   at least that's what Jesus wants us to know,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.400]   and yet in our postmodern age,
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.520]   that's often what we think the truth exists for.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.080]   Like we want a truth that accommodates our comforts
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.320]   and it appeals to our preferences,
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.200]   and indulges our individuality,
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.000]   which leads us to treat the truth
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.640]   like shampoo at the grocery store.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.600]   Hey man, what do you need?
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.000]   You got fizzy hair, you got oily hair,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.560]   you got dry hair, you got damaged hair,
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.680]   whatever kind of shampoo you need,
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.640]   just pull it off the shelf,
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.920]   whatever truth you need to accommodate your way of life,
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.080]   just grab it for yourself, whatever you want.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.660]   It's out there, it's available,
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.200]   and the way we see this play out in our culture
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.400]   is through different philosophies we should consider
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.240]   and worldviews that we should follow.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.820]   You know them, you've heard of these.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.140]   So many people advocate for relativism,
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.980]   that there's no such thing as one truth,
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.780]   that we can all have our own truth,
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:07.660]   unless your truth disagrees with my relative truth,
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.800]   then we're gonna have a problem.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.860]   Or skepticism, another philosophy that's wildly popular,
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.580]   that truth actually isn't knowable.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.420]   In fact, anything we think we can know,
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.380]   we probably should doubt instead.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.720]   We should question, we should wonder if it's actually valid.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.420]   It's not knowable, which is ironic,
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.060]   because the guy that came up with skepticism
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.500]   clearly thought there was a truth to know
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.480]   to develop that idea.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.980]   Or postmodernism, like truth is just an illusion.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.460]   It can't actually be affirmed.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.300]   Well, tell that to the people
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.000]   that affirm postmodernism is true.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.460]   Or pluralism, like all truths are equally valid.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.460]   Like you can believe your truth,
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.300]   and you can believe your truth,
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.120]   and you can believe your truth,
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.640]   and I'll believe my truth, and they're all legit,
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.780]   they're all valid.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.700]   That is, unless your truth contradicts my truth,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.300]   and that doesn't make any sense.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.900]   Or logical positivism,
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.780]   the idea that man, absolute truth does exist,
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.700]   but it must be scientifically verifiable,
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.980]   even though there are some scientific concepts
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.980]   that are not verifiable in and of themselves.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.940]   You see, our world is convinced
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.340]   that rather than conform the truth,
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.660]   our lives to the truth,
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.760]   we will conform the truth to our lives.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.140]   We will bend it, we will distort it,
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.300]   we will manipulate it to accommodate
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.820]   whatever sort of life we want
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.820]   as opposed to obstruct whatever sort of life
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.220]   God wants instead.
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.280]   That's what the religious leaders are doing in this story.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.580]   Like rather than listen to Jesus, the voice of truth,
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.620]   they're indulging deceit,
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.680]   not only in their own lives, but the lives of others,
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.140]   listening to the voice of deception
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.780]   just to protect the kind of lifestyle they wanna have.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.720]   And we do this ourselves.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.580]   And we don't like what God has to say about our sexuality.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.520]   And so we claim he's not loving because of it.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.100]   We don't like the fact that Christians say
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.360]   masturbation is wrong,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.360]   even though the Bible doesn't explicitly say
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.680]   that we shouldn't do it.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.520]   And so you know what,
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.200]   I'm just gonna make an exception for that one instead.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.840]   Or we don't like the fact that God says drunkenness is wrong
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.640]   but truthfully God, like what is drunk?
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.120]   I don't know, is it this, is it that?
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.000]   Is it getting buzzed?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.280]   Is it having a few too many?
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.720]   Or is it just kicking some back with the boys?
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.840]   I'm not real sure, so you know what?
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.080]   I'll toe the line as opposed to stay away from it.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.280]   And we don't like the fact that God feels
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.360]   like a narrow-minded bigot.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.280]   Like how are you going to tell me what to do with my body?
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.640]   My body is mine.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.460]   I can do with it what I want.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.400]   Or maybe it's not that.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.600]   Maybe instead it's the fact that the Bible,
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.440]   when you read through it,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.320]   feels so patriarchal or so chauvinistic
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.300]   and you don't wanna follow a backwoods God
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.840]   that would subscribe these sorts of truths
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.200]   to the lives of his people.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   Listen to me, I'm not saying
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.440]   that you don't have legitimate questions
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.480]   about some of this stuff,
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.380]   but I am saying there are legitimate answers to all of it.
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:59.100]   You may not know them yet, but they are available.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.400]   So recently I saw this story of a guy
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.320]   who has semi-made it his life mission
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.600]   to convince flat earthers that the world is round.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.080]   And so he gathers up a crew of them
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.320]   and he takes them down to Antarctica
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   because it's there that you can see the sun revolve
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.040]   in a circle, proving the fact that the earth is round.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.800]   It doesn't rise in the east and set in the west.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.840]   And so he takes a guy and he leads him to Antarctica.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.760]   He is fully convinced the world is flat.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.600]   And yet as he stands there and he watches the sun
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.560]   circulate over his head for 24 hours,
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.480]   he says these words.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.160]   He says, "Well, sometimes you're wrong in life."
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.840]   I was pretty sure I wasn't, but it's a fact.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.340]   The sun does circle you in the south,
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.400]   but that's not even the best part.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.560]   Best part of this story is that the guy,
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.000]   though he was proven,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.200]   though he was proven to have believed something wrong,
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.320]   he actually thanked the guy for being kind enough
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.240]   to lead him to the Southern continent
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.400]   to teach him the truth.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   It can feel arrogant for Christians to claim
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.440]   that they have the right view and everyone else is wrong.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.720]   And admittedly, some Christians are extremely arrogant
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.600]   with the truth.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.320]   But here's what I want you to know.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.480]   If a follower of Jesus not only claims to know the truth,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.720]   but actually shares it with someone, that's not arrogance.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.600]   That's kindness.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.040]   It's kindness to give the truth of God to other people.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.360]   And that's what Jesus is advising we do here.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.480]   The truth, it doesn't exist to serve your agenda.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.480]   It exists to make sense of your reality.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.520]   So then what is that reality?
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.000]   Well, Jesus is going to continue on.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.360]   He says in 35 and 36, he says,
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.920]   "But Pilate answered, 'Am I a Jew?
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.040]   "Your own nation, your chief priests,
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.180]   "they've delivered you over to me.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.680]   "What have you done?'
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.780]   "Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.180]   "If my kingdom were of this world,
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.220]   "my servants would have been fighting
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.760]   "that I might not be delivered over to the Jews,
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.320]   "but my kingdom is not from the world.'"
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.080]   It's funny, when you read through this dialogue
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.360]   between Pilate and Jesus,
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.000]   Jesus is very specific, strategic
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.480]   about the things that he says.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.040]   And yet there is some element of comedy
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.000]   because he never answers Pilate's question straight on.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.440]   Like Pilate's asking, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.520]   Are you asking or someone else?
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.820]   "Well, what have you done?"
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.640]   "My kingdom is not of this world."
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.160]   So you are a king.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.260]   You say I'm a king.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.880]   Like Jesus consistently avoids the question.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.320]   But in this moment, we should connect his answer
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.760]   to the first question.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.520]   Pilate originally asked him, "So you're a king?"
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.000]   Jesus looks at him and now says,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.960]   "My kingdom is not of this world."
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.280]   He addresses to Pilate that, "Yes, I am a king,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.680]   "but I'm not the kind of king you expect,
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.280]   "nor am I the kind of king that you should be worried about.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.740]   "I'm not a threat to Caesar.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.040]   "Like I'm not worried about Roman sovereignty.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.920]   "I don't have military might at my disposal.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.200]   "I'm not exercising political power
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.040]   "because I am not here to conflict as an earthly king
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.200]   "with the religious leaders.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.620]   "Instead, I am here as a heavenly king
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.280]   "to conflict with the evil spirits of this world.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.080]   "I have come to save my people,
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.080]   "not just establish an earthly realm."
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:22.640]   You see, he answers in a way
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.180]   that exceeds Pilate's personal vantage point.
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:31.340]   Because the truth transcends our own perspectives.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.460]   The truth transcends our own perspectives.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.840]   That's the second thing you need to know.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.200]   Like we live in a really complicated
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.440]   cultural dynamic right now.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.640]   I'm not sure if you've noticed,
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.460]   but our world is more globalized than ever.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.280]   Like through immigration and international travel
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.600]   and the internet, we are more connected to other people
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.600]   than we have ever been.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.980]   And because of that, we're connected to a variety
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.940]   of religious backgrounds and cultural upbringings
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.440]   and ethnic diversities that really provide our world
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.020]   with a beautiful level of difference between people.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.300]   It's a globalized society,
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.200]   but it's not just a globalized society.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.120]   It's a secularized society.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.680]   Like if you look into the culture,
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.540]   you can see at the center of so many conversations
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.120]   or issues about sexual identity or gender equality
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.600]   or social responsibility or human rights,
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.520]   this is the world we live in right now.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.360]   You and I, because of it,
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.240]   have been exposed to a broader audience of people
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.400]   and as a result, a broader array of perspectives.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.600]   But here's the thing that we need to understand.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.420]   Perspective is not synonymous with truth.
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.920]   Perspective is not synonymous with truth.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.920]   So just take my story from the beginning of the night,
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.760]   for example.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.000]   My perspective actually aligned with truth.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.480]   I could make sense of some of the stuff that was happening,
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.160]   unknown figures making their way into my house,
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.620]   they moved through certain corridors
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.920]   until they arrived at a spot that terrified me.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.280]   I could make sense by way of my perspective of some things,
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   but I could not make sense of all things
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.660]   because of my perspective.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.320]   There was a greater truth at play.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.860]   And what happened is it led me to think I was being robbed.
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.160]   It ultimately almost arrested my roommate
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   and it put us in a position
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.540]   where none of the above should have happened.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.540]   Your perspective is not synonymous with truth.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.840]   You see, the truth always transcends our own perspective,
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.960]   which when you think about it,
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.800]   can be a pretty hard thing to come to grips with.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.240]   Since really all you and I have is our perspective.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.480]   Like your perspective is informed
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.520]   by way of the story you have,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.200]   the people you know, the family that's formed you,
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.540]   the pain of your past, the things you've endured.
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.900]   Your perspective is yours.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.720]   It's been cultivated over the course of time
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.420]   and it's led you to a spot where you look at the world
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.640]   a very specific way.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.040]   And so to learn that my perspective is insufficient
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.240]   to make sense of true reality
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:58.120]   means that I need to draw on something outside of myself
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.080]   to make better sense of what's happening in the world.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.320]   Now you can draw on a variety of different things,
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.240]   admittedly, there are some things
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.120]   that are better than others.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.700]   Like, listen, if you're expecting that guy
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.100]   to make sense of your reality,
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.900]   he is going to sorely disappoint you.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.600]   Like, have you watched him?
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.320]   It's like food and video games.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.120]   You know, you think that's gonna solve
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.120]   all of the truth questions that you have in life?
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.320]   No, it's not gonna be your job.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.960]   Like your employer has not brought you on
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.040]   because they wanna help you solve the big questions
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.280]   in life.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   No, they have brought you on
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.640]   because they care about the bottom line
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.920]   and the bottom line only.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.360]   Those are not places to look to make sense
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.160]   of what's happening in the world
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.800]   and what should be true as you survey it.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.920]   This is actually why religion matters.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.520]   Like religion offers a truth claim about reality.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.600]   And I'm not even just talking about Christianity right now,
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.320]   I'm just saying religion in general.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.360]   Like that's what it does.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.080]   That's what it serves the purpose for
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.300]   is it provides us some semblance of understanding
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.440]   what's happening in the world.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.760]   It gives us a truth claim to consider.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.640]   Jesus, he says it like this in John eight,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.040]   he says, "Hey, if you hold to my teaching,
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.100]   "you're really my disciples.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.340]   "Then you will know the truth
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.080]   "and the truth will set you free."
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.220]   Like Jesus is making a claim
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.080]   that it's not gonna be his disciples perspective alone
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.200]   that leads them to truth,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.280]   that it's gonna be his teaching,
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.000]   something outside of themselves
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.160]   that's going to help them find the real truth,
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.100]   the truth that will ultimately set them free.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.960]   So it begs the question for us,
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.340]   what teaching do you choose?
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.000]   Like what path do you follow?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.860]   Like don't all religions lead to heaven?
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.400]   Don't they all teach the same thing?
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.160]   Aren't there multiple routes up the mountain?
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.680]   No, there are not.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.560]   Despite how compelling that idea is.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.280]   And listen, I get it.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.360]   The thought of standing here and telling you
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.800]   that religion is actually not inclusive in nature
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.040]   is a hard thing to say
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.860]   because I would love for us to all just link arms
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.000]   and sing Kumbaya and get along and no one be judgmental.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.080]   Everybody is welcomed here.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.220]   And yet the reality is that's just not how truth works.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.480]   Like religions, they don't even claim that that is the case.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.120]   Like they're not interested in social harmony
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.960]   at the expense of their individual theology.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.180]   So while it might be convenient for us to say
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.200]   that all religious paths lead to heaven,
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.560]   they provide eternal life,
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.960]   that some method of morality,
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.880]   whatever it is you prefer,
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.160]   will ultimately get you to the pearly gates,
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.940]   it's true, it's just not.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.960]   I remember reading a story that Abraham Lincoln
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.120]   once had an interaction with a group of people
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.740]   on the topic of truth.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.240]   They were highly interested, enthusiastic.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.880]   And so he looked at them and he posed them a famous question.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.620]   He said, how many legs would a sheep have
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.120]   if you called its tail a leg?
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.780]   They very quickly answered five.
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.200]   Then the president looked at them and said, no,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.480]   it would only have four legs.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.200]   Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.120]   Just because you think it's true doesn't mean it is.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.920]   And just because you think all religions get to heaven
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.200]   doesn't mean they do.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.800]   And the reality of the matter is
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.160]   any orthodox religion will look at you and say,
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.620]   we don't believe that either.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.220]   Like I love the way John Tyson, he said it this way,
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.100]   all religions make general claims about reality,
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.860]   but very specific claims about salvation.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.300]   Why does salvation matter?
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.140]   Because salvation leads to eternal life.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.780]   And so all religions have differing positions
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.640]   on what it looks like to get to eternal life.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.500]   And those specific claims, they not only differ,
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.620]   they matter.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.500]   Like Muslims, they identify good deeds as the goal.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.140]   That's what will achieve everlasting life.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.700]   Buddhists, they focus on self-actualization.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.940]   Christian scientists see salvation as a mental process
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.700]   of overcoming material beliefs.
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.140]   Hindus achieve salvation by way of one of three things,
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.580]   way of works, ways of knowledge, and ways of devotion.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.380]   New-agers, they believe in becoming one with the universe,
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.820]   whether through psychedelics or reincarnation.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.060]   And Christians, we believe that salvation
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.340]   is found in Christ alone.
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.620]   To say that you believe all these things
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.740]   lead to eternal life is to actually claim
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.140]   that you don't believe any one of them
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.020]   leads to eternal life.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.140]   Because if you know them as they are put forward,
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.940]   none of them agree with the others.
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.300]   Like they take offense to the fact
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.260]   that you think all of them could work in harmony
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.180]   because they don't.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.540]   Truth is narrow.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.700]   Like truth is a door that unlocks
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.140]   according to one key and one key only.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.580]   That's what Jesus said.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.340]   He said this in Matthew 7, he said,
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.820]   "Enter by the narrow gate.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.100]   "For the gate is wide, and the way is easy
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.020]   "that leads to destruction.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.180]   "And those who enter by it are many.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.260]   "For the gate is narrow, and the way is hard
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.500]   "that leads to life, and those who find it are few."
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.700]   There's only one path that leads to everlasting life.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.300]   There's only one key that unlocks that door.
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.820]   So then what is it?
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.540]   Like that should be the question boiling up inside.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.780]   Like, okay, Kylan, if everything you're saying is true,
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.940]   like if everything you're saying makes sense,
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.540]   if this line of logic actually is plausible,
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.860]   then what is it?
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.380]   What is the truth?
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.860]   Well, you were asking the same question Pilot himself has.
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.140]   And Jesus gives the answer.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.500]   He says to Pilot's question, "So you're a king?
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.940]   "You say that I'm a king.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.400]   "For this purpose, I was born,
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.980]   "and for this purpose, I have come into the world
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.680]   "to bear witness to the truth.
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.980]   "Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.100]   And then Pilot asks, "What is truth?"
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:52.400]   So just try to think through what Jesus actually said.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.500]   Like it could be easy to just casually move through it
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.660]   and just kind of continue on.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.380]   That's another claim of Christ, no big deal.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.820]   What did Jesus actually just say?
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.980]   Because it's really radical in nature.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.220]   Like Jesus just made this extravagant claim,
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.740]   and yet it's also an extraordinary claim.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.580]   Like he's saying that his voice is the voice
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.520]   which equates to truth.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.660]   That if you're looking for truth, it is found in him.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.880]   And yet that's not the only radical claim Jesus makes.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.120]   Like that voice which speaks truth is a voice
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.000]   that makes consistently climactic claims
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.900]   over the course of his ministry.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.160]   Claims that say things like he claimed to be equal with God.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.400]   He claimed to be the Messiah sent from God.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.360]   He claimed to be the son of man.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.680]   He claimed to give eternal life.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.480]   He claimed to save the world.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.840]   He claimed to forgive sins.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.240]   He claimed to know the father.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.640]   He claimed to fulfill the law.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.520]   He claimed to give rest to the weary and the wandering soul.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.100]   He claimed to have the words of eternal life.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.120]   Those were the words which fell from his lips.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.980]   He claimed to be the future judge,
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.080]   the one that we would one day stand before.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.740]   And he claimed to be the great I am.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:02.320]   And most importantly for this talk,
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.880]   he claimed to be the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.780]   Like no one comes to the father except through him.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.220]   He goes on to say in John 14, verse seven,
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.420]   right after that statement, that if you had known me,
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.140]   you would have known my father also.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:17.980]   Why?
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.760]   Because from now on, you do know him and you've seen him
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.540]   because you've seen me.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.960]   Now, it's really possible to read these claims
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.060]   and just think like, okay, man,
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.020]   it's just more religious jargon.
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.220]   It's just more claims from Christ.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.380]   And yet when we hear things as audacious
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.820]   and ridiculous as this, it should cause us to stop
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.140]   because people don't speak this way.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.820]   And when people speak this way, we should judge them.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.340]   Kanye West said, "God chose me.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.060]   He made a path for me.
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.940]   I am God's vessel, but my greatest pain in life
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.780]   is that I will never be able to see myself perform live."
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:02.660]   That is a ridiculous claim and it deserves to be judged.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.340]   Cristiano Ronaldo, "People whistle me
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:11.340]   because I am good looking, rich, and a great footballer.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.300]   They're jealous of me."
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:19.060]   Zlatan Ibrahimovic, when asked what he got his ex-fiance
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.620]   for an engagement gift, said, "What do you mean present?
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.000]   She got Zlatan."
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.940]   Infamously, Drake said, "Last name ever,
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.660]   first name greatest."
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.500]   That deserves to be judged.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:43.380]   Like I didn't particularly pick out hip hop artists
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.180]   and footballers for that demonstration.
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.740]   And yet you just make whatever conclusions you want of it.
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.780]   They seem to be the most arrogant of us, you know?
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.920]   But when we hear laudy and audacious,
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.500]   ridiculous claims like that,
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.420]   what it means is we should actually lean in
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.580]   and investigate what are you saying and is it true?
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:06.180]   Jesus is making an even greater claim.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:13.300]   And the reality of it is he's not stroking his own ego.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.060]   He's not beating his chest.
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.280]   He's not trying to acquire followers.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.260]   Jesus is not someone that is interested
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.620]   in popularity at all.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.980]   He's interested in the truth.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.980]   That's what Jesus wants.
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.780]   He wants it so badly that he would say things that are,
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.820]   man, they're wild, but they're wonderful
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.920]   because they accord with truth.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.900]   You see, he is addressing himself
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.500]   as the answer to life's biggest questions.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.820]   He tells us that he is the source of purpose.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.740]   Like if you're here and you're wanting for purpose,
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:47.940]   if you're looking for meaning,
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.540]   if you want fulfillment in life, he's like, "Hey, it's me.
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.560]   Like I'm the source of your purpose.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.620]   It's not found anywhere else.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.060]   It's found in me."
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.740]   But it's not just that he's giving you the answer
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.380]   to where do I find purpose in life?
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.220]   He's also looking and saying, "Hey, I actually have
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.100]   the solution for your problem in life."
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.760]   Like, maybe you don't know,
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.100]   your biggest issues are not at work.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.720]   It's not your relationship status.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.980]   Your biggest problem is not the fact
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.900]   that your family has some disagreement,
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.220]   though those things are legitimate.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.940]   Your biggest problem is that you are lost in sin.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:21.500]   And yet Jesus is saying, "I'm the solution.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.100]   Yeah, source of your purpose,
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.140]   but I'm also the solution for your problem.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.620]   Like I'm the one that could step in the gap
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.900]   between you and God, and I can take the hit.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.020]   I can absorb the wrath.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.220]   I can die your death.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.980]   That way you don't have to.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.220]   But I'm not only that, I'm the substitute you need."
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.420]   Because the reality is if you reject me,
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.540]   you're not enough on your own.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.020]   The truth is you're going to have to pay
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.140]   the penalty for your wrong,
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.780]   and you're not gonna wanna pay it
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.460]   because it's not just today, it's not just tomorrow,
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.180]   it's forever and always.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.900]   But I can be the substitute that you're today
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.580]   and your tomorrow and your forever and always
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.020]   can be different.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.140]   That it's not a life of eternal condemnation,
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.740]   it's a life of everlasting bliss.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:10.700]   But I'm not only that, I'm also your salvation forever.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.500]   Like I'm the one that doesn't just lead you to heaven,
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:18.020]   that doesn't just give you everlasting life.
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.560]   I'm the one that gives you God.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.220]   Do you want Him?
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.460]   Do you want a connection to your creator?
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.580]   A relationship to your maker?
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.340]   It's available.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.660]   And it's available through me.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.020]   That's what Jesus has claimed to you is.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.260]   He is the truth.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.020]   He wants us to know.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.140]   Like there is an objective truth,
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.140]   and its name is Jesus.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:55.500]   Here's the thing, declarations like that
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:00.580]   they demand a decision from us.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.780]   You cannot hear those things
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:09.740]   and then just indifferently pass by.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.780]   It's confronting, it's conflicting,
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.620]   it is a moment of consequence.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.580]   C.S. Lewis said it like this in his book,
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.420]   Mere Christianity, he said,
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.340]   "I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.780]   "the really foolish thing that people often say about Him,"
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.100]   I'm talking about Jesus.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.240]   "I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher,
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.520]   "but I don't accept His claim to be God.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.060]   "That is the one thing we must not say.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.180]   "A man who is merely a man and said the sort of things
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.180]   "Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.180]   "He would either be a lunatic on a level with the man
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.560]   "who says he's a poached egg,
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.480]   "or else he would be the devil of hell.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.140]   "You must make your choice.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.900]   "Either this man was and is the son of God,
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.420]   "or else a madman or something worse."
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.860]   You can shut him up, call him a fool,
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.700]   spit at him and kill him as a demon,
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.700]   or you can fall at his feet
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.200]   and you can call him Lord and God.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:09.320]   But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.360]   about him being a great human teacher.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.380]   He has not left that open to us.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.660]   He did not intend to.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:21.520]   This is the sort of man that Pilate is facing
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.740]   in this passage.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.580]   I don't think he knew it
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.180]   when he first began the conversation,
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.500]   but by the end of it,
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.740]   when he asks the question, what is truth,
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:34.320]   staring back at him is the face of it himself.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   And yet what we see is Pilate in the subsequent chapters,
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:44.620]   chooses not to accord his life with objective truth.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:50.900]   Instead, he bends it to accommodate his preferences
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.640]   and appeal to the approval of others.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.980]   Pilate sacrifices truth
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.860]   on the altar of momentary satisfaction.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:09.100]   And yet the reality is,
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.420]   here tonight we are still face to face with that same man,
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.620]   because that man, though condemned to die
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.380]   and buried for three days, rose forth from the grave.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.080]   And he looks at you this evening
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.060]   the way he looked at Pilate,
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.480]   and he asks, do you want to know what truth is?
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.380]   It's me.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.020]   You're looking at it.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:39.620]   Yes, you can move through this world,
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.620]   and you can accommodate your comforts.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.420]   You can appeal to your preferences.
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:48.180]   You can choose to indulge whatever desire you have
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.640]   and whatever truth allows for it.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.860]   But there's really only one truth,
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.420]   and it's the truth I come to give.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.620]   It's the truth that I offer to all.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:03.640]   Do you want to believe in me?
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.660]   Now you may hear something like that and think to yourself,
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.440]   why should I listen to you?
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:13.260]   Christianity is such an exclusive religion.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.540]   Like it's such a restrictive philosophy.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.300]   Like it's such an impossible path to believe.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.580]   Why would I choose to follow this?
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:26.980]   Here's what I would tell you,
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.700]   that although Christianity may seem exclusive,
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.880]   Jesus is wildly inclusive.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.980]   Like he does not exclude anyone
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.980]   on the basis of their social status or their intelligence,
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.420]   their gender, their race, their nationality,
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.900]   or anything else.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.220]   He invites all people to be a part of his family,
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.580]   to follow him where it is he's going.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:55.380]   The only thing that Jesus excludes
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.260]   is on the basis of sin,
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:02.980]   which he's come to take away forever,
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.840]   if only you would repent and believe.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.260]   You might look at Christianity and say it's so restrictive,
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.660]   yet Jesus has come to set us free.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.940]   Like he does not seek to restrict us
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.860]   with outward rules and regulations.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.940]   He only restricts us from vainly reconciling ourselves
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.020]   to God according to whatever works we can muster up.
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.980]   He's like, you're not enough, you can't do it.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:30.420]   And yet what I will do is I will give you liberty in life,
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.240]   abundant joy, great forgiveness,
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.040]   by living the life you can and dying the death you deserve.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.020]   And although Christianity may seem impossible to believe,
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.620]   Jesus has made it possible to believe.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.860]   Like, yes, these are impossible claims,
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.980]   like never ending life, abounding joy,
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.300]   unfailing purposes, forgiving grace.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.140]   Like you're telling me that stuff is available.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.500]   That seems too wild.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.700]   That seems too crazy.
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.820]   That doesn't seem possible.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.620]   And yet Jesus is looking at you saying, oh, it's possible
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.620]   because that's what I come to give.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.780]   That's the truth I seek to speak.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.220]   That's the kind of life I'm willing to offer
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:10.020]   if you will take it up and follow me.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.220]   And yet they are only impossible to believe
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.380]   for those that do not believe in him.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:20.580]   Porch, this world is filled with alternative truths
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.220]   that will fail you in this life.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.260]   But there's one objective truth,
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.500]   the person of Jesus that will never fail you.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:32.740]   If you're looking for truth, why look any longer?
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:36.580]   He's standing here up front you tonight
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.400]   and he's calling you to believe.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.040]   Let me pray for us.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.220]   God, thanks for tonight.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.260]   Thanks for these people.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.700]   Thanks for your word and the sufficiency therein.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.980]   I'm grateful, God, that you have given us truth, man.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.500]   I just think, Lord, like what would my life be like
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.140]   if I didn't know truth?
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.500]   There was a time when I didn't.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.380]   And what I know, God, is in those days,
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:01.300]   as I look back in reflection, I was so very lost,
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:05.100]   so very alone, desperately trying to find my hope
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.900]   and home and things that promised yet never delivered.
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.900]   And yet when I met you, Christ, I find all of that and more.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.500]   I pray you would come and give that tonight.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.580]   I pray that God, friends here in the room,
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.580]   would receive it.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.500]   I don't know, God.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.960]   I have no doubt that people have been through so much
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.820]   when it comes to their religious past,
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.340]   their experiences in spirituality,
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.460]   the impact of Christians in their life
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.260]   that would lead them, God, to be hesitant
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.860]   to embrace the claims of Christ
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:49.860]   and accept his truth, the truth, for themselves.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.560]   And yet, God, I pray you would soften them here,
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.360]   gently warm their hearts,
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.840]   quickly attune their ears to hear your voice,
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.020]   which calls them out of death
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.240]   and into life.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:11.940]   What is truth?
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:17.140]   The truth is you, Jesus,
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.380]   that only by your blood are all men saved.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.020]   We love you and we sing to you now.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.340]   It is in Christ's name we pray, amen.
