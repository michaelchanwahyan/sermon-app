[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:23.260]   Way.
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.640]   What's going on, porch?
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.320]   Hello, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.800]   and spread out every other place.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.320]   And jumping in online.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.440]   I'm Todd.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.560]   I get to hang out here at Watermark all the time,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.000]   and I love diving in with my friends at the porch.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.560]   Thou shalt.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.320]   Man, you hear a series titled that,
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.480]   and you're kind of like, I don't know.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.640]   Really?
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.960]   You're going to tell me what to do?
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.920]   Well, I'm not.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.280]   But who the one is that is telling you what to do,
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.600]   once you understand that, it's going to change.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.160]   Thou shalt.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.480]   You ready for the first point?
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.120]   If you guys get this right, remember
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.520]   for the rest of the series, we're doing this tonight,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.920]   next week, and then one more.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.320]   We're going to talk about the big 10, the 10 commandments.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.760]   And when we hear the word commands, we all genuflect.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.520]   Like, come on, man.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.960]   Quit wearing me out.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.160]   The reason I didn't follow God for a long time
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.840]   is I thought everything I wanted to do,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.800]   he was going to slap my hand when I reached for it.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.120]   And everything I didn't want to do,
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.720]   he was going to poke me in the back and drive me towards it.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.280]   That was my view of God.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.520]   And because my view of God was wrong, I was living life wrong.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.400]   And when I came to finally understand,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.240]   when I ran into people who know him, when I listened to him
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.520]   and quit telling him who I thought he was,
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.760]   it changed my life.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.920]   Here's the very first thing you need to understand.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.000]   Thou shalt is better understood as because I love you,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.760]   I want you to know.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.920]   When you hear thou shalt, it's better understood
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.960]   because I love you.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.640]   I want you to know this is the love of God,
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.840]   that we keep his commandments, and his commandments
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.080]   are not burdensome.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.000]   Jesus said, now I've come that you might have life
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.160]   and have it abundantly.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.880]   There is an enemy who lies to you about who God is,
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.600]   and he is going to steal your joy.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.960]   He's going to kill your hope.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.080]   He's going to destroy your life.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.640]   And so when God shows up and says, thou shalt,
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.560]   he is not looking to rip you off.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.280]   He is looking to set you free.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.080]   I don't know what you know about your Bible,
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.800]   but if you know much about it at all,
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.200]   you know it's broken up into two major categories,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.000]   an old and a new testament.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.400]   Testament is just a fancy word for a covenant or a way
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.920]   that God is going to relate to us for a season and for time.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.440]   Always, both in the old and the new covenant,
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.360]   you're going to find out that God is good,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.320]   that God is gracious, that God provides for you what you can
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.520]   never earn on your own.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.080]   And all he wants you to do is know him.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.440]   In the Old Testament, you weren't
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.160]   saved because you kept a bunch of rules.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.760]   And in the New Testament, you're not
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.360]   going to be saved because you keep a bunch of rules.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.240]   You are going to be saved when you acknowledge
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.400]   the goodness of God and ask him to do for you what
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.720]   you can't do for yourself.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.680]   It's called the gospel.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.720]   It means good news.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.960]   Let me say it to you again.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.800]   When you hear thou shalt, if you hear anything less than,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.520]   because I love you, I want you to understand this.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.840]   You have bought a lie.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.360]   Every now and then you come across a story that
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.720]   sticks with you for a long time.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.080]   Can you tell that I've had this one for a while?
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.920]   I cut this out of the paper before.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.880]   Maybe most of you--
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.600]   now, you were just now born.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.720]   This is dated June 6, 1986.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.760]   All right?
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.520]   Yeah, you go, wait, bro, are you allowed
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.020]   to take that from the Smithsonian Institute?
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.320]   That's probably what you're thinking right now.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.360]   I've got permission, all right?
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.160]   So here we go.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.960]   I want to read you.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.760]   This is an article.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.920]   The reason I ripped it out is because this young gal that I'm
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.360]   about to tell you about, you see a picture over here.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.240]   This is June 16, 1986.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.000]   It was in Sports Illustrated.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.680]   This was national news.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   There was this young gal named Kathy Orangeby.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.000]   I'm just going to show you this picture just for a second.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.160]   There's a track right there.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.080]   That's where the NCAA national championships were being held.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.560]   Then you see a little softball field, the baseball field,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.360]   and then you see a little bridge right there
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.320]   on the way to the river.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.080]   Remember that bridge.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.640]   I'm going to read this article a little bit out of order.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.640]   Here's what it says.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.320]   "Friends knew Kathy-- Kathy Ormsby
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.840]   is who this article is about--
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.480]   friends knew Kathy Ormsby as a perfectionist who
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.320]   would be up running at 5 AM trying to make herself better.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.520]   She led a charmed, all-American life.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.000]   I guess so."
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.280]   OK, so let me just let you into my world a little bit.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.800]   '86, I was done, all right?
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.640]   I'm out of college.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.920]   I'm out of sports.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.240]   I am adulting.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.440]   We didn't even know what that word was at that time,
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.480]   but I was doing it, all right?
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.800]   We needed you to invent that for us.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.200]   So I was right where you were, and I had just
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:27.480]   spent the first 21 years of my life trying to get places,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.720]   to have things that were going to give me peace,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.360]   to experience things that were going to give me joy,
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.400]   to find things that were going to make me the man.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.040]   And I had run every gamut that men run,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.320]   looking for those things.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.280]   Now, my life, by grace, was interrupted a little bit
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.120]   before this.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.600]   And I started to understand that thou shalt was not
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.840]   the way God started a bunch of rules
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.800]   that he was trying to oppress me with.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.640]   I had just come to understand, not long before this,
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.400]   that thou shalt was better understood because I love you.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.600]   I want you to know this.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.960]   And I had been living underneath, really,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.160]   throughout my college years, I had lived underneath,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.280]   not thou shalt, but because I love you.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.320]   And it changed my life.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.040]   And I found a little girl who was the same age as me,
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.640]   little younger, in fact, who didn't find out what I found
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.680]   out when I did.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.960]   And she ended up where I was going to end up.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.200]   And I ripped it out of the paper.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.320]   This is true about Kathy Ormsby.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.760]   She got places I never had been.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.840]   You get a Kathy Ormsby, says the article,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.320]   but once in a lifetime.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.800]   Said who?
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.680]   Ralph Robertson.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.160]   Who's that?
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.840]   Well, he was the principal of Richmond, North Carolina,
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.640]   Senior High School.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.600]   That's where Kathy went to high school,
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.520]   where she graduated number one in a class of 600
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.480]   with an unprecedented 99% average.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.040]   She never made a B. That's a never made a B.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.200]   That's the one thing that Kathy I had in common.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:16.080]   But this girl right here, OK, this gal was number one.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.560]   She had a 99% grade point average.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.960]   She was the classic overachiever, her principal said.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.960]   Track was just a sideline to what she was about.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   She was a pre-med student, and we
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.660]   knew she was going to do something great.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.240]   12 years of school in Rockingham,
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.560]   Ormsby never received one grade lower than an A. All right,
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.560]   you say, that's fine.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.640]   Good for you, Kathy.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.680]   But you're a geek, right?
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.400]   You don't have any friends.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.720]   You don't do anything but study.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.720]   Wrong.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.200]   Wrong.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.160]   This girl got better grades than me.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.240]   There's a picture of her.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.600]   She's better looking than me.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.080]   It's a low bar right there.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.400]   So far, it was not a big bar to get over,
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.560]   but she was ahead of me in both of these things.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.100]   And she was a better athlete, an All-American, state champion.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.420]   She set three state records.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.060]   She didn't just win her year.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.080]   She was the fastest female runner that
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.580]   ever lived in North Carolina.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.580]   Just before she graduated, I'm like, yes, OK,
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.420]   but don't you hate that kid, right?
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.380]   She got-- never got a B. She won state championships,
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.660]   and she won three--
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.460]   I mean, she set three state records, right?
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.160]   Nobody likes Kathy, right?
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.000]   Listen to the next paragraph.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.880]   "Just before she graduated in 1983,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.920]   the mayors of five communities came together and did something
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.160]   they had never done before.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.600]   They declared a day in honor of Kathy Ormsby.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.920]   Buttons were given to high school students
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.760]   in five districts listing her accomplishments.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.840]   There was an assembly in her honor and a proclamation
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.440]   for her to hang on a wall at her home.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.100]   They had a stinking parade to celebrate this girl.
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.300]   OK, I don't know how popular you were in high school,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.620]   but I'm guessing everybody wasn't giving your button.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:09.180]   I don't think the mayors of five communities, all right,
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.020]   slapped some proclamation together and said,
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.460]   take this to college.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.300]   We're going to miss you.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.860]   Now, here's the problem with high school success, right?
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.140]   There's always another league.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.740]   You got to go to the next thing.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.460]   So Kathy got to college.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.920]   Now we're about to see why we have to follow ourself
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.760]   off that track across the softball field,
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.680]   across the baseball field to a certain bridge.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.920]   Because Kathy probably struggled when she was in college.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.680]   Wrong.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.000]   She was a Dean's List student who
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.640]   held the NCAA double women's record in the 10,000 meter
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.520]   race.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.400]   She was an All-American athlete.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:51.520]   She held the record fastest woman ever to run in college.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.100]   Now, here's the lead paragraph.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.400]   Kathy Ormsby, a record-setting distance runner
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.560]   from North Carolina State University whose life was
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.280]   one triumph after another, is paralyzed from the waist down
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.000]   and is not expected to walk again
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.480]   after she inexplicably jumped from a bridge Wednesday night
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.920]   during the NCAA championships in Indianapolis.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.120]   She was expected to win.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:16.760]   Ormsby, 21, jogged away from the stadium
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.240]   while in eighth place in the women's 10,000 meter race,
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.200]   she was favored to win.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.760]   And she jumped off a bridge two blocks away,
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.880]   suffering multiple spinal fractures.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.400]   She left the race with 3,400 meters to go.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.240]   I mean, I read that.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.360]   I didn't have a category for this.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.760]   Even though I had come to understand
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.760]   that there was a God that was out there that loved me,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.760]   I didn't--
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.280]   I just-- I thought, well, come on, man.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.200]   God, I'm glad you love me.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.960]   I'm glad you're thou shalls or really because I love you.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.320]   I want you to know.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.840]   But man, Kathy Ormsby, God, I mean, she--
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.720]   that girl is popular.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.280]   That girl is famous.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.320]   That girl is set up for the future.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.360]   That girl is brilliant.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.640]   And she did what?
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:07.200]   What Kathy Ormsby did is she came to the end of her idols.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.160]   What Kathy Ormsby did is she realized that--
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.560]   that the gods that she was serving were no gods at all.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.280]   Now, what's really interesting is Kathy Ormsby
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.600]   said all she wanted to do with her life was to please God.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.640]   But here's the thing.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.400]   She didn't understand the God who was pleased with her.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.600]   She had in her mind's eye that if she didn't get great grades,
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.000]   if she didn't perform really well,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.400]   if she wasn't going to always do the next amazing, most record
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.160]   setting thing, that she was disappointing God,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.400]   disappointing others.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.840]   And she was haunted by that.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:54.280]   It's a phrase that I've often quoted.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.640]   The phrase goes like this.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.160]   It says, "The rich are infinitely better off
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.820]   than the poor.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.280]   Because while the poor still think
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.740]   that money will buy them happiness, the rich know better."
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:11.560]   When I read that article, I thought,
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.720]   Kathy Ormsby is infinitely better off than me.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.560]   See, in my athletic career, things
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.000]   happen that it didn't tend to fully trend the exact same way
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.360]   that Kathy's did.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.280]   And it's just a fact that the girl in this room that
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.080]   wears that little size 2 dress, that has that long, flowing
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.160]   hair she never has to comb, whose complexion is just
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.880]   something, whose body is just shaped like it came right
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.640]   of a Lululemon catalog, who just has it all,
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.080]   she is infinitely better off than you who are frumpy.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.560]   Because while you who come in this room look in a mirror
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.040]   and don't like what you see, that girl who looks in a mirror
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.500]   and sees what all the world says is going to make you happy,
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.560]   she knows better.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:02.400]   That girl that's got a great boyfriend that's on her way,
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.960]   you know, maybe to having a big day where everybody celebrates
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.560]   her and focuses on her, and she's the bride,
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.520]   she's infinitely better off than some of you guys that
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.440]   have never had a date.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.640]   Because while some of you think, if I could just
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.640]   get a guy to love me and pursue me,
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.400]   the girl who's already been down that road
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.560]   is starting to think, God, there's
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.840]   got to be a little bit more than this.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.400]   I know we shared here, Tom Brady,
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.800]   after he won his third Super Bowl.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.280]   He's 27 years old.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.280]   60 minutes devoted an entire segment to him.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.680]   And I just said, Tom, man, you know, you've got it all.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.320]   It's all breaking your way.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.880]   I quote.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.440]   He says, I got to tell you this.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.040]   I don't know why I had three Super Bowl rings.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.960]   And I still feel like there's something out there that's
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.760]   greater than this.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.480]   There has to be.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.600]   And a lot of people say, hey, man, hey, Tom,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   this is what it is, man.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.200]   You've reached your goal, your dream.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.560]   Your life has got it made.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   And he goes, me?
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.640]   I think, God, there's got to be more than this.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.840]   And then the interviewer said, well, what is it?
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.840]   What do you think it is?
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.200]   He goes, God, I wish I knew.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.080]   God, I wish I knew.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:07.840]   See, when you come across Tom Brady,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.880]   when you come across Kathy Ormsby,
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.960]   and you still see them who have experienced what you have--
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.520]   this last week on Saturday night,
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.880]   I did the chapel for the Kansas City Chiefs.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.600]   I'm sitting there with these guys, and I'm talking to them.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.840]   And I could go right after them with this, you see?
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.640]   Because those guys have made it where
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.840]   every guy that's ever strapped on a helmet,
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.920]   ever boiled a mouthpiece, it's where they want to go.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.920]   They want to be in that room.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.520]   They want to be a guy that's a part of the NFL.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.000]   And they are infinitely better off
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.320]   than some of you guys that are still
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.880]   exaggerating to the girls in this room
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.960]   about how great you were in high school.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.480]   And if it weren't for an injury, you'd
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.720]   have been probably there, too.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:52.760]   Because you think, man, if you just had that NFL alumni
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.840]   card in your pocket, then you'd have something.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.800]   Those guys know better.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.120]   Guess who else knows better?
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.580]   The one who says, hey, man, I don't
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.120]   mind if you break NCAA records.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.840]   I love that you get good grades and use the mind.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.300]   I've given you the fullness of your potential.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.160]   You ought to take care of your body
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.720]   and have it be as useful and functioning and healthy
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.880]   and beautiful as it can be.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.800]   But man, if you worship at that tree,
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.880]   it's not going to go well for you.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.520]   Hey, man, if you've got what it takes to make it in the league,
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.680]   that's great, man.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.100]   But if that's your God, it's just
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.000]   not going to serve you well.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.200]   Can I give you another point?
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.200]   Let me just give you this point.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.540]   God always wants to give you everything
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.820]   you would have asked for if you knew everything he knows.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:50.500]   When you hear thou shalt, he is not doing anything other
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:54.640]   but saying, because I love you, I want you to know this.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.220]   Guys, this statement is so true.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:06.520]   And it's just that what we think about when we think about God
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.680]   is the singular most important thing about us.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.560]   And here's the deal, man.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.880]   There's a liar, and all he wants to do
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.360]   is tell you that God doesn't have your best interest
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:17.860]   in mind.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.960]   Thou shalt is a burden.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.640]   Thou shalt is a beating.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.400]   In fact, if you went and studied Satanism, you don't have to.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.860]   I'm going to just kind of summarize it for you right here.
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.280]   You ready for Satanism for idiots?
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.640]   Here it comes, OK?
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.720]   You could sum up the entire Satanic Bible
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.920]   with what is commonly called the Thelemic Law.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:45.160]   That means in Greek, will or intention.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.920]   And here it comes.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.200]   Do what thou wilt. Hey, do whatever you want, man.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   And the reason you've got to do whatever you want
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.160]   is because God, he doesn't have your best interest in mind.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.320]   God isn't good.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.440]   His word's not true.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.600]   And disobeying him is not that big a deal.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.480]   Do whatever you want.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:09.880]   Bible says you can do whatever you want,
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.520]   but I'm just going to tell you that's the way of death.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.160]   There's no life there.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.080]   God always wants to give you everything
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.400]   he would ask for if you know everything that he knew.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:30.120]   This is what it says in Exodus chapter 20.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.120]   Says in verses 1 through 7, "Then God
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.200]   spoke all these words."
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.600]   Again, right now, what you thought
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.120]   about when I told you who spoke this
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.720]   is the most important thing about you.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.960]   We spent a whole week on it last week.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.400]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.240]   Whether you want me to be or not, I am.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.640]   So that's just not up for debate.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.960]   Now, you can reject it.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.240]   You can fight against me.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.040]   You can make me out to be what I'm not.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.240]   You can compare me to your old man who was abusive
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.160]   and abandoned you.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.320]   Or you can listen to me.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.360]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.940]   And now here's what he's going to say.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.560]   Who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.400]   We talked about this last week.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.200]   I mean, what God's trying to say is, listen,
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.800]   I'm not here to put you into bondage.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.040]   I am here to set you free.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.440]   I like to say it this way.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.320]   God isn't looking to catch you in your sin.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.880]   He is looking to free you from the sin
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.660]   that has captured you.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:28.760]   Now, I don't know what you think of God is up there
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.440]   and he's telling you, "Hey man, thou shalt.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.420]   "And if you don't, I'm gonna catch you."
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.360]   No, that's not what he's gonna say.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.320]   What he's saying is, listen, thou shalt,
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.920]   because I love you, I want you to know this.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.200]   That if you don't do these things,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.480]   you're gonna be captured and enslaved
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.360]   to various lusts and pleasures.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.920]   You might even have some success.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.040]   You might get good grades.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.880]   You might be beautiful.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.280]   You might have an NFL alumni card.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.880]   You might be beautiful.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.920]   You might have some ecstatic, emotional,
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.720]   and physical experiences.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.560]   But you're not gonna have what you're looking for.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:10.680]   There's a great line by a guy that had his own level
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.200]   of academic success and was a great philosopher and writer.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.220]   He said this, "If we find ourselves with the desire
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.280]   "that nothing in this world can satisfy,"
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.740]   see Cathy Ormsby, see Tom Brady, see Todd Wagner.
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.960]   "The most probable explanation is that we were made
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.820]   "for another world.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.700]   "If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it,
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.500]   "that doesn't prove that the universe is a fraud.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.560]   "Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it,
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.020]   "but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.260]   "If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.380]   "never to despise or to be unthankful for
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.400]   "the earthly blessings that I have."
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.360]   In other words, earthly blessings hearken
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.520]   to fullness of life.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.680]   They are a whisper of the satisfaction that is to come.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.660]   But watch this, "But I also must never make the mistake
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.920]   "to mistake them for something else
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.560]   "of which they are only a kind of copy
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.400]   "or an echo or a mirage.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.740]   "I must keep myself alive to the desire of my true country,
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.120]   "which I shall not find till after death."
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.640]   Now here's the thing, when God says, "Thou shalt,"
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.320]   what he's trying to do is to direct you
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.680]   back towards his kingdom's way.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.880]   You were born a rebel in a rebel world,
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.440]   and the world keeps going away that seems right to them,
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.840]   but it's the way of death.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.720]   Let me just give you one of the ways of the world.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.160]   Here's one of the ways of the world.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.640]   When the world doesn't think about God correctly,
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.040]   they are filled with anxiety and despair.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.440]   When somebody's filled with anxiety or despair,
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.160]   we put them on meds.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.200]   And we just try and numb them from their pain.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   And then we tweak meds the rest of their days.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.440]   And sometimes their meds don't do what needs to be done,
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.380]   and they beat their wife and abuse their child.
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.040]   And sometimes that doesn't satisfy their anger
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.860]   and their need to lash out in pain,
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.720]   and so they grab a gun and they kill as many as they can
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.680]   in a town not far from where they live.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.640]   You see, there's another way.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.400]   And God is trying to help us and bring us to it.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.300]   He loves us, and he wants us to know there is a better way.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:27.320]   In Exodus 20, you guys need to understand
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.400]   that little verse right there in verse two,
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.000]   he says, "I brought you out of the land of Egypt."
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.560]   What God is telling him is,
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.400]   I'm about to tell you how to operate with me.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.680]   And I am good.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.880]   You were slaves.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.820]   You had nothing.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.580]   You were being abused.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.320]   And you were sick and tired of being sick and tired,
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.340]   and so you cried out to me for a deliverer.
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.920]   And in my grace, I brought you one.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:59.240]   And now, you have come to know that I am the one true God.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.720]   So you may not know much about Exodus 1 through 19,
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.040]   but let me summarize it for you.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.400]   There was a group of people that were slaves,
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.960]   that were abused, that were oppressed,
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.840]   that lived in a land where there were a multitude of gods,
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.580]   and those gods had been thoroughly mocked.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.880]   They were proven to not be gods at all.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.160]   The god of the Nile turned to blood.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.880]   The god of frogs multiplied to the point of nuisance.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.880]   Lice, gnats, flies, on and on and on and on.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.480]   The god of the sky tortured them.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   Every plague that happened in Exodus 1 through 19
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:40.280]   was a plague that mocked and took the gods of Egypt,
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.880]   the only gods the world knew that must be great
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.200]   because Egypt was the most powerful nation on earth,
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.360]   and absolutely brought sadness through them.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.160]   God was showing there is no other god but me,
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.320]   and that is exactly what Moses tried to tell
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.380]   not just the Jews, but even Egypt.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.440]   And he was telling Pharaoh, "Pharaoh, look, man,
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.800]   "you got a lot of power.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.360]   "I'm glad you're Cathy Ormsby right now.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.540]   "I'm glad you got your Pharaoh alumni card in your pocket.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.500]   "But there's no life there for long,
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.520]   "because you must do business with me,
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.480]   "and I'm going to show you myself."
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.480]   And God showed the idols of Egypt were vain idols.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.640]   And the people of Israel were set free
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.240]   from the bondage that they were in,
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.520]   and now God brought them out.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.360]   Here's a note.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.480]   The law was not given to redeem a people.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.760]   This is so important.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.680]   The law was given to a redeemed people.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.120]   God never gives us the law so that by the law,
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.560]   we might be set free.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.120]   God shows us that he is good, and then he says, "Thou shall."
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.640]   I love you.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.240]   I have done for you what you can't do for yourself.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.260]   If you want to continue to have a great life,
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.720]   don't do what you yourself want to do
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.520]   because you're a rebel boy in a rebel land.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.440]   But by faith, you can trust in me,
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.140]   and not how you feel, and not what the world offers,
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.100]   and it will bless you.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.960]   Do you know what happens at the end of the Old Testament?
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.380]   The very first words that God on earth speaks
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.600]   are these words, "Blessed."
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.400]   You know what that word means?
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.220]   It means happy.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.060]   You want to be happy?
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:17.880]   Be poor in spirit.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.720]   Don't be arrogant.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.320]   Don't tell me where you're gonna find life.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.160]   You're not gonna find life in those things.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.640]   It's okay if you have relationships.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.000]   I want you to have relationships.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.880]   Here's how to have relationships at work.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.360]   Thou shall do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.720]   Thou shall not treat each other like sex toys.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.440]   Thou shall, and on and on he goes,
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.180]   because he goes, "I don't want you to have moments
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.960]   "where you're pleased, but then you have poison
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.980]   "that ultimately breaks down your world
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.760]   "and the society of which you live."
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.300]   I love you.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.520]   And God never tells you what to do
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.400]   until he's told you who he is.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.440]   He starts by giving you a resume.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.200]   I'm the God that set you free
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.760]   and brought you out of bondage.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.720]   Romans 8, 32 says this.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.080]   He who did not spare his own son,
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.280]   but delivered him up for us all,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.400]   how will he not also with him freely give us all things?
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.440]   The argument of Paul is, hey, this God
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:18.020]   that brought us out of Egypt, of slavery and of judgment,
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.200]   if God will die for us, if that's his son
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.000]   and he demonstrated his love for me
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.020]   by dying on the cross, won't he thou shall me
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.280]   to other great things?
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.200]   Why wouldn't I listen to that God?
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.680]   And so with that as the setup, guys,
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   we move to verse three.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.400]   And here's what verse three says.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.520]   It says, "You shall, thou shall
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.960]   "have no other gods before me."
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.800]   Why?
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.480]   Because what you think about when you think about God
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.040]   is the most important thing about you.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.000]   God is only concerned with one thing.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.840]   He's only concerned with one thing.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.940]   By the way, do you know why Jesus died on the cross?
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.520]   It's not because he loves you.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.760]   That's a secondary benefit.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.520]   It's a secondary reason.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.080]   The primary reason that God died on the cross
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.920]   is because he is holy and the wages of sin is death.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.300]   And because God is love, he has to do
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.960]   what love demands that he does,
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.480]   and so love demands that he saves,
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.040]   but he's just and he can't save wicked people.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.200]   So he had to appease his own eternal perfection
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.720]   by offering an eternally perfect sacrifice.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.720]   There's not a lot of those laying around.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.200]   Enter the son of God,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.240]   who does for you what cannot be done.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.440]   It's not until Jesus demonstrates his love
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.180]   that he says, "Hey man, follow me."
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.160]   That's why Jesus came and reversed
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.400]   some of the effects of the fall.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.660]   He would find lame people,
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.980]   which there was no lameness prior to us abandoning God.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.520]   There was no sickness or death prior to us abandoning God.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.200]   And what he does is he shows he has the power
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.240]   to reverse the effects of the curse.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.480]   Who can do that except the one that is more powerful
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.600]   than the one that brought the curse?
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.920]   But God ultimately had to make sure
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.720]   that the payment was made.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.960]   And so in order to establish his glory
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.680]   and to satisfy his justice,
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.140]   he demonstrated his holiness on a cross.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.280]   And in the demonstration of his holiness
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.320]   for the purpose of saving you and me,
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.160]   we saw the demonstration of his love.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.320]   And so he says, "Thou shalt."
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.220]   Thou shalt follow the God
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.280]   that has your best interest in mind,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.040]   not the one who offers you
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.120]   what appears to be life-giving but is death.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.200]   This is an illustration that whenever I give it,
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.040]   it kind of makes it,
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:37.860]   I'll tell you a little bit.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.080]   It's an illustration that talks about how wolves
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.120]   would deal with, how Eskimos would deal with wolves
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.640]   that are ransacking and destroying their community.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.480]   Do you know how they do that?
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.880]   What they do is they take a blade of,
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.560]   they take a very sharp knife and they slaughter an animal,
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.080]   okay, a beast of burden or an animal that they eat,
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.280]   and they dip it in that blood
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.680]   and they tie it to a stick in the ice
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.360]   and they let it freeze and they dip it in blood again
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.720]   and they do it again and again and again,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.440]   let it freezing, layers and layers and layers
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.200]   and layers of blood until you've got a frozen blood popsicle
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.200]   outside a knife blade, a very sharp knife blade.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.120]   And then they'll take that and several others like them
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.600]   and they'll dip them one more time in flesh blood
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.040]   and they will go just outside their village
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.840]   and they will stick them in the ice.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.400]   And then the scent comes to the wolves.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.000]   And they hear there's blood there,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.880]   it's easy prey and they will come and they will go
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.800]   and what do they find?
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.900]   I'll be dag numb, a blood popsicle.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.580]   Now what happens when you start to lick the warm blood
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.620]   and underneath it, your warm tongue is melting
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.860]   the very next layer of frozen blood,
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.200]   so you get more and more blood,
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.900]   you're working yourself into a frenzy
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.600]   where as you are melting the frozen layers of blood,
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.000]   what's happening to your tongue?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.920]   It's getting number and number and number
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.580]   until all of a sudden you lick through all the frozen blood
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.000]   and now you're licking the blade.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.720]   And what happens when you lick a blade with a numb tongue?
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   You get more blood.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:09.080]   And you just sit there and you just are consumed
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.360]   in the lust of your flesh.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.280]   It sure seems life-giving.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.280]   And what the enemy who comes to steal, kill and destroy
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.320]   is doing is he's putting all kinds of little idols,
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.640]   all kinds of little blood popsicles out there for you
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.600]   and say, "Come and get it."
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.600]   And at first you're like, "This is awesome."
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   You're like, "Here's Ralph."
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.440]   Mine's really good, you know?
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.040]   And next thing you know,
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.480]   you're talking like a slurred wolf, all right?
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.680]   And next thing you know, you're laying there dead.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.120]   Doesn't that sound like lower Greenville?
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.400]   That sounds exactly like lower Greenville.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.580]   Y'all get in there, go, "How's it going, Ed?"
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.220]   What did J.P. call it?
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.340]   Two-time Tuesday, whatever it was he called.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.180]   I don't know.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.260]   He's a two-time scoundrel 'til he found the Lord.
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.100]   That's what I know.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.660]   Look, here's the thing, man.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.500]   I wanna say it again.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.860]   The law wasn't given to redeem you.
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.820]   The law was given to those that are already redeemed.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.980]   That's what the scripture says, by the way.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.580]   Let me just read it to you, Romans 3:20.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.740]   "The works of the law were never there
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.820]   "in order that you might be justified."
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.700]   No, no, no.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.700]   The law was there to show you that sin is real.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.740]   And God's just saying, "Now look, here's the deal.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.280]   "I'm holy, I don't jack around with what's not good
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.100]   "and true and beautiful and right.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.220]   "This is not good and true and beautiful and right.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.240]   "So stay away from it,
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.040]   "because I know it looks life-giving.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.960]   "I know it's a popsicle, but it's gonna numb you
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.300]   "and it will destroy you.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.300]   "Thou shall not lick blood popsicles."
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.680]   All God's saying to Israel,
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.820]   all He's saying to you and me is,
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.920]   "If you wanna get warm, man,
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.520]   "you gotta stand near the fire.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.340]   "If you want peace, if you want joy, if you want life,
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:01.340]   "you've gotta get close and stay close to where life is."
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.580]   And He's just showing you, "I'm where life is."
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.600]   That was bondage, false God's bondage.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.780]   By the way, what happened in Egypt?
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.600]   When you first got to Egypt, it was all,
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.920]   "Hey, man, you guys are awesome.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.340]   "There are people from your tribe
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.300]   "that are telling us about the trouble that is to come.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.240]   "Man, we love you, we bless you, we're jealous of you.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.540]   "You're gonna be slaves."
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.340]   Right?
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.180]   Now watch this, I mentioned the word jealous,
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.380]   let's just deal with it.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.860]   Second command, "Because I love you,
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.720]   "I don't want you to make yourself an idol
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.520]   "or any likeness of what is in heaven above
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.860]   "or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.660]   "You shall not worship them or serve them
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.900]   "for I, the Lord, your God, am a jealous God."
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.740]   Oh, really?
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.540]   Here's the problem with that.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:49.260]   First Corinthians 13, four through seven says this,
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:54.260]   "Love is patient, love is kind, love is not jealous."
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.900]   I thought God was love.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.060]   I mean, first John 4, it says God is love.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.180]   And then in first Corinthians 13, four,
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.140]   it says love is patient, love is kind,
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.920]   love is not jealous, does not brag.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.500]   I thought, Todd, you said the only thing
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.580]   God was really concerned about was His glory.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.100]   All He wants to do is make His glory known.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.860]   That's what He's really about.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.940]   Here's the deal, follow me.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.180]   There's two kinds of jealousy.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.260]   There's the kind of jealousy that exists
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.380]   when you have a feeling of resentment for another person
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.940]   because of their success or their happiness
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.300]   or their accomplishments or the advantage they have over you.
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:31.300]   That is a jealousy that is one that will make you covetous.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.620]   Like if I had what they had, what Kathy had,
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.060]   what Tyreek Hill had, what Dak has, I'd be happy.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.360]   And I'm jealous of their success
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.400]   or I'm jealous of their relationship
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.300]   or the attention they get.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.980]   There's another way that jealousy can be used though.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.100]   Jealousy is not just used about resentment
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.740]   towards somebody who has what you think
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.600]   would give you life if you had it.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.180]   It can also be an intolerance of unfaithfulness
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.860]   or of anything which threatens what is beautiful.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.660]   And that is what it means in Exodus 20
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:12.140]   when it says that God is jealous for you.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.780]   He doesn't want you to lick blood popsicles.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.860]   He wants you to find life in deed.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.220]   You see, this is how you can know
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.340]   if you've got a God-like jealousy
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.380]   is if you see somebody truly happy, if you rejoice.
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.580]   Or if you're like, I don't want you to be happy
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.200]   unless it makes me happy.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.280]   See, God's not like that.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.780]   What God says, and here's the deal,
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.060]   God is consumed.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.320]   Love is not arrogant and does not boast.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.560]   All God does is he says, look at me, look who I am,
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.400]   look who I am.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.700]   Now why is God saying that?
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.700]   It's not because he's insecure
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.620]   and he doesn't need you to affirm who he is.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.540]   He knows who he is.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:50.540]   He's unchanging.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.360]   What God's trying to let you do is see him
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.040]   because he knows if you see him
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.100]   that he is the one who delivers you from bondage.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.980]   He's the one that gives good things
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.260]   in whom there is no variance or shifting shadow.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.940]   You're going to want more of him
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.280]   and because he is life and light and love,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.240]   you will then get what you can only get
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.700]   when you cozy up to him.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.040]   Do you see that?
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.400]   God is not trying to establish his glory.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.080]   God is trying to reveal his glory.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.360]   What sin is is trying to numb you
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.560]   from the reality of the pain that is coming.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.640]   He is a deceiver.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.760]   He tells you there's life over here
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.200]   when in the end it is death.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.900]   God says, "Die to your desires.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.480]   "Follow me and you'll find life."
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:42.680]   So when God says, "You shall have no other God
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.900]   "because there is no other God,"
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.000]   you're going to be making it up.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   You're going to serve a false God.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.240]   False gods don't deliver you.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.360]   False gods lead to what happened to Egypt.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.340]   Don't make idols.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.380]   Idols don't give life.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.320]   I give life.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.120]   There is no warmth besides that which is not a fire.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.100]   And here's the truth of who I am.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.420]   There's going to be consequences.
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.640]   I mean, I'm a good and gracious God.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.020]   I'm patient and I'm kind.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.740]   But sooner or later I'm going to let you have
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.900]   what you want if you want it
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:10.300]   because what God does is when you commit the only sin
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.500]   that really matters to God,
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.580]   in fact there's only one sin in the Bible
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:17.760]   that really matters, it's a primary sin.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.660]   Everything else is not even so much a secondary sin.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.980]   It's a judgment which ultimately comes
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.240]   because of the primary sin.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.540]   What's the primary sin?
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.100]   When you reject the kindness, the goodness,
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.980]   and the love of the Father.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:36.980]   And you make him out to be impetuous or needy or oppressive
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.180]   and therefore you give yourself permission
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.660]   to not serve him or want him or to follow him.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.780]   Here's the truth.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.000]   Most of us don't struggle with the idea that God exists.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.020]   Every time we sin, all we're doing is confessing,
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.300]   I don't think you're good.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.540]   And I think when you say thou shalt, the enemy's right,
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.300]   that you're not good, your word's not true,
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.380]   and disobeying you is not that big a deal.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.260]   And because he's patient,
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.180]   it's always not that big a deal right away.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.900]   But do not be deceived, God is not mocked.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.700]   Let me just read you an amazing little section of scripture.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.520]   It comes in Psalm 106.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.980]   This is what it says, Psalm 106.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.180]   Praise the Lord.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.700]   In other words, this is the most important thing.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.720]   Start by reminding yourself, oh give thanks to the Lord
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.060]   for he is good.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.460]   God's loving kindness is everlasting, it never stops.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.340]   There is no variance, no shifting shadow.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.100]   Who can speak in the mighty deeds of the Lord?
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.900]   You know why we come together and gather corporately?
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.660]   Man, to remind ourself God is good.
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.500]   Because when you get out there,
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.300]   the world starts to say, he's not that good.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.260]   He doesn't have your best interest in mind.
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.220]   Look at the mirror.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.100]   Look at your job.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.620]   What about your family of origin?
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.580]   What about that doctor's diagnosis?
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:53.020]   Who can speak in the mighty deeds of the Lord?
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.140]   Who can show forth all his praise?
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.580]   How blessed are those who keep justice,
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.600]   who practice righteousness at all times?
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.480]   All he's saying is those who know that thou shall
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.280]   is better understood is because God loves you
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.120]   and he's perfect.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.160]   Verse four, remember me, oh Lord,
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.240]   in your favor towards your people.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.860]   Visit me with your salvation,
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.120]   that I might see the prosperity of your chosen ones
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.660]   that walk in the way of life,
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.920]   that I might rejoice in the gladness of your nation,
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.500]   that I might glory with your inheritance.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.120]   Some of you guys have been here longer
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.460]   and there is a rejoicing happening here at the porch
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.300]   of the nation of the redeemed millennials of Dallas, Texas,
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.280]   and Houston, and Fort Worth, and Joplin, and Tulsa,
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.380]   and all the other places.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.540]   And there's something going on where you guys are going,
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.420]   this is the life.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.900]   And there is a redeemed nation that's happening here
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.180]   among you, watch this.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:45.380]   Verse six, Lord, we have sinned like our fathers.
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.600]   We've committed iniquity.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.580]   We've behaved wickedly.
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.940]   Our fathers in Egypt didn't understand your wonders.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.660]   They did not remember your abundant kindness.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.820]   I mean, they weren't out of Egypt for a day
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.180]   and they started to say that you're a bad God to follow
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.260]   'cause it didn't look like there's any way
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.220]   you could deliver them from the next obstacle they faced.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.380]   Even though you just plundered
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.940]   the most powerful nation on earth,
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.440]   there's a stinking Red Sea, and here comes that nation,
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.920]   and now they're angry.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.680]   But you saved them for the sake of your name.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.420]   That he might make his power known.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.100]   He rebuked the Red Sea, it dried up,
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.180]   and he led them through the deeps,
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.020]   it's through the wilderness.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.260]   So he saved them from the hand of the one who hated them.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.140]   And he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.380]   The waters covered their adversaries.
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.700]   Not one of them was left.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.100]   And so then they believed his words.
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.020]   Then they had a worship service.
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.120]   They go, what were we thinking?
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.820]   God is good, let's remind ourself of this.
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:37.680]   But man, does this sound like you?
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:43.080]   By Wednesday afternoon, they forgot his works.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.860]   They didn't wait for his counsel.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.360]   Hey, Lord, what shall we do?
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:53.060]   This good God who delivers us, what shall we do?
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.640]   But they craved intensely for what their flesh wanted
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.100]   and made sense in the wilderness,
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.500]   and they tempted God in the desert.
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.860]   So watch this, here goes verse 15.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.660]   So he gave them their request.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.900]   Blood popsicles for everybody.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.880]   I wouldn't eat the blood popsicle.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.820]   Thou shall not eat blood popsicles.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.700]   The more you do it, the more you think
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.900]   it's not causing you problems,
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.460]   because the sentence, Ecclesiastes 8, 11 says,
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.660]   against an evil deed is not executed quickly,
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.420]   therefore the hearts of men among them
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.500]   suck harder on blood popsicles.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.700]   It's a loose paraphrase.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:33.140]   And they get numb, their conscience gets seared,
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.060]   and next thing you know, they go,
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.060]   I think I'm getting away from this.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.960]   There's no God, what a joke.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.100]   Bring on the party.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.600]   And their tongue rages against the Lord.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:46.340]   But then it says in verse 15,
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.700]   but he sent a wasting disease among them.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.420]   If you've got a Bible with a little number there,
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.220]   a margin note, the literal translation is
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:56.140]   he sent leanness to their soul.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.460]   Man, if there is not a beautiful description
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.620]   of what it really means to be an individual
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.800]   that is experiencing everything that the world says
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.720]   you should get so that you can be happy,
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.180]   and you've got it, and you're being interviewed
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.500]   by Steve Croft on 60 Minutes, and you just go,
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.940]   I don't know, man, there's a leanness in my soul.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:25.460]   There's gotta be more than this,
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.300]   and I just don't know what it is.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:31.580]   Thou shalt.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.300]   Thou shalt have no other God before him,
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.700]   because he's the one true living God,
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.260]   and you're not going to find the life and the love
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.060]   and the light that you're looking for
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.180]   if you go anywhere else.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.500]   I started this thing by talking a little bit
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.340]   about mental illness.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.160]   Let me just end with this.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.940]   It's a very familiar verse, but I want you to see
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.620]   why God is telling you thou shalt.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.340]   It's Romans chapter 12, verse one, and here's the deal,
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.260]   guys, to summarize basically where we just were,
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.100]   here's the thing.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.740]   You can pretend that there is no God for a while,
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.660]   but you won't be able to deny his word is true
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.020]   after a while.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.980]   That leanness of your soul will get you.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.500]   And some of you guys, in your arrogance,
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.780]   you might say, "Well, I don't feel lean, man.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.900]   "I'm high on the hog right now.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.860]   "That abortion, that doesn't bother me.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.280]   "That sleeping around, I feel a little guilty,
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.060]   "but it also feels really good.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.700]   "Dallas has given me enough, man.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.220]   "I'm doing good, I'm doing good."
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.380]   If you like what you got, keep doing what you're doing.
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.460]   I'm going to warn you, if you keep doing what you're doing,
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.740]   you're not going to like what you got.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.860]   And God is patient, and he is kind, but he is jealous.
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:41.820]   And just because the sentence against your little evil deed
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.780]   is not executed quickly, don't think for a second, Pharaoh,
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.020]   king of your own little Egypt, don't think for a second
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.900]   that you're going to mock him for long.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.260]   And God's not mad at you, man.
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.300]   He's not mad at you.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.740]   You're going to eventually experience
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.100]   that leanness to your soul.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.260]   And so, he's just over there saying,
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.220]   "Hey, man, come on home."
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:08.440]   Romans 1 through 11 is all about the love of God,
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.940]   delivering you out of the bondage and slavery
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.100]   to sin and the flesh.
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:11.940]   You don't have to be there.
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:12.780]   He's shown you who he is.
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.140]   He's demonstrated his love for you,
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.980]   and that while you're still sinners, Christ died for you.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:20.540]   "Therefore, thou shalt, I urge you, because I love you,
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:24.000]   "brothers and sisters, by the mercy of God,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.380]   "who wants you to know how good he is.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.700]   "I want you to present your bodies
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.500]   "as living and holy sacrifices, acceptable to God,
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.780]   "which is the right thing to do
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.020]   "when you see how good and wonderful God is.
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.440]   "You would run to him if you saw the glory of God,
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.440]   "if you knew that every good thing came from him,
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.120]   "and no good thing does he withhold
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.200]   "from those who love him.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.600]   "And in his presence is fullness of joy,
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.680]   "and his right hand are pleasures forever.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.600]   "You would go, I'm in, I'm running to you.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.320]   "So you will not be conformed to the flesh and to the world,
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.540]   "but you will be continually transformed
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.240]   "as your mind is changed.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.960]   "You're no longer gonna be mentally ill."
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:04.960]   This is mental illness.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:05.800]   God isn't good.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.920]   His word's not true.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.600]   Disobeying him's not that big a deal.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.220]   That is mental illness.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.960]   And because of that,
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.360]   we abandon each other and families and relationships.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.420]   We numb ourself with drugs and medication.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.080]   We try and find life in the world.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.080]   We come from families where there's dysfunction,
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.980]   and it messes with us, and it turns into a brain illness.
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:27.440]   But why does God say this?
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.800]   He says this so that you may prove,
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.620]   come, come and listen to my vows, shalls,
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.000]   so that you can prove with your own life
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.480]   the sweetness of God's way,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.280]   so you can live righteously among the nations
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   and testify to them that God's way is good,
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.480]   so that you, not by being good, can prove that you're good.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.660]   That's not what it says.
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:52.040]   It says so you can experience what is good and acceptable
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.240]   and perfect to the soul of man and woman.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.400]   Guys, I'll close with this.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.480]   I have known him now for 30-some-odd years,
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.880]   and I have never one time, I got nothing,
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.820]   I'm getting nothing from you for telling you this,
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.740]   except there's never been one time
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:10.580]   that I have followed in the goodness of the Lord's way
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.580]   that I have regretted it.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.700]   I've missed out on sexual ecstasy for a season.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:19.320]   I've missed out on opportunities to titillate my flesh,
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.700]   feather my bed, increase my worldly comfort.
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:27.120]   But I can't tell you how many people
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.920]   with more sexual relationships than I've ever had,
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.480]   more money than I'll ever make,
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.860]   more comfort than I could ever attain to,
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.100]   are sitting at me and they go,
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.140]   "Bro, you got what I don't got.
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.500]   "There's a leanness in my soul that I don't see in you."
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.420]   And I go, "I know, because for some crazy reason,
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.860]   "God has let me see that thou shalt,"
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.980]   means, Todd, because I love you,
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.100]   come over here and be warmed by the glory of who I am.
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.980]   And I don't care what you've done
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.580]   or how long you've done it or how numb your tongue is,
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.560]   come on back, man.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.360]   Get your numb conscience and get your frozen tongue
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.900]   thawed out by the fire of God's love.
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.920]   I'd love to have you here,
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.560]   'cause just like I've been forgiven,
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.180]   his forgiveness is for you.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.100]   Come on and show others the goodness of God's way.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.800]   Who wants some?
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.360]   Let's go, people.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.480]   There's a world desperate to know the truth.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.760]   Father, I pray
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.760]   that truth would come from this room right here,
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:36.000]   and men and women would walk out of this room tonight
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.560]   and the rooms that we're in, we're broadcasting to,
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.160]   and they would just be heralds, Lord, of your goodness.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.700]   They would sing your song.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.860]   They would be Psalm 116 people,
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.320]   not just in this next moment,
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.320]   but Psalm 116, 106 people that would say,
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.280]   "Praise the Lord, for he is good
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.940]   "in all his ways of peace.
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.240]   "With God, there is no variance or shifting shadow
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.800]   "and even though there are hard days,
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.400]   "we have trouble in the midst of them,
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.500]   "and he's gonna make it right,
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.420]   "and until then, we see that he has made us righteous
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.100]   "through the sacrifice of his Son.
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.740]   "Lord, thank you that you're thou shalt are
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:11.860]   "because I love you.
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.820]   "Give us the faith to walk in them.
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.080]   "Lord, you don't give us a law to redeem us.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.120]   "You give us the law of truth
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.640]   "that we might experience a restoration of the soul,
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.340]   "an enlightenment of the eyes,
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:28.020]   "that you might give us lives that are clean,
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:31.080]   "that are free from the disease of sin.
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.400]   "And so, Lord, we bow our hearts and we bend our knees,
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.820]   "and we say, you are good and you are holy.
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.620]   "We recognize you for who you are,
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.500]   "and we say, let us walk in your ways
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.140]   "because we believe there is life there."
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.740]   If there is anybody in this room
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:52.080]   that has not ever acknowledged your goodness
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.260]   and that has been living in a way
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.740]   that is a testimony to that,
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.740]   I pray during this moment they would just repent,
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.880]   they'd come home, they'd just say,
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.820]   "Lord, if you're there and you're good, I wanna know you.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.440]   "If it's true that you can lead me out of the bondage
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.460]   "of sin, I want peace."
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.740]   And those of us that know, let us sing,
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.560]   and let our lives sing all week long.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:16.020]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:16.860]   Thank you.
