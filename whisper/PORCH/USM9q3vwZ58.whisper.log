[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:25.560]   What's up, Porch?
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.160]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.640]   Hey, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.400]   If this is your first time ever at the Porch,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.560]   my name's Timothy Atik.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.600]   I'm one of the teaching pastors here at the Porch,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.480]   as well as on Sunday mornings.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.960]   I'm so glad that you made it if this is your first time.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.600]   I hope that Tuesday nights feels like home quickly for you.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.400]   There's a QR code that's going to go on the screen.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.080]   We'd love to connect with you.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.000]   If we can help make this place feel a little bit smaller
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.880]   and a little bit easier to connect at,
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.840]   then we would love to get in touch with you that way.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.520]   Also, I want to give a shout out to several Porch Live
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.320]   locations that are watching tonight
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.160]   in different parts of the nation.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.520]   Say hello to Porch Live Scottsdale.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.560]   And new to the mix, Porch Live Atlanta and Porch Live Daytona,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.040]   which is awesome.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.360]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.960]   We are so glad that you made it.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.960]   I want to start off tonight just by sharing something with you
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.480]   that is a little bit embarrassing for me to share,
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.920]   but I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.760]   I work from home a lot.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.960]   So any message that I write, I write from a rocking chair
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.000]   in my bedroom.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.720]   So this is me basically all day.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.560]   If you want to know how the magic happens,
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.240]   this is just me writing away every day.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.560]   But to my right, right next to my rocking chair,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.080]   is this lamp stand.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.840]   And it's a big circle with edges on it,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.800]   so it kind of catches a bunch of clutter.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.640]   And I was looking at it today, and I
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.320]   realized just how much junk had piled up on the table
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.200]   that I look at every single day.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.480]   So every single day, I sit down, and this
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.480]   is what is next to me.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.240]   I just pulled a bunch of things that
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.280]   have been sitting next to me for a long time.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.520]   This is a bag of pretzels from an American Airlines flight,
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.280]   which is just on the table.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.000]   This is some dental floss.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.480]   Now, here's what you need to know.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.440]   I floss with a passion.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.600]   Like, I love flossing.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.200]   Like, it brings me pride when I go to the dentist,
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.720]   and they're like, do you floss?
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.440]   I'm like, thank you so much for asking.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.040]   Let me change your life.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.800]   Do I floss?
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.160]   I'm passionate about flossing.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.880]   I floss all day, every day.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.400]   So that's just kind of--
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.920]   but here's what you need to know.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.760]   This floss, I don't use this floss
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.600]   because I'm a particular person.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.920]   I use this floss, which is also on the table.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.960]   So I floss as no longer in use.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.520]   Anyone want this floss?
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.800]   Yeah, right there.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.320]   There you go.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.720]   Knock yourself out.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.840]   It's not any good.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.040]   You're going to find that out quickly, because you want
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.520]   to use Glide, which we're sponsored here at The Porch
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.280]   by Glide Dental Floss.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.400]   You should check that out.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.240]   Also, I have a prescription that I don't use.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.280]   I have an inhaler that I don't use.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.680]   Anyone want-- no, we're not doing that.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.200]   I have a $2 bill that one of my kids
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.000]   gave me because he was paying me back for something
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.440]   I think he bought online.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.960]   And so he gave me a $2 bill to pay for it with.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.600]   I have a copy of a DVD of a movie
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.400]   that Watermark produced years ago.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.160]   And it's like a modern telling of the life of Joseph.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.120]   So that-- check that out.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.880]   I have a medal that a friend gave me.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.360]   And that's just a few of the things
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.120]   that sit next to me every day.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.600]   And I realized those things don't belong there.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.200]   And yet what has happened is I dropped them there
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.480]   at some point thinking they'll just be there temporarily.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.120]   And they've landed there permanently.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.480]   They've found a home.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.560]   And now I just act like they belong there.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.880]   So here's what I want you to do.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.760]   Some of you guys are neat freaks.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.200]   You're OCD, and you're freaking out right now.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.040]   Like just the thought of this, you're like,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.080]   please let me come over to your house
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.280]   and deal with that table.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   But some of you, here's what I want you to do.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   I want you to go and get in your car tonight
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.960]   and just look around.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.840]   Like look in the back seat.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.160]   Look in the trunk at the stuff that
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.900]   has just made itself at home.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.960]   And then I want you to go home to your apartment.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.920]   And I want you to look around the kitchen.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.640]   And then I want you to look at your room.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.120]   And here's what I want you to do.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.080]   I want you to find the things that have found a home that
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.320]   don't belong.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.760]   And then I want you to post about it
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.240]   and tag us so that we can see all the things in your life
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.840]   that have shown up that just don't belong.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.520]   The reason I tell you that is because we
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.520]   are stepping back into our series
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.680]   tonight on the Gospel of John.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.080]   And as we look at John chapter 2, what we are going to see
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.680]   is Jesus Christ is going to step into the temple, the house
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.720]   of God.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.880]   And he's going to notice some things that
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.400]   have made themselves at home that just don't
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.160]   belong in the house of God.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.900]   And so he is going to bat clean up.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.140]   And he is going to do something about the different things that
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.600]   have made themselves at home but shouldn't have.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.440]   So if you have a Bible, I want you
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.680]   to join me in John chapter 2.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.760]   And the reason that this passage is so important
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.520]   is because as we look at what Jesus deals
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.880]   with in the house of God, what it's going to prompt us to do
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.520]   is identify the things in the church
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.240]   and at the porch that might have made themselves at home
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.320]   but shouldn't have.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.000]   And then it's going to require us to look internally
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.840]   at our own lives individually and just ask the question,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.680]   what doesn't belong here?
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.400]   What in my life just needs to be cleaned out?
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.800]   So turn with me to John chapter 2.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.140]   Some of you guys are going to feel
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.800]   like this message is familiar.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.480]   It's because I gave this message at Awaken just a little over
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.200]   a year ago.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.440]   And I debated whether to just skip over this passage.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.720]   And I just sensed that God had us here,
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.680]   that this is a message for the people of God tonight,
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.040]   that God wants to do something in this place
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.480]   with this group of people, not just here in Dallas,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.440]   but in every place where people are watching online.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.160]   So here we go.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.320]   John chapter 2.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.480]   Let me read you verses 13 through 17
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.120]   so you get an idea of what's going on.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.880]   It says this, "The Passover of the Jews was at hand.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.520]   And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.560]   In the temple, he found those who
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.080]   were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons and the money changers
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.640]   sitting there.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.400]   And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.760]   of the temple with the sheep and the oxen.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.260]   And he poured out the coins of the money changers
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.880]   and overturned their tables.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.560]   And he told those who sold the pigeons,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.840]   take these things away.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.000]   Do not make my father's house a house of trade.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.440]   His disciples remembered that it was written, zeal for your house
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.960]   will consume me."
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.000]   And so this is a story that if you're
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.760]   familiar with Dude Perfect and you're
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.200]   familiar with the rage monster on Dude Perfect,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.640]   Jesus basically goes rage monster in the temple
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.760]   where he shows up and he sees a bunch of things
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.600]   that just drive him crazy.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.000]   And he does something about it.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.040]   Now, this is just a good rule to live by.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.080]   Anytime you're reading the Bible and you
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.680]   see Jesus express strong emotion,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:43.560]   like if you see Jesus weep, if you see Jesus express
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.720]   deep compassion, or if you see Jesus angry,
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.640]   take notice of it because what you are seeing
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.360]   is what Jesus Christ's heart beats for.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.200]   And so the fact that Jesus gets very angry,
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.320]   that should tell us that we should clue
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.640]   into what angers Jesus because what angers Jesus
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.720]   should anger us.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.000]   And that's a really interesting day
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.160]   when what angers Jesus actually is
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160]   completely comfortable for us.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.560]   We never want to be in that place.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.280]   And so here's what we're seeing in this passage.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.760]   What we see is that Jesus cares deeply about the temple.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.000]   And because Jesus cares deeply about the temple,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.120]   so should we.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.000]   And some of you are like, I have no clue
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.280]   what you're talking about.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.040]   What in the world do you mean that we should care deeply
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.760]   about the temple?
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.640]   Well, I want you to track with me
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.880]   because it actually is going to be very meaningful if you'll
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.840]   follow me and understand what we're talking about.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.440]   When we talk about the temple, what you need to understand
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.120]   is the temple is a theme from Genesis to Revelation
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.160]   in the Bible.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:05.480]   The temple is synonymous with the presence of God.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.280]   So for example, all the way back at the beginning
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.520]   of the Bible, Genesis, in the Garden of Eden,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:17.040]   the Garden of Eden was known as the Garden Temple.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.040]   And it's where God walked face to face
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.080]   with the first human beings.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.120]   But then sin entered the picture.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.200]   And man no longer got to relate to God by sight.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.120]   Man had to begin to relate to God by faith.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.080]   And yet God didn't abandon his plan
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.520]   to be present with his people.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.680]   And so what you see is God brings the nation of Israel
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.840]   out of Egypt.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.880]   And he tells them to build a tabernacle, which
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.640]   was a temporary housing structure for his presence.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.720]   God tells this to Moses in Exodus 25.8.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.560]   He says, "Let them make me a sanctuary."
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.400]   Why?
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.560]   "That I may dwell in their midst."
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.320]   So in Genesis, in the Garden Temple,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.600]   God's message to the first human beings is, "I'm here."
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.760]   He brings them out of Egypt.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.600]   He says, "I want you to build a tabernacle."
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.080]   They build the tabernacle.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.200]   And the presence of God fills the tabernacle.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.080]   And God's communication to the nation of Israel is, "I'm here."
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.960]   And then to Solomon.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.840]   Solomon builds the temple, which was
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.320]   a permanent structure for God.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.760]   1 Kings 8 says this, "When the priests came out
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.960]   of the holy place, a cloud filled the house of the Lord
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.540]   so that the priests could not stand to minister
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.480]   because of the cloud."
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.000]   Why?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.640]   "For the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord."
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.840]   So when I tell you that we should care about the temple,
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.360]   what I'm really telling you to do
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.400]   is to care about the presence of God.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:02.680]   So Jesus shows up, and he cleanses the temple.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.120]   What's interesting is in the book of Mark,
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.560]   which is a different telling of this story.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.640]   It says this in Mark 11:17.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.040]   "And he was teaching them, saying to them,
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.760]   'Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.000]   prayer for all nations, but you have made it a den of robbers'?"
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.120]   So if you're tuned out, tune in.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.000]   Here's the point.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.320]   I told you that Jesus cared deeply about the temple,
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.640]   and so should we.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.280]   What was the temple?
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.160]   The temple was the place where the presence of God resided.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.040]   The nation of Israel would come to the temple
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.480]   to meet with God.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.560]   Jesus said that the temple should be a house of prayer.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:39.880]   Why?
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.760]   Because the nation of Israel draws near to meet with God,
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.320]   to connect to God, to pray to God.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.400]   And yet, we find out a little bit more information in verse 13
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.080]   of chapter 2.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.960]   It says that the Passover of the Jews was at hand,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.160]   and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.880]   So follow me on this.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.240]   What's Passover?
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:12.280]   Passover was a nationwide holiday where the entire nation,
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.400]   people would come to Jerusalem to remember what God had done
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.760]   in delivering them from Egypt, to slavery to Egypt.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.400]   And so it's said at Passover that the city of Jerusalem would
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.840]   swell to about 250,000 people.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.400]   So I really want you to have a picture of what's going on here.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.120]   There are people coming from all over the place.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.600]   They are descending upon Jerusalem.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.800]   They are coming to the temple, the house of God,
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.600]   the place where the presence of God is said to reside.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.000]   The temple is to be a house of prayer.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.840]   And so what you should picture is this moment
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.880]   where there's this massive gathering.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.920]   It's like a conference.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   It's like going to Passion or coming to Awaken or Launch.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.600]   People are showing up, or they should be showing up,
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.400]   expecting, like, man, we're getting together.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.320]   The people of God are going to rally.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.600]   We're going to come together.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.680]   We're going to worship.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.960]   We're going to meet with God.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.440]   People are going to leave saying,
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.120]   I was so wrecked at Passover this year.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.320]   And people are going to be posting a bunch of fire emojis.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.520]   And it's just going to be--
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.200]   it's supposed to be one of those experiences where
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.560]   people come and meet with God.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.640]   And yet, look at what Jesus finds.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.320]   Verse 14, it says, "In the temple,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.400]   he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.680]   and the money changers sitting there."
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.080]   So I don't know what you expect when you show up
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.040]   to Awaken or a Passion conference.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.520]   I don't know if you expect to see farm animals there or not.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.760]   But Jesus shows up to the temple.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.920]   And inside the house of God, there is sheep and oxen.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.320]   There's pigeons flying around.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.800]   There's money changers.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   And you need to understand why these people are there.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.960]   The animals are there because people
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.800]   would be coming to make a sacrifice to God.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.160]   And so sheep or oxen or pigeons were
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.200]   animals that would be used in sacrifice to God, which
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.080]   was an act of worship.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.400]   People are coming from all over the Roman Empire.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.360]   So instead of people having to drag a sheep halfway
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.720]   across the Roman Empire, what you have
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.920]   is you have the leaders in the temple that are like,
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.400]   "No, let us make it a lot easier on you.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:46.360]   It's not B-Y-O-O. We've got you covered.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.880]   We'll have oxen here.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.760]   You can just show up.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.520]   You can pay for one.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.000]   And it will just make it a lot more convenient for you."
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.760]   And the deal with the money changers
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.840]   is that there was a temple tax that
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.600]   required a certain currency.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.320]   And so you've got people coming from all over the Roman Empire,
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.080]   which there's different currencies.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.880]   And so what the leaders of the temple are doing
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.840]   is they're just saying, "Look, we're
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.240]   putting money changers there because there's only
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.960]   one currency that's accepted.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.680]   And so we want to make it as convenient as possible for you
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:30.960]   to get the right currency in order to worship God."
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.480]   And yet, look at what happens in verses 15 and 16.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.200]   It says, "In making a whip of cords,
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.680]   he drove them all out of the temple."
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.240]   I love that phrase right there.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.320]   He made a whip, like on the spot.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.880]   Like, I don't know what he used.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.200]   I don't know if he was like, just sitting there like,
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.880]   just wait till I finish making this whip.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.320]   Like, I don't know where he got it from,
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.880]   like what he made it with.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.960]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.760]   It's kind of a baller move to just make a whip like that,
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.600]   and it works.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.080]   But he makes a whip, and he drove out
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.880]   of the temple the sheep and the oxen,
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.120]   and he poured out the coins of the money changers,
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.960]   and he overturned the tables, and he told them,
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.160]   who sold the pigeons, "Take these things away.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.080]   Do not make my father's house a house of trade."
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:27.280]   Jesus gets extremely angry, and he
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.720]   deals with everything going on in the temple.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.240]   Why?
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.840]   The issue isn't what they were doing.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   I want you to hear this.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.520]   The issue is not what they were doing.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.200]   The temple leaders were offering a nice service.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.000]   The fact that you don't have to drag your animal
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.320]   across the Roman Empire, that's helpful.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.640]   The fact that there's somebody that can exchange money
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.920]   to get the right currency, that's a helpful thing.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.960]   The issue isn't what they were doing.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.840]   The issue is where they were doing it.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.600]   It would be like me setting something up here on stage.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.680]   If you wanted to give money to the church,
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.440]   it's like, you know what, we'll just set up a credit card
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.040]   station right here on stage.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.280]   At any point in the service, you can just come up
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.320]   whenever you want.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.080]   It would just be weird.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   The issue is where they were doing it.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.600]   Let me ask you, anyone here, you ever
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.160]   choose to go and do your quiet time at Walmart
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.480]   on Black Friday?
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.240]   No?
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.720]   Anyone do your quiet times at petting zoos?
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.520]   Anyone taking your Bible to the state fair
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.400]   not to share the gospel with people
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.040]   but just to connect with Jesus?
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.960]   You're like, you know what, eating this fried Oreo,
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.000]   that's where I connect with Jesus.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.200]   No.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.560]   Why?
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.600]   It's not the right place.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.440]   Can you connect with God anywhere?
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.720]   Sure.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.400]   He's omnipresent.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.160]   He's everywhere.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.040]   And at the same time, there are other places,
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.120]   there are places that are more conducive to meeting with God
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:05.960]   than others.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.160]   The issue isn't what these people were doing.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.040]   The issue is where they were doing it.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.720]   The temple was the place where you
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.840]   were to come to meet with God.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.760]   That's why D.A. Carson, who wrote the leading commentary
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.160]   on the gospel of John, here's what he says.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.920]   He says, "Instead of solemn dignity
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.000]   and the murmur of prayer, there is
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.680]   the bellowing of cattle and the bleeding of sheep.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.480]   Instead of brokenness and contrition,
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.680]   holy adoration and prolonged petition,
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.200]   there is noisy commerce."
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.000]   What's the point?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.440]   This was a generation that placed no value
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.640]   on the presence of God.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.880]   You know what's interesting?
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.120]   And I hope you don't miss this.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.640]   At this particular time, the presence of God
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.680]   has departed from the temple
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.560]   and it is just business as usual for people.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.200]   The presence of God has departed
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.560]   and yet 250,000 people are coming to Jerusalem
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.400]   and leaving thinking that everything's good.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:17.000]   And I just wonder if that could ever be true of the porch,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.200]   that we could come in here
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.320]   and the band can sing some great songs
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.360]   and we've got a bunch of nice equipment
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.480]   that can make it sound really good
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.560]   and we can fill up this place
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.000]   and if 2,000 people show up
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.320]   and I can put together a message that is fairly coherent
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.680]   and it'll have some points
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.520]   and you might laugh at a moment or two along the way
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.680]   and you could leave
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.840]   and because a couple thousand people showed up,
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.440]   we could all be like, "Man, that was incredible.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.440]   Man, the porch, it was awesome.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.120]   Man, God showed up."
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.120]   And all along, God wasn't doing anything.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.920]   Like would we know it if God didn't show up?
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.800]   Would we know it?
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.160]   Like we wanna be a place
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.560]   that if the spirit of God didn't show up and move,
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.400]   that we would get on our faces
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.480]   and beg him to come in a new and fresh way,
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.000]   that we wouldn't be content to just show up,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.920]   sing songs, listen to a message and leave,
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.360]   having never met with God.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.920]   So the first point was Jesus cares deeply about the temple
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.520]   and so should we.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.840]   And if you're tracking with me,
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.960]   you might still be like,
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.160]   I think I'm tracking with you
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.680]   because the temple is about the presence of God
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.680]   but I'm still not completely following you
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.600]   on why you're using the language
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.440]   that we should care about the temple.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.480]   Why aren't you just saying
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.880]   we should care about the presence of God?
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.040]   No, we should care about the temple.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.320]   Why do I say that?
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.360]   Well, look at what Jesus goes on and says in verse 18.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.160]   "So the Jews said to him,
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.360]   'What sign do you show us for doing these things?'
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.680]   Jesus answered them, 'Destroy this temple
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.040]   and in three days I will raise it up.'
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:01.960]   The Jews then said,
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.760]   'It has taken 46 years to build this temple
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.200]   and will you raise it up in three days?'
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.040]   But he was speaking about," watch this,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.980]   "the temple of his body.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.960]   When therefore he was raised from the dead,
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.320]   his disciples remembered that he had said this
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.760]   and they believed the scripture
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.360]   in the word that Jesus had spoken."
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.240]   So don't miss this.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.480]   Again, I'm telling you,
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.360]   Jesus cared deeply about the temple, so should we.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.280]   Jesus now is saying the temple
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.200]   has moved from a building to a body.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.480]   And so when Jesus shows up,
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.960]   not only was God declaring in the garden temple in Genesis,
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.780]   I'm here,
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.180]   not only when he showed up in the tabernacle
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.160]   was God declaring, I'm here,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.740]   not only when Solomon built the temple,
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.660]   God was declaring, I'm here,
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.340]   but when Jesus Christ, Emmanuel,
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.680]   which means God with us, showed up,
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.080]   Jesus was declaring, I am here.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.040]   The God of the universe in the person of Jesus Christ
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.920]   is declaring, I am a God who is committed
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.360]   to being present with my people.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.000]   And what's interesting is in the building temple,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.340]   priests would do what?
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.600]   They would take an animal once a year
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.680]   and they would slaughter it and take the blood
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.100]   and sprinkle it on the altar
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.720]   as a way of making atonement
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.680]   for the sins of the nation of Israel.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.120]   They would do this once a year.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.840]   When Jesus declares that the temple
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.920]   has moved from a building to a body,
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.500]   it's as if he's saying, yeah,
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.080]   the sacrificial system doesn't exactly work like that
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.520]   anymore because instead of the blood of a lamb being shed,
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.080]   it's gonna be the lamb of God whose blood will be shed.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.440]   And so Jesus Christ's body was broken
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.880]   and his blood was shed.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:58.280]   And he has offered himself once and for all.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:04.120]   He has made payment for all of your sins
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.900]   and all of my sins.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:11.880]   And he is the temple that on the third day was resurrected
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.560]   as a demonstration that our sin could not keep him down
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.280]   and death could not win.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.480]   Jesus conquered the grave for you and for me.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.880]   Now watch this, okay?
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.320]   So if you're tracking with me, what's the point?
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.400]   Jesus cared deeply about the temple and so should we.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.240]   So hopefully you're getting a little bit more clarity, okay?
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.320]   The temple has moved from a building to a body.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.560]   So it makes sense.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.720]   We should care about the temple
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.280]   because Jesus just called himself the temple,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.740]   but Jesus, after he rose from the dead,
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.000]   he ascended into heaven.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.140]   Well, so what happens then?
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:56.020]   Like, why do we still care about the temple
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.560]   if Jesus's physical body is no longer present on the earth?
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.160]   Well, here it is.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.400]   I hope you don't miss this, okay?
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.680]   If you wanna know why you should care about the temple,
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.840]   it's because in 1 Corinthians chapter three,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.400]   listen to what Paul says to a group of people
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.880]   in a church in the city of Corinth.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.320]   He says this, "Do you not know
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.960]   that you are God's temple
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.840]   and that God's spirit dwells in you?"
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.640]   So let's put it all together.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.440]   Garden, temple, I'm here.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.140]   Tabernacle, I'm here.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.540]   Temple, I'm here.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.600]   Person of Jesus, Emmanuel, God with us, I'm here.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.320]   Jesus ascends into heaven,
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.160]   and what does he do?
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.240]   He sends the spirit of God,
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.280]   and the spirit of God does what?
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.840]   He fills the people of God collectively declaring,
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.800]   "I'm here.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.140]   I'm not just with you, I'm actually in you."
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:02.000]   And so in 1 Corinthians chapter three,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.880]   when he says, "Do you not know that you are God's temple,"
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.020]   that you there in the Greek, it's plural.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:12.920]   He's talking about the people of God collectively.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:18.940]   So we are the temple collectively.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.160]   We are the temple collectively.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.180]   I have mentioned it before.
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.980]   Some of y'all, it drives you crazy when I mention it.
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.460]   I went to Texas A&M University.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.700]   That's just the reality.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.220]   I know several of y'all did.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.960]   At Texas A&M, the fan base, the student body,
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.300]   is known as what?
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.180]   The 12th man, okay?
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.080]   And if you don't like A&M, look, it's okay.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.900]   We don't have to divide over it.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.040]   It's okay.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.660]   It's not my fault that you didn't go there.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.500]   That's on you.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.180]   But no, I'm just joking.
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.720]   I'm just joking.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.700]   I'm just making an illustration here.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.360]   Please come back.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.560]   The student body at Texas A&M University
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.520]   is known as the 12th man.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.240]   Do you wanna know why it's called the 12th man?
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.960]   It's because in A&M's history, there was one guy,
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.120]   his name was E. King Gill.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.660]   And one day in a game, he was called to go in
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.520]   from the stands.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.600]   And from that day on, the student body,
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.560]   the tradition is now that the student body all stands
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.040]   as the 12th man ready to go into the game.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.980]   And I hope that they would never put me in, honestly.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.380]   But the reason I tell you that is that the 12th man
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.380]   went from a person to a people.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.540]   And the same is true in such a more significant way,
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.880]   that the temple went from a person, Jesus Christ,
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   to a people, the body of Christ, the church.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.740]   That's a big deal.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.060]   Are y'all with me tonight?
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.140]   I just need to know if, okay, I just,
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.100]   I just wanna make sure because what I'm about
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.580]   to talk to y'all about is, here's what I want you to know.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.380]   I believe that God wants to do a significant work
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.220]   in your generation.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.500]   I really believe that.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.820]   I believe that God is pouring gasoline on a fire
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.740]   for your generation, and he wants to use you
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.140]   to take the gospel to different places.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.940]   And God is going to transform people's lives,
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.940]   and he's gonna give you the privilege
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.120]   of being a part of what he's doing.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.280]   But it requires us to have good theology
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.720]   when it comes to who we are as the people of God,
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.820]   as the temple.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:44.520]   The question that we should ask is,
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.880]   is if Jesus Christ were to walk into the porch tonight,
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.200]   is there anything that he would see
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.640]   that has made itself at home at the porch
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.360]   that just doesn't belong here?
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.960]   Like, is there anything that Jesus would see in this room?
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.360]   I'm not talking about a person.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.920]   I'm talking about activity
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.280]   that Jesus would see and drive it out.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.880]   So here's what we need to be careful of
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.320]   because in John chapter two,
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.920]   what did the temple leaders prioritize?
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   They prioritized convenience and attendance.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.100]   They prioritized convenience.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.280]   That's why they put the animals and the money changers
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.560]   in the place of worship.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.000]   And if we're not careful, we will prioritize convenience.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.840]   It's like, you know what?
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.980]   I'll go to church when I can go to church.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.520]   And so maybe we make it once a month
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.980]   or maybe twice a month, but we're busy,
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:45.820]   we're traveling a lot.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.240]   Sometimes it just feels better to wake up on Sundays
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.980]   and go to brunch.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.780]   Tuesday nights, it's just, we're busy people.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:58.120]   So if we're not careful, we'll prioritize convenience.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.440]   Or there's this belief now that, you know what?
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:04.200]   I don't need to go and gather with the people of God.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   You know what?
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.440]   I can stream anything I want from wherever I want.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.400]   Like I can podcast whoever I want.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.160]   I can curate my own little personal worship service
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.720]   with the people that I like best.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.960]   And I can just do that.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.920]   I can do it on the treadmill or when I'm driving in my car.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   I can meet with God.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.720]   I can just have my own little worship service
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.680]   wherever I want.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.240]   And that's true.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.120]   You can meet with God individually wherever you want.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.080]   But let's just be clear.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.080]   You sitting and listening to a podcast by yourself
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.480]   is a terrible replacement
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.120]   for gathering with the people of God.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.360]   Why?
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.120]   Because we collectively are the temple of God.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.000]   And so I tell you that just to say,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.260]   I was listening to a church consultant.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.640]   And what the church consultant said
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:06.480]   was we are headed toward on-demand
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.540]   surpassing live events.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.620]   So his point is we are moving toward a point
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.060]   where people attending church online
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.960]   is gonna surpass people attending in person.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.880]   And his point as a church consultant
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.800]   was if your church doesn't get on board, good luck.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.120]   And your church is on a slow decline.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.740]   And I just reject that.
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.940]   I reject that.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:39.240]   And I'm gonna ask you to reject it too.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.960]   You cannot replace gathering with the people of God.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.100]   Look around.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.840]   What a privilege that there are thousands of young adults
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.800]   we can gather together.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.360]   And we can meet with God together.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.000]   You know what stats say about your generation?
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.960]   Your generation, according to statistics,
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.600]   has the shortest attention spans of eight seconds.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.820]   And so you know what people are saying?
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:08.660]   You know what?
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.040]   We need to make sermons shorter and shorter.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:11.880]   Why?
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.760]   Because we need to make sermons more and more convenient
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.540]   for people with shorter attention spans.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.480]   And I just reject that as well.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.200]   It's not that I wanna talk for forever
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.520]   and I have a tendency to talk for a long time.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.600]   But my point is this.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.600]   I refuse to sit here and just feed you appetizers
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.880]   when we have a steak right here.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.040]   [audience applauding]
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.600]   And so I just tell you that to say
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.200]   I refuse to water things down for you.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.200]   I refuse to sit here and just give you small portions
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.720]   when I believe that your soul is hungry for a feast.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.460]   And so let me just encourage you.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:01.460]   Would you lean in and reject convenience?
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.720]   If we're not careful,
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.640]   our tendency will be to prioritize attendance.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.360]   Like it's just that we're here.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.120]   Like so we can show up and just go through the motions
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.640]   and sing songs without actually engaging
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.160]   or during the talk we're kind of half listening,
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.880]   half texting with our friends.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:22.080]   I would just say, man, if God wants to speak to you,
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.760]   position yourself in a place
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.520]   where you're ready to hear from him.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.280]   I don't care about you hearing from me.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.780]   I do want you to meet with God.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:36.600]   And then our tendency might be to prioritize our preferences.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.180]   Like we have the privilege of living in a city
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.660]   where there's a bunch of different churches.
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.920]   That is not the luxury that everyone in this world has.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.180]   There are people in countries
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:51.240]   where to gather together with others is illegal.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.940]   And so let's not take it for granted
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.540]   that we can gather together.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.900]   But let me just encourage you, pick a place and invest.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.440]   Don't jump from church to church to church.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.140]   And when there's one thing that bothers you,
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.780]   you bail and go somewhere else.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.100]   There is no perfect church
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.060]   because every church is full of imperfect people,
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:09.980]   including you.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.900]   And so I tell you that, not to slap you in the face,
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.740]   but to just say, I'm one of those imperfect people too.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:17.340]   The reason Watermark's imperfect is 'cause I'm here.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.740]   And that's okay.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.100]   That's the beauty of the body of Christ,
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.300]   that we can gather together as imperfect people
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.980]   and we can all enjoy the grace of God together.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:30.800]   But just pick a place and plant yourself there.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.180]   Just want you to imagine, imagine with me.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:39.020]   Imagine what Tuesday nights would be like.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.740]   Every Tuesday night, if every person,
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.860]   the minute you walked through those doors,
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.020]   you were positioning your heart,
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.940]   just saying God is here and I will meet with him.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.640]   I don't want this thing to distract me.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.100]   I don't want her to distract me.
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.000]   I don't want him, he's nice,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.100]   but I don't want him to distract me.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.420]   I'll talk to him afterward, but God is here
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.820]   and I want to meet with him.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.960]   Just imagine what would happen in this place.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.040]   Like if we all came in here and when we began to sing,
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.620]   we were singing with all of our hearts to God.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.700]   When we opened up this book, the word of God,
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.840]   we listened to it as if God was speaking to us.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.560]   Imagine how different we would be.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.500]   Tonight and tomorrow morning.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.500]   Imagine the healing that would take place
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.780]   in the hurting places of our hearts.
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.020]   We would be a different people.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.060]   This would be a different place.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.380]   Our apartment complexes would be different places
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:45.180]   because God is doing a work in us.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.540]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.060]   I'll just show you one more cool thing
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.300]   because I'm telling you,
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.060]   Jesus cared deeply about the temple and so should we.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.900]   Why?
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.700]   Because we are the temple collectively, but not just that.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.320]   Paul then says in 1 Corinthians 6, watch this, verse 19.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.740]   He says, "Or do you not know that your body
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.520]   "is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.760]   "whom you have from God?
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.520]   "You are not your own.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.600]   "You were bought with a price,
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.060]   "so glorify God in your body."
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.020]   Watch this.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:21.020]   The temple moved from building to a body, that's Jesus.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.140]   And then Jesus then descended into heaven
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.620]   and he sent his spirit.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.100]   Spirit of God has filled the people of God collectively,
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.300]   so we are the temple of God collectively.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.620]   But you know what Paul just told us?
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.440]   We are the temple of God individually.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.700]   So I don't know if you think about things like that,
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.260]   but I just want you to think when you wake up tomorrow,
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.860]   like if you know Jesus Christ,
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.380]   if you have put your trust in Jesus Christ,
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:50.380]   the spirit of God, your body is a house for the living God.
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:56.300]   He actually lives inside of you,
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.620]   which is just crazy to think about.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.900]   And so I've used this illustration before,
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.140]   but it just seems fitting
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.460]   because we're talking about our lives,
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:11.060]   our persons being houses for the spirit of God.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.380]   What you need to figure out is,
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.940]   are you expecting the spirit of God to rent or to own?
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.620]   Like we know what it's like,
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.460]   the teaks know what it's like to rent.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.420]   Okay, when you rent, and there's a lot of you,
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.180]   you are just renting right now.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.380]   When you rent, that place is not yours
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.340]   to do with it what you want.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.660]   Some of you act like it's yours to do what you want,
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.560]   and you're not gonna get your deposit back.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.560]   Good luck with that.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.840]   But like we've rented before,
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.000]   and when we've rented,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.440]   whatever the color of paint is on the wall,
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.280]   that's the color that we get.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.340]   Like in the last house that we rented,
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.640]   that the layout is not what we would have wanted.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.700]   Like if it was our house,
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.700]   we would have knocked out multiple walls,
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.400]   we would have shifted things around,
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.760]   we would have taken the ugly wood paneling,
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.360]   and we would have done away with it,
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.580]   and we would have made that house something really special,
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.980]   but it wasn't ours to do with it what we wanted.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.680]   But then we've owned different houses
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.560]   as a married couple along the way.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.760]   We owned a house in Austin, and then in Waco,
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.760]   and then in College Station,
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.800]   and now here in Dallas, we own a home.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.760]   And my wife loves to decorate, that's kind of her thing.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.160]   So she's constantly asking me,
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   "What do you think about this?"
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.680]   And that is not my thing at all.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.680]   So I'm like, "What do you think?
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.720]   "Do you like it?
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.000]   "Then I love it, that's great."
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.420]   But she has complete freedom
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:41.160]   to make the house what she wants it to be.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.700]   And so if the Spirit of God, if your life,
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:49.960]   if your person, if your body is a house for the living God,
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.420]   are you expecting the Spirit of God to rent or to own?
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.960]   Are you expecting Him to rent where it's like,
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.300]   "You know what, I'm glad you live in me,
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.000]   "and the reason you live in me
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.560]   "is because I've put my faith in Jesus Christ
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.360]   "who is going to get me into heaven one day,
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.560]   "so I'm so thankful that He saved me,
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.960]   "and I'm glad, I guess, that you live in me,
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.600]   "but just don't touch anything in my life."
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.400]   'Cause I kind of have things where I want it,
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.040]   and I kind of like the paint that's on the walls,
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.220]   and I like the layout of the house.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.080]   I like doing what I'm doing in my dating relationships.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.500]   I kind of like how I'm kind of quiet quitting at work.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:30.200]   I kind of like the way that I'm spending way more money
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.420]   than I actually make.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.800]   I like doing what I'm doing,
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.480]   and I don't want you jacking with any of it.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.920]   So you can rent.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.840]   Or are you in a place where you just say, "You can own.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.060]   "It's yours to do with what you want.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.180]   "You can reconfigure, you can remodel,
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.100]   "you can tear down, you can expand,
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.120]   "you can do whatever you want,
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.980]   "whenever you want to do it, because I exist for you.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.860]   "You don't exist for me."
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.380]   I just want to invite you to think
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.500]   of the godliest person that you know.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.400]   Who is it?
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.480]   Like who is the godliest person that you know?
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:15.460]   For me, I think about friends like Brian Fisher,
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.260]   or Greg Mott, or Ben Stewart,
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.920]   or Reese Gray is a guy who discipled me in college.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.940]   These are some of the godliest people that I know.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.320]   Do you know what makes them godly?
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.360]   It's not because they have these cute little sayings
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.660]   from time to time.
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:39.560]   It's because at some point in their lives,
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.760]   they all came to a place where they said,
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.480]   "You can own it.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.720]   "You can own the house of my life.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.900]   "If my life is a temple, it's yours."
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.860]   And then they've continued to do that every single day,
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.220]   and what's been the result
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.060]   is they have lived lives of worship to God.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:09.260]   And so, how do we respond to a message like this?
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.200]   Well, let me just encourage you, and then I'll wrap it up.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.580]   If we're the temple of God collectively,
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.500]   let's lean in together.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.340]   Let's meet with God together.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.300]   Let me just encourage you,
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.000]   when you come to church on Sunday morning,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.740]   or you come back to the porch next Tuesday night,
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.580]   the minute you walk through those doors, begin believing,
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.520]   "God is here, and I am going to meet with him.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.140]   "Let's meet with God together."
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:39.080]   And then if we are the temple of God individually,
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.300]   it's just a good question to ask yourself.
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.820]   Like, if Jesus, is there anything in your life
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.500]   that has made itself at home that just doesn't fit?
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.660]   Like, what's the pretzels from American Airlines
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.720]   in your life?
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.180]   That you're like, "What is that doing there?"
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.500]   As a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.660]   this makes no sense in my life.
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.420]   What is that?
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.300]   If something comes to mind,
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:11.300]   then just invite Jesus's ownership
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.860]   into that area of your life.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:19.900]   When I say that Jesus cared deeply about the temple,
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.940]   therefore, so should we, here's all I'm saying.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.540]   All I'm saying is this,
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:31.540]   may the presence of God be precious to his people.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.220]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.360]   May the presence of God be precious to his people.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.140]   And you know what the good news is?
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.720]   When Jesus drove out the animals
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.140]   and the money changers from the temple,
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.180]   it was an act of judgment,
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.580]   but it was also an act of mercy, why?
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.060]   Because he cleaned the house
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.740]   so that it could become a place of worship again.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.380]   And that's what Jesus has done for us.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.540]   When he went to the cross,
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.620]   do you know what he was doing?
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.500]   Is he was making a way.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:04.900]   He was dealing with all of the sin that prevented us
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.260]   from living true lives of worship to God.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.820]   And through his body being broken
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.860]   and his blood being shed,
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.900]   he has made a way for those who are sinful in God's sight
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.940]   to be made right with him.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.300]   So if you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.660]   my hope and prayer is that you would know him tonight.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.860]   May we be a people
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:26.140]   who find the presence of God to be precious.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.240]   Let's pray together.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:34.820]   Lord Jesus, would you
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.620]   just come and move in our lives right now?
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:42.300]   I thank you, God, that you are here
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.860]   and you wanna meet with us.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.820]   So friends, if you're listening to this
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.500]   and you've gone for all hour and 30 minutes of tonight
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.500]   and you have not connected with God yet, it's not too late.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.660]   Like you can still meet with God tonight.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:00.620]   As we sing a response song, you can meet with God tonight.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.380]   In this moment, you can meet with God tonight.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.620]   If you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.500]   you can begin a relationship with Jesus Christ right now.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.740]   Take a step.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.500]   Let's do business with the Lord.
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.100]   Let's respond to him.
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.660]   (gentle music)
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.500]   Thank you, God, that you are a God
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.540]   that's committed to being present with your people.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.940]   I thank you in the book of Revelation.
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.300]   When you make all things new, what is coming is a day
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.700]   when the dwelling place of God will be with man.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.340]   We will spend all of eternity in your presence
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:40.340]   because you are a God who is present with your people.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.300]   May your presence be precious to us.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.800]   We love you in Jesus' name.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:46.900]   Amen.
