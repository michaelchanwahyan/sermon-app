[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:32.040]   All right, let's do this.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920]   How we doing tonight, y'all?
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.520]   Woo!
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.360]   Hey, tonight-- thank you so much.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.280]   New shoes, thank you.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.440]   Hey, tonight we are wrapping up, like Carson said,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.320]   the Matchmaker series.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.200]   And we have talked about amazing things-- singleness, dating,
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.560]   marriage, all of those things.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.680]   And they brought me up tonight to finish
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.040]   strong talking about heartbreaking breakups.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.560]   Yeah!
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.040]   Something we all can resonate with in some way or the other,
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.080]   sadly, I bet.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.000]   And they were like, hey, going around the room,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.600]   who can communicate about heartbreak?
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.760]   And I was just like, I volunteer as tribute.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.720]   I'll do it.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.760]   So they got me up here.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.160]   And before I get to that, I want to bring you
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.960]   all into a moment in college where I was in my room alone.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.480]   And I want to go ahead and confess.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.360]   This was a sin.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.760]   And thank God for the Lord's redemption in my life.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.920]   But I was doing something I think we all have done,
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.280]   more than we like to admit.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.720]   I was downloading music illegally off of YouTube.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.240]   Yeah, LimeWire, or whatever it's called, that was me.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.040]   And I was that guy.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.800]   And iTunes was full of the sketchy, weird names
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.560]   of each of the songs, like the underscores and stuff.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.400]   And I was downloading music.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.640]   And as I'm copying the link, pacing it
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.320]   into this sketchy website, like interlink here,
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.160]   begin download, this notification popped up.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.800]   And it was like, warning, warning,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.240]   your Mac is under attack.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.280]   It is a virus.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.040]   You need to call Apple support immediately.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.080]   And they gave me a number.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.160]   I was like, seems legit.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.120]   So I called the number.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.400]   And I was like, I don't want a virus on this computer.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.160]   So I called them and I'm like, hey.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.520]   And they're like, hey, how's it going?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.440]   How can we help you today?
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.520]   And I'm like, my Mac has a virus.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.400]   I need you to get rid of it, whatever.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.880]   And they're like, yeah, we do this all the time.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.320]   What you need to do is click here, click there,
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.880]   bada bing, bada boom, type in your password.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.840]   We're gonna have access to your Mac.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.560]   We will start to take control.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.920]   And then we will, some of you already know where this is going.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.120]   We will start to take control.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.280]   And then before you know it, virus gone, no problem.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.120]   And so I'm like, sweet.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.760]   So I give them access to everything.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.600]   It's really cool.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.240]   I'm like, wow, you guys can really, where are you?
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.120]   Like, watching them, you know, click on things.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.400]   I hear like really fast typing.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.840]   And I'm like, man, you guys are like really fast typers.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.800]   And I'm like, hey, I'm gonna call my friend by the way
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   and just tell him what's going on
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.200]   in case I need to do anything else on my end.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.600]   He was like super smart IT tech guy.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.520]   I call him.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.880]   Oh, and by the way, before I left the phone call,
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.800]   the guy didn't say anything.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.640]   I'm like, are you good?
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.460]   You good?
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.300]   I just hear typing.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.840]   And so I call this guy and I'm like, hey,
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   here's the problem, don't worry.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.160]   My Mac has a virus and there's this guy, he's fixing it.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.680]   He was like, JD, bring me your computer right now.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.520]   And I was like, why?
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.120]   And he was like, Macs can't have viruses.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.440]   So you're being hacked.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.840]   You are literally being hacked right now.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.560]   Someone is trying to get everything on your Mac,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.080]   steal all your money, bring me your computer.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.160]   And I was like, what?
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.000]   And so I hang up with him.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.380]   Guy is still typing on the phone.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.520]   I'm like, you imposter, I'm gonna find you.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.320]   Wherever you are, I'm gonna find you.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.160]   I hang up, I take the Mac, I seatbelt it in.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'm driving to my friend's house.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.280]   And the Mac is, I'm just screaming.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.120]   I don't know if he can hear me.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.440]   I'm like, wherever you are, Italy, China,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.200]   FBI is coming, buddy.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.440]   And I'm just watching him go to work on my Mac.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.440]   And I bring it in, I'm like, fix it, fix it, fix it.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.920]   He takes the Mac, he just starts doing the same thing.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.740]   That kind of hacker.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.920]   I'm like, how do you know how to do this?
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.320]   Coding is coming up.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.300]   And he looks at me and he says, JD, we can fix this,
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.200]   but only under one condition, you might lose everything.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.680]   And I'm like, everything?
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.880]   I was a video editor.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.800]   I was, school, you know, college is on that Mac.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.880]   All these different things.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.720]   I'm like, everything?
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.600]   He's like, everything.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.680]   And I was like, send it.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.360]   And so he goes and he goes and he pushes a button
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.520]   and it's like wiping everything, resetting MacBook.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.360]   And I was just watching it, you know,
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.480]   it was like one of those, like in the arms of,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.520]   and it was like slow motion going away.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.040]   And it was so sad.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.120]   And I remember just being so mad at that person.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.920]   But the reality was is I thought that that relationship,
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.880]   hacker guy, was there to help me.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.000]   Reality was, is he was actually hurting me.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.760]   He was there to take from me.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.920]   And I start there because just like I needed to go
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.960]   to the professional of all things Mac,
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.920]   my friend that's all high tech,
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.720]   and he had to tell me, hey, that relationship is harming you.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.920]   You need to get out immediately.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.480]   I think some of us need to go to the expert
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.740]   on all things love, all things dating, all things marriage,
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.320]   and go, hey, you're in a relationship
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.920]   that you think is helping you and it is harming you.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.140]   It is taking from you.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.320]   And tonight, as we wrap up the dating series,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.840]   I hope that every person here flourishes in love.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.160]   Like I truly hope you all find love.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.240]   It would be amazing.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.200]   But the reality is, is sometimes and most times,
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   a lot of us don't get to love without experiencing hurt
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.080]   and experiencing heartbreak.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.160]   And so I think it's important that we talk about it
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.200]   from a biblical perspective.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.600]   And so I wanna go to God, the person who knows all,
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.760]   knows the condition of the heart because he created it,
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.480]   and see what he has to say about love
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.860]   and make sure that we are all aware,
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.080]   hey, you might have to get out of this relationship.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.920]   You might need to break up because a breakup now,
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.880]   heartbreak now in the temporary
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.880]   is better than a broken marriage in the future.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.280]   And so if you don't deal with this now,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.200]   you could end up not just breaking yourself,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.560]   but breaking a lot of people in the days to come.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   And so I wanna go into heartbreak and breaking up tonight
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.280]   by talking about two things, really simple,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.340]   when to break up and how to heal from your heartbreak,
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.500]   when to break up and how to heal from your heartbreak.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.420]   Because it's better that we go ahead.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.100]   And like I said, put in the work now to go,
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.940]   do I need to get out?
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.140]   Like, do I need to flee?
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.100]   And here's the reality.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.780]   When I had to delete everything off my Mac,
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.540]   when I lost all the things that I had worked for
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.520]   and all the time I put into all the things on that Mac,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.220]   it was better for me to lose things willingly,
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.980]   to make the choice to lose it all
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.080]   than to unknowingly have it taken off from me
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.920]   and have everything taken from me
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.280]   like that guy was planning on doing.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.100]   And so tonight, let's see if we didn't make that choice
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.320]   to experience what might be heartbreak now
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   to experiencing something more whole in the future.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.080]   So when to break up?
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.380]   Now that I've got this super heavy
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.100]   and we're all like, yay, breakups.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.400]   When to break up?
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.980]   I wanna talk about just four easy reasons
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.240]   to identify when to break up.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.080]   The first one, when you are dating their potential.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.620]   Reason number one, when you are dating their potential.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.940]   Here's what that looks like.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.640]   When it comes to like, if you're dating someone
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.900]   and trying to figure out if they're legit or not spiritually,
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.020]   like if they're truly a man or a woman of God,
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.760]   you start to do this thing where you compromise
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.400]   because maybe they're like a 10 on hotness,
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.100]   but like a four on spiritualness.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.620]   And you're like, it seems legit.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.460]   And like, we go to church every now and then.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.900]   He loves the Christmas service.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.740]   I mean, he just loves it.
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.380]   He loves Christmas carols.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.260]   Maybe guys, you're like, yeah,
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.220]   like we totally like hooked up three times this week.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.340]   But like on Sunday, she texted me a verse
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.140]   and was like, thankful God gave me you.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.140]   And it's like, there is like a hint of God
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.060]   in this relationship.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.460]   So like, it's legit.
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.420]   We are spiritual, we're good.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.220]   And you start to go, even though I know deep down
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.380]   this isn't good, I have hopes.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.620]   I see glimpses of hope that this person will one day be good
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.020]   and you start to date their potential.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.380]   But I want to make you aware
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.980]   that if you are dating someone's potential
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.000]   over their present reality,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.460]   you are going to end up hurting yourself.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:02.340]   You want their present reality to be all about the Lord.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.580]   You want someone who's not hopefully one day
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.340]   going to stop verbally abusing you.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.180]   Hopefully one day, potentially out there,
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.860]   they'll start wanting to go to church
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.660]   and not just wanting to watch football all day.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.020]   You'll hope that one day they're not just like,
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.140]   they're wanting to read the Bible
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.700]   and like go through Bible studies together
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.100]   and serve the church together.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.260]   You're not just going one day, one day,
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.420]   you know, when we get kids,
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.900]   I'm sure when he's a father,
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.980]   he'll take this stuff more seriously.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.540]   Or man, when she starts, when we get a house,
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.200]   when I buy a house and put a ring on it,
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.380]   that's when we'll start going to church
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.620]   and doing the God thing.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.740]   But for now, like, let's have fun.
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.040]   And there's this idea of like a potential future
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.820]   that like is laced with spiritual things.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.180]   And you have to ask yourself and be honest with yourself.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:52.100]   Hey, if this person isn't pursuing God now,
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.900]   if this person doesn't want as an individual
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.300]   to lead me now towards Christ,
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.380]   what do I think is gonna change?
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.660]   Like, what's it gonna take for this person to change?
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.460]   And if they didn't get it right as a single person
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.420]   before they met me,
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.880]   if they'd never had a desire for God without me,
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.060]   apart from me, what do I think is gonna happen?
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.180]   And you're living in this fantasy potential world
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.340]   and not realizing the present reality that you're in.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.740]   Second Corinthians 6.14 puts it like this.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.580]   Don't team up or date or be in a relationship
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.540]   with those who are unbelievers.
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.480]   How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness?
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.300]   How can light live with darkness?
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.060]   What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil?
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.980]   How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever?
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.400]   And what union can there be between God's temple and idols?
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.580]   For we are the temple of the living God.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.460]   I think a lot of times we don't see ourselves
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.220]   as the temple of the living God.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.420]   We don't understand what it means
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.800]   to be God's son or daughter.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.600]   So we're okay with dating trash.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.180]   And I think a lot of times who you date
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.180]   says a lot about who you think you are.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.000]   Because if you saw yourself as the temple of the living God,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.480]   meaning that if I am walking in relationship with God,
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.960]   that literally the Holy Spirit, the Bible says,
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.580]   comes inside of me and I am like the host.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.000]   I am the house that God dwells in.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.660]   I'm not dating trash.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.640]   I'm not taking a spray paint and spray painting myself.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.000]   No, I am representing Christ.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.080]   And I'm wanting someone who's going to also next to me,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.240]   beside me, represent Christ.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.640]   You can't say, "Hey, I'm light and be around darkness."
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.560]   It doesn't work.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.640]   And so the first thing you have to ask yourself is,
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.200]   am I dating their potential?
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.840]   Because if you are, you're gonna end up making excuses.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.020]   You're gonna end up lowering your standards.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.580]   And before you know it, you're gonna be pulled further
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.520]   and further away from being about God yourself.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.640]   It's like the idea of missionary dating.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.420]   You're supposed to be on mission together,
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.700]   not on mission for them.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.560]   Okay?
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.840]   And we've used this illustration a lot.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.680]   Emma, where are you at?
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.640]   Can you come up here?
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.720]   Or down here, I guess.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.540]   You've probably seen this,
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.480]   but a lot of times what this looks like is like,
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.040]   let's say I'm someone who's really trying to follow God.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.680]   Like I've been going through my devotional.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.840]   I've been reading my Bible.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.240]   I've been coming to church every Sunday.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.640]   I'm even going through membership class.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.320]   I never thought I'd be going through membership class.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.640]   And then I meet this person at the bar
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.120]   and I'm kind of in this in-between world.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.320]   And they're like, "Yeah."
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.160]   You're like, "Hey, are you spiritual?
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.040]   Are you religious?"
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.120]   He's like, "Yeah, I've gone to church.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.940]   I was raised Catholic.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.240]   I was this, I was that."
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.760]   And he starts sending you like, "Okay, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.520]   God box, check."
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.840]   And you start to date and you start to notice patterns
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.680]   and you start to realize, okay,
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.200]   this person doesn't really read their Bible.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.680]   This person doesn't really like to go to church.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.040]   I feel like I'm kind of like pulling them to church.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.840]   And you start to say, "Hey, come up here.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.640]   Come on, come on.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.460]   Hey, what are you doing?
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.600]   Come with me to church.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.520]   Emma, come on.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.880]   Don't you want to go to church?"
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.360]   And you're sitting here
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.640]   and you're trying to pull this person
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.920]   up to where you are spiritually.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.480]   Like, "Hey, it's amazing up here.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.360]   You should come try it.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.520]   Come on, come on."
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.400]   And the reality is, is it's actually easier.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.600]   The law of gravity would say that it's easier
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   for Emma to pull me down here
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.800]   than for me to pull her up there.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.640]   Thank you, Emma.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.720]   Let's give it up for Emma really quick.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.000]   (congregation applauding)
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.480]   And I think so many of us,
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.040]   that's our reality is we're sitting here mentally,
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.560]   spiritually in this struggle of going,
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.280]   "I just, I'm seeing their potential.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.240]   I know they can do it.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.360]   If you would just come on, buddy,
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.100]   get there so I can stop feeling so guilty about dating you."
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.120]   And they're pulling you down
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.000]   and they're pulling you lower
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.440]   because they're asking something of you.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.680]   And you're operating as something
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.960]   that you were never supposed to be.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.520]   Your dating life, your love life
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.120]   was never supposed to look like you pulling someone.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.820]   It's supposed to look like you two pushing each other.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.300]   Not pulling, not forcing, pushing, respecting, honoring,
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.620]   and growing together towards Christ.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.240]   So quit dating potential.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.440]   If they don't want Christ now, break up with them.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.320]   It's that simple.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.600]   Second reason to break up.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.580]   When you're dating is only physical.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.340]   When you're dating is all about the physical.
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.500]   This is what this looks like.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.540]   When you're dating,
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.320]   like let's say you, you know, just to say it plainly,
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.680]   people call it makeup sex.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.320]   You're in conflict, you're yelling at each other,
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.700]   you're going through all these problems,
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.920]   and then somehow you always end up having sex.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.180]   It's just mind blowing.
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.000]   Like you end up doing the most intimate thing
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.980]   after all of the hurting.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.780]   And you think, okay, well, the sex is good.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.020]   Okay, the physical is good.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.420]   Or, hey, we're making out all the time.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.260]   Every time we're hanging out,
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.580]   we like kind of get to the kissing.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.160]   I'm kind of like not acknowledging,
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.300]   just like you weren't acknowledging
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.440]   like the spiritual component,
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.860]   you're kind of not acknowledging that,
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.620]   hey, we don't really seem to talk about real things,
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.180]   deep things, we don't really seem to like go there.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.600]   I can't have like a deep conversation with this person,
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.100]   but man, we can get physical.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.780]   Man, he seems to really change
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.720]   when I talk about having sex.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.020]   Or, hey, when I'm kind of showing a little bit of freaky,
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.820]   that's when he kind of gets into me.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:14.020]   And girls, I want to first say to you, get out.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.020]   Like if he doesn't respect you enough
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.120]   to not just see you as a physical being
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.460]   that just brings him pleasure,
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.740]   get out.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.220]   And guys, if you are just seeing a woman
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.040]   or if she honestly in 2020,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.020]   if she's just seeing you as some physical object
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.380]   to make her feel more affirmed
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.620]   and fill a void in her life, get out, bro.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.460]   Because relationships, God never designed for such intimacy.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.500]   Sex is a gift from God.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.300]   And if you are using that gift and distorting it
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.020]   and breaking it and bringing it into the dating world,
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.580]   you are fogging up all of your perception.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.280]   You're fogging up all of the reality,
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.340]   and sex is like this thing that like,
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.820]   it like puts drunk goggles on you
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.060]   and you can't see clearly.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.540]   And all of a sudden your relationship
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.180]   becomes all about the what, rather than the who.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.980]   And you start to not be able to see clearly
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.680]   that the who I'm dating is not a good person.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.900]   But hey, the what, the physical is pretty good.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.840]   So I'll stick around.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.420]   It kind of like, it's like a bandaid.
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.540]   It fixes the problem.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.460]   We're good, I'm good.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.300]   It's just fun, noncommittal.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.100]   And that's just not God's design for dating.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.880]   If your dating revolves all around physical, breakup.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:30.660]   If you think that, hey, if we just live together,
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.760]   play house, shack up, hey, we can have sex,
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.260]   we're never gonna get married.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.620]   Like we're gonna get married, okay?
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.760]   So it's like, why wait?
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   You know, it's okay, sex isn't that bad.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.900]   And you're doing all the things
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.260]   that God intended for marriage.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.940]   Here's what that communicates about your reality.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.700]   You want all the benefits of marriage,
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.460]   but you're not willing to put in the commitment.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.360]   You're not willing to put in the work.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.680]   And so if everything always seems to go back
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.900]   to the physical, or when the physical is the only time
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.280]   that you feel alive and something going on
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.180]   between you and your significant other, get out, breakup.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.900]   The next reason to break up,
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.000]   when you're dating pushes you away from people.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.140]   Proverbs 18, one says,
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.980]   "Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.340]   "He breaks out against all sound judgment."
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.400]   Guys, your relationship is meant to happen
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.380]   within the context of other relationships.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.780]   You should allow people to constantly be speaking
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.640]   into your relationship, knowing what's going on.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.340]   If you are dating in private,
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.260]   if your person is asking you to isolate yourself,
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.740]   if people are coming around you saying,
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.480]   "Hey, it seems like ever since you started dating so-and-so,
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.940]   "we don't see you very much."
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.780]   You need to see that as a red flag.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.140]   If you're someone that maybe your best friends
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.100]   are coming up to you and they're saying,
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.420]   "Hey bro, she seems kind of like crazy.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.860]   "You might wanna like get out of that."
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.360]   You're like, "No man, like trust me,
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.540]   "it's just like this thing we got, it's like special bro."
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:05.740]   Or girls, if your sisters or girls or whatever
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.420]   are coming over to you,
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.820]   I don't know if they should call each other.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.520]   If they're coming over to you and they're like,
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.320]   "Hey, he seems like not good for you.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.580]   "Like, hey, I'm actually being serious, I'm begging you.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.400]   "You might wanna get out of that.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.340]   "Something seems off.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.000]   "Why doesn't he wanna be around?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.420]   "Or why do you always seem more sad?
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.820]   "Why are you always crying?
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:27.780]   "Why have you changed?
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.260]   "Why are you getting more gloomy?"
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.240]   If they're saying that to you,
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.080]   you need to wake up and listen.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.020]   I think so many people like all before a significant other,
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.860]   we were so down to listen to everyone's advice.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.740]   "Tell me what I should do, tell me what I should do."
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.180]   But how come sometimes when we're in a relationship
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.900]   with a bad person, a jerk,
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.860]   any kind of person that's not good for us,
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.460]   we suddenly think we're experts?
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.460]   Like, what is that?
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.340]   And so if you're dating in private,
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.660]   if you're dating and it's pushed you away from your people
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.340]   and you're not dating in community,
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.840]   I would encourage you to either fix it or break up.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.020]   And the last reason you should break up
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.180]   is when you're dating has no purpose.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.940]   We say this a lot here,
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.100]   you're dating should have a destination.
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.260]   It should have an end goal and that end goal
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.180]   by God's design biblically is marriage.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.940]   And if you are dating someone
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.740]   who is making you constantly wonder, question,
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:26.740]   insecure, uneasy of where you're at, like, what is this?
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.380]   Where is this heading?
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.500]   Does he actually like me?
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.340]   Am I actually the only one?
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.200]   How many girls does he Snapchatting?
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.500]   How many guys, how many ex-boyfriends
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.860]   is she reaching out to when she gets a little too drunk?
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.380]   Like, where are we at?
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.620]   Where is this?
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.440]   And if you are with someone
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.520]   that you can't even talk about the future,
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.880]   get out because you're not ready.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.420]   And if you aren't ready for commitment
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.740]   or if they aren't ready for commitment, you need to get out.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.940]   You need to break up
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.380]   because dating needs to have a destination.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.580]   Dating is a exploration that leads to a confirmation.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.820]   That confirmation could be yes or no.
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.460]   This is good, this is bad.
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.500]   We're gonna get married, we're not gonna get married.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.540]   It can be a confirmation, but even if it's yes or bad,
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.460]   it was dating, it was right.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.380]   But if it's just dating with a question mark,
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.480]   that's not right.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.040]   Your dating needs purpose.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.220]   Men, be clear with your women.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.100]   Say, girl, it is you and only you.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.380]   Let them know, hey, I'm just about you.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.580]   I'll delete Snapchat, I'll get off Instagram.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.440]   Dating apps, obviously, I hope they're gone.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.940]   Girls, if he still has dating apps on his phone
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.820]   and he's dating you, break up, okay?
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.260]   Let me just say that.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.760]   Hey, you can take my text messages.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.820]   You have an open invitation into my life
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.220]   because I have nothing to hide.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.300]   I am about you.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.540]   I am pursuing the Lord.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.740]   I'm committed to the Lord.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.660]   I'm about you.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.660]   Women, the same for you.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.900]   Hey, I am so in love with Jesus.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.820]   I'm so about you.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.780]   Therefore, I'm willing to lay down my passions.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.740]   I'm willing to set physical boundaries.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.060]   I'm willing to do whatever it takes
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.920]   to make sure that we are walking in God's design
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.860]   and what's best for us because I am so about you
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.420]   and I'm so about what God wants for us.
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.180]   That is love.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.340]   That is how you feel alive with someone.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.460]   When you choose to be on mission together
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.300]   towards the destination that God designed.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.620]   And if you're not with someone who wants to do that,
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.380]   bounce, okay?
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.220]   Okay.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:37.660]   Okay.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.620]   A scripture for that.
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:44.020]   Ephesians 5 31, I don't want my tangent.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.180]   Says, "As the scriptures say,
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.980]   a man leaves his father and mother
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.820]   and is joined to his wife
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.380]   and the two are united into one."
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.540]   That's just God's design.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.660]   Like leave mom and dad, leave the old life,
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.620]   leave the talking to other women and other men
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.300]   and all the flakiness and all the uneasiness
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.260]   and all the lack of clarity and pursue her,
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.340]   commit to her, commit to him,
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.660]   sacrifice and pursue God's design, which is marriage.
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.380]   And fellas, as I close the section of when to break up,
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.460]   you might be some of the reasons
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.260]   that she needs to break up with you
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.120]   and don't make her do it.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.220]   If right now you are listening to what I'm saying
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.700]   and you're going, I'm that,
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.820]   I'm the toxic person for her,
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.380]   I'm the bad influence for her,
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.340]   I am not the spiritual leader for her,
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.480]   I am not being a man of God,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.540]   you need to go end it with her.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.740]   And yeah, it might hurt her for now,
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.780]   but it will help her later.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.560]   And you need to go get it right
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.260]   because your most important relationship
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.380]   is your relationship with God.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.880]   And if you are not God's man,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.620]   then you don't need to be her man.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.740]   Okay.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.580]   No, no, no.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.620]   Keep going.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.620]   Ladies,
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.060]   men, it's coming.
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:12.660]   If you are pointing fingers right now and going,
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.500]   you know what?
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.340]   He's not that, he's not that, he's not that, he's not that.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.620]   Why are you with him?
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.180]   And if I had to look at your track record,
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.220]   I bet you've been with more guys like him before.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.020]   And so you need to ask yourself,
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.820]   guys, I know we're kidding, having fun,
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.620]   but this is serious.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.200]   You need to ask yourself why?
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.340]   I talked about this like with the last talk,
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.300]   wasting my time right now,
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.300]   but I'm saying you need to make the move of I'm done.
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.880]   I'm pursuing the right relationship first and foremost,
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.860]   and then that will impact the future relationships I'm in.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.100]   And so if you keep going back
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.880]   to hurtful, harmful relationships,
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.580]   break up and get the right relationship right.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.080]   I'm begging you.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.260]   And if you do, you'll be okay.
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.720]   It might hurt for a season, both of you, it'll be okay.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.840]   You're gonna get through it.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.420]   And I'm gonna tell you how in the next section.
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.500]   After you identified when you break up,
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.280]   let's say, hey, JD, okay, I'll break up, I'll end this,
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.460]   but I know this is gonna result in loneliness
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.420]   and hurts and heartache.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.980]   What do I do with that?
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.080]   Which I'm glad you asked.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.220]   The next section is how to heal from heartbreak
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.060]   or how to heal from your breakup.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.940]   I'm gonna give it to you in two steps.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.300]   It's so amazing.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.380]   The Lord, I think He intentionally gave us the answer
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.060]   to how we help heal our heart
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.000]   is the same way that we heal anything
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.860]   on our body that's broken.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.060]   One time I, in college, made a stupid mistake
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:47.460]   the first day of summer to go off a zip line unattached,
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.260]   like not attached to it, just like my body.
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.300]   And I like held onto the things.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.760]   I was like, Geronimo, I went off the zip line,
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.440]   fell 22 feet, broke my ankle.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.160]   Yeah, it's a long story, I'll tell you another time.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.620]   So my ankle, like my foot is literally,
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.520]   my toes are supposed to be going up like this.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.740]   They were going like this, okay?
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.060]   They were like over here.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:08.980]   And I was like, oh, okay.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.660]   So the first thing I did was pass out.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.320]   And then once I came back,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.100]   I wasn't like, take me to Burger King.
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.180]   I don't know why I said Burger King,
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.180]   but take me to Burger King.
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.820]   No, I was like, take me to the hospital.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.260]   Take me to the doctor.
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.620]   Take me to someone who knows what to do with this.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:33.620]   And they take me to the doctor because why?
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.740]   The doctor knows how to fix my broken leg.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:42.520]   In the same way, you need to go to the expertise,
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.300]   the expert, the creator of your heart
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.660]   when your heart is broken.
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.520]   You need to stop going to everything else.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.960]   You need to stop going to alcohol, addiction, pornography,
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.880]   Netflix, ice cream, bickering about your ex.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.360]   You need to stop going to all these different things
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.880]   to look for healing when there's only one person
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.800]   who knows how to actually bring healing to your heart.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.900]   It's the great physician.
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.280]   His name is God.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.720]   And you need to stop going to all these different places
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.200]   thinking, okay, this is the doctor of my life.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.040]   This will heal me.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.820]   No, they'll just put Band-Aids on it.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.880]   They won't heal you.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.920]   And you need to go to church.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.360]   You need to get into community.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.920]   You need to start opening up your Bible and reading it.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.600]   And you need to start developing a relationship
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.600]   with the only person who truly knows how to heal your heart.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.880]   And then after you go to him,
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.080]   after you go to the great physician, to God,
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.480]   and you bring him your broken heart,
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.960]   just like I brought to the doctor my broken leg,
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.480]   that doctor healed it to me and said, what happened?
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.320]   Tell me everything.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.140]   Where is it hurting?
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:41.980]   What are you feeling?
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.480]   He started touching my leg and my foot and going,
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.300]   what's going on?
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.140]   He's analyzing.
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.240]   He's wanting all the details
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.560]   because the more I can give him,
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.320]   the more he better knows how to help me.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.920]   In the same way, God,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.600]   he doesn't want you just to come and be like,
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.440]   hey, are you good?
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.800]   And you're like, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.640]   Like, it's good.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.700]   Like, no worries here.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.540]   That's what we do.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.680]   Why does our first instinct,
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.960]   we're sitting there crying, hurting.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.760]   Our friends are walking up, they're like, hey, are you good?
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.080]   Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.520]   I'm fine, I'm really fine.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.880]   Yeah, are you sure?
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.400]   Yeah, I'm good.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.880]   Or you become just the worst person to work with at work.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.560]   You're invalidating, you're quick-tempered,
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.320]   you're rude, you shut off your friends
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.780]   because you're not fine.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.680]   And people are checking in on you
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.920]   and they're saying, hey, you good?
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.040]   I know that breakup was hard.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.000]   Are you good?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.440]   And you're like, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.200]   Look at me, back to me, back to my self-care,
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.400]   back to my self-help.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.520]   I don't need to go to the helper.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.640]   I don't need to go to the word.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.600]   I can go to the world.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.000]   I can do all these different things and I can fix myself.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.840]   I'm fine and you're not fine.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.480]   And you know it and I know it.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.740]   You are not fine.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.040]   If the best thing you can do tonight
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.440]   is look at yourself in the mirror and say out loud,
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.280]   I'm not okay.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.840]   Some of you haven't done that.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.400]   You've suppressed and you've suppressed and you've suppressed
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.280]   and you have not dealt with your pain.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.880]   You have not dealt with your heartbreak.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.480]   And just like if I chose to not go to the doctor that day
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.880]   and tell him how I'm broken,
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.400]   if you don't choose to go to God
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.680]   and tell him the broken pieces of your heart,
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.440]   you're gonna walk around with a limp and hurting
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.920]   and making everyone around you concerned, awkward,
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.680]   all these different things for the rest of your life.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.540]   And you're gonna end up hurting yourself even more.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:20.220]   And so it is time to go to the doctor
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.380]   with your broken heart.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.160]   Go to the Lord and tell him how you're feeling.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.360]   It hurts here.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.660]   When he did this, it hurts.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.440]   When she cheated, it hurts.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.980]   I wanna address something really quick.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.620]   I have talked to more guys this year
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.340]   who have been cheated on by women than I can count.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.780]   And I started thinking about it.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.700]   I'm like, you know, one of the things I hear a lot for women
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.820]   is all guys are jerks.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.720]   And then I was thinking about it more and I was like,
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.560]   you know what?
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.920]   I don't actually think all guys are jerks.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.960]   I think they're hurt.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:01.860]   I think at some point in that guy's life, he was broken.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.460]   Guys hate rejection.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.980]   That's why they're afraid to ask a lot of girls out.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.900]   And he was broken and he was hurt.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.660]   And instead of going to the Lord
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.420]   and going to God's people and talking about it,
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.800]   he choose to just, I'm fine.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.700]   And now he hurts a lot of women.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.100]   Now he's scared to commit and you call him a jerk.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.300]   I just go to him and say, bro, you're just hurt.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.240]   Who hurts you?
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.460]   Was it your dad?
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.620]   Your mom?
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.720]   Who cheated on you?
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.860]   Who broke up with you?
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.020]   Let's go to God.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.020]   Let's deal with it.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.880]   And ladies, I know that you also too, like,
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.300]   well, hey, me too, I've been cheated on.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.500]   I've been hurt.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.580]   Same to you.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:53.180]   Quit going to Tinder, dating apps, Instagram,
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.600]   self-help books.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.180]   Go to God.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.140]   Go to his word.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.700]   Go to fellow Christ followers and say,
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.080]   I am broken and here's where it hurts.
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.220]   If you wanna give God the broken pieces of your heart,
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.380]   you just can't give him some.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.120]   You can't just go to church and call it fixed.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.660]   You have to give him all of your heart.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.400]   It's the idea of surrender.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.180]   God, I give you all my heart,
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.860]   the good, the bad, the ugly, the brokenness.
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:28.460]   And once you do that, step two will begin to take place.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.620]   He'll begin to tell you the process towards healing.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.420]   And your call is to trust the process.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.580]   Matthew 11, 28 through 30 says,
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.860]   then Jesus said, come to me,
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.540]   all of you who are weary and carrying heavy burdens,
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.620]   and I will give you rest.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.740]   Take my yoke upon you.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.580]   Let me teach you because I am humble and gentle at heart
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.220]   and you will find rest for your souls
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.660]   for my yoke is easy to bear
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.560]   and the burden I give you is light.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.980]   Another verse that comforts me in hard times
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:00.900]   when I feel broken.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.060]   Psalm 34, 18, the Lord is close to the brokenhearted.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.780]   He rescues those whose spirits are crushed.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.740]   Psalm 55, 22 says, give your burdens to the Lord
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.980]   and he will take care of you.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.180]   He will not permit the godly to slip and fall.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:21.300]   Guys, God is near to the brokenhearted.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.380]   He's not afraid of your feelings.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.060]   He's not afraid of your hurt.
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.700]   He's not afraid of your past sex life or your addiction.
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:33.620]   He wants it all because doctors love to see patients healed.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:39.220]   When you bring your troubles and your sickness
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.020]   and your brokenness to God, he is like, yes,
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.420]   you are using me for my design.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.540]   And now I am giving to you
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.420]   what I was designed to give to you.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:56.020]   And there's no better way to deal with heartbreak
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.580]   than to come to the creator of your heart.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.300]   Psalm 147, three says, he, being God,
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.020]   heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.780]   I think for me, when I hear that word bind,
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.260]   I think of something that's withholding, restricting,
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.180]   holding me back.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.100]   And right now you could think,
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.220]   God wants me to break up with her
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.660]   because he wants me to be lonely.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.680]   Or he doesn't have, well, you know,
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.900]   what's gonna happen after that?
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.620]   And you can think that God is out to get you
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.780]   and bring harm to you and hurt your life.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.380]   And that word binding actually
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.440]   is like the illustration of a cast
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.020]   because that's what the doctor did to me.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.540]   After he reset my bone in surgery,
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.440]   he then wrapped it in a cast.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.900]   And the purpose of a cast to heal the bone that is broken
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.900]   is to do two things, reset and restore.
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:46.940]   In the same way, God's purpose in your breakup,
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.820]   his healing to your breakup is to reset you
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:50.960]   and to restore you.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.600]   The problem is, is you would rather rebound than reset.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.780]   You would rather go and chase after anything
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.940]   that will give you attention.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.700]   You'd rather go hook up with any guy or any girl
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.740]   that will hook up with you.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.920]   You'd rather run to the bars.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.160]   You'd rather run to every other scene
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.460]   than actually coming to God.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.520]   You would rather rebound than reset.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.420]   That thing that makes me actually have to address this hurt.
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.780]   And I don't wanna start over, frankly.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.220]   I had something good there.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.380]   I don't wanna end this.
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.180]   But I'm telling you, if it is time to break up,
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.020]   your breakup, just like that cast,
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.020]   its purpose is to stabilize and make me,
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.520]   force me to rest the use of my leg.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:35.420]   So breakups are meant to put you on a break
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.700]   and to put your heart on a break.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.440]   Your heart was not designed to fall in love,
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.260]   to date and then break up and then date and then break up,
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.620]   then date and break up.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.700]   No, God is using that breakup
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.260]   and he brings healing to that breakup
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.860]   when you let your heart have a break.
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.580]   And when you let your heart have a break,
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.020]   he is gonna do those two things.
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.500]   He's gonna reset you, reset your focus,
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.700]   reset your attention, reset your heart,
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.220]   reset your ability to love, reset your trust,
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.300]   reset your peace.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.540]   He's gonna reset all of these things
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.860]   and then he's gonna restore the broken pieces.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.940]   As he is resetting you, he will be restoring you.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:18.420]   And so you need to stop turning to all of these things
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.740]   to experience healing and running to all these things.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.740]   You need to go and let God put a cast around your heart
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.340]   that is his love, his word, his people, his truth,
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.940]   and you need to be still and let restoration happen.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:39.920]   Learn how to love again, how to trust again,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.880]   how to hope again.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.740]   There is hope on the other end of surrender.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.780]   When you surrender the good and the bad,
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:52.740]   the broken pieces of your heart and your love to God,
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:57.740]   there is hope and that hope all lies within Jesus.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:03.100]   And guys, I want y'all to know,
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:07.800]   like as I close up here, like firsthand, I have been there.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.860]   Heck, I was there last year.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:15.120]   Two-year relationship,
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.940]   thought it was going like towards the destination of marriage
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.000]   and God said, nope.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.620]   And I moved to Dallas all alone,
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.740]   didn't know anyone, starting a new life.
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:28.260]   And last summer I sat in heartbreak,
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.940]   just like, God, what are you doing?
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.040]   Like, where are you?
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.200]   And guys, breaking up,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.820]   you're not just losing like a relationship,
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.160]   you are mourning a loss of a person.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.700]   It's not easy.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.500]   I'm not sitting here like, so go do this
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.980]   and you know, best of luck.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.340]   No, you will grieve, you will mourn.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:52.740]   You will start to like look at your phone,
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.300]   wondering like, when will the next text come?
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.260]   Oh wait, it's not coming.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.740]   I've experienced death.
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:02.340]   I've experienced people close to me dying.
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.720]   And when I experienced heartbreak, it was very similar.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.780]   I remember sitting there like, where are they?
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.880]   And then naturally you want to share something with them.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.340]   You want to text them something.
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.540]   At night, you're sitting there like wanting to call them.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.400]   And your driving songs come on,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.260]   all these different things are reminding you
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.420]   and you have to literally learn how to grieve
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.060]   and move on from that person that you lost.
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.740]   But I'm telling you, when you surrender that to God,
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.020]   there is hope.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.380]   He is enough.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.020]   He will sustain you.
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:37.020]   And this light temporary moment of hurt will lead to hope.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.280]   And when I am hurting and I'm losing perspective,
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.140]   I go to this scripture.
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.480]   Second Corinthians four, 16 through 18.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:49.000]   It says, that is why we never give up.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.900]   Though our bodies are dying,
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.220]   our spirits are being renewed every day.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:58.140]   For our present troubles are small and won't last very long.
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.620]   Yet they produce for us.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.220]   This is what our troubles, our heartbreak,
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.660]   here's what it produces in us.
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.860]   It produces for us a glory that vastly outweighs them
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.260]   and will last forever.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.980]   So we don't look at the troubles or the heartbreak.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.220]   We can see now rather we fix our gaze on things
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.260]   that cannot be seen.
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.300]   For the things that we see now will soon be gone,
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.940]   but the things we cannot see will last forever.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.820]   Here's what that means.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.580]   I get to not just look at my circumstances
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.980]   and look at my heartbreak and look at my breakup
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.680]   and look at all of the hurt and the loss
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.780]   and the things I'm experiencing.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.820]   Some of you right now are like,
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.140]   it would be nice to have some heartbreak.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.240]   It'd be nice to be broken up with.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.540]   I'm that desperate right now.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.220]   My singleness, I'm sitting here going,
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.380]   buddy, I haven't even been broken up with ever in my life.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.340]   And your heartbreak is going, why does no one want me?
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.220]   Why does no one choose me?
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.580]   That's where your heartbreak's coming from.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.380]   Some of you, your heartbreak's coming from parents,
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.220]   divorce, the way your dad treated you,
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.460]   the way your mom treated you, and it broke your heart.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.380]   Some of you have lost deep friendships to death
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:05.380]   or addictions or arguments, heartbreak.
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.500]   Some of you have been cheated on, abused.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.140]   I don't know what your story of heartbreak is tonight.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.340]   I don't know what your breakup has led to break you,
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.500]   but I know that there is hope
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.380]   on the other end of your surrender
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.940]   and the other end of your trust,
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.940]   and that hope, his name is Jesus.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.740]   And for some of you tonight, you're going,
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.820]   what do you mean my hope is in Jesus?
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.360]   And it's because you've been so distracted
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.480]   by all these relationships
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.140]   that have caused nothing but hurt and pain,
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.220]   and you've missed out on the greatest relationship
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.620]   that has ever been known on this planet.
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.100]   It is when God sent his son down to earth
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.820]   to have a relationship with us.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.820]   He walked in human flesh,
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:44.580]   and he lived a perfect life that none of us could live,
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.740]   which made him the perfect sacrifice to hang on a tree,
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.940]   a cross, and on that cross, a reminder for you,
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.640]   listen, if you're hurting, listen.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.780]   On that cross, he saw your heartbreak.
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.660]   He saw the abuse.
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.660]   He saw your parents' divorce.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.180]   He saw the cheating and the backstabbing
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.860]   and the gossip and the betrayal.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.780]   He saw you laying in your room alone,
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.940]   crying in your loneliness and in your singleness,
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.580]   and he took it on the cross.
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:23.180]   And he took that, not so you could lose hope.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:27.780]   He was broken, so in your brokenness,
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:32.440]   you could come and be made whole, be made new.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.500]   And so tonight you have a choice.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.480]   You can choose further pain.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.460]   You can go back to your addiction.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.700]   You can go back to your alcohol, to your drugs,
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.860]   to your pornography, to your bar hopping,
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.240]   to your hooking up, to your Tinder.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.780]   You can go back to it and you can choose death,
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:52.100]   but I'm begging you tonight to choose life, to choose hope.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.780]   He was broken.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.940]   Again, he was broken, murdered,
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.460]   buried in a tomb.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.280]   And he rose again, conquering death,
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.720]   conquering your heartbreak.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.560]   So that you don't have to go to the world
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.400]   with your brokenness.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   You can come to him.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:19.480]   And so tonight I ask you, as we respond in song,
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.520]   take some time and ask yourself,
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.600]   do I need to get out of this relationship
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.360]   and focus on the right relationship?
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.680]   Do I need to break up with blank?
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.960]   And then if you do, or if you've been broken up with,
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.580]   or if you're experiencing heartbreak right now
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:39.420]   in any way, shape or form, trust, surrender,
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.380]   bring the broken pieces to God
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.940]   and let him reset you and restore you.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.660]   Let's pray.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:54.700]   Father, thank you.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.380]   Thank you for sending your son to be broken.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:04.300]   Your word says that he was pierced for our transgressions.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.360]   He was crushed for our sins.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.540]   The punishment that brought us peace was on him
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.580]   and by his wounds, by his brokenness,
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.660]   we can come with our brokenness and be healed.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.660]   Freedom can come tonight.
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:25.440]   Hurt can turn into hope tonight.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.800]   Not by our own power, not by some process
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.820]   or some system or by some ritual.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.700]   No, it can come tonight by simply believing
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:39.700]   that your death was enough to cover all of the hurt.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:46.940]   So for those tonight who need to reset their life on you,
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:51.420]   I pray tonight that they would.
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.660]   In this moment right here,
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:56.300]   I pray that you would restore the broken pieces.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.800]   In your name that I pray, amen.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.380]   (gentle music)
