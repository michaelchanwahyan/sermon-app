[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.340]   - Hi Porsche, my name's Harrison Ross.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.760]   I'm on staff here at Watermark.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.520]   I'm excited to be with you tonight.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.400]   We're gonna dive in.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.560]   Who here likes art?
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.240]   Anybody in here like art?
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.840]   Some fans of art?
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.680]   I love art.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.600]   I grew up going to museums with my mom
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.920]   and it's not the thing most kids are playing on playgrounds
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.400]   and we're sitting quiet in a museum.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.200]   But I learned to love art.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.320]   And one of my favorite artists that is out there today
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.560]   is not the typical ones you'd see in a museum.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.000]   He's not a Da Vinci or a Monet or a Rembrandt.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.200]   His name is Banksy.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.720]   Anybody familiar with Banksy?
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.280]   Some yes, some no.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.160]   He is a notorious figure in the art culture
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.280]   because he is a street artist.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.560]   So he's a graffiti artist.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.520]   He does tagging.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.080]   He does these huge mural artworks
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.920]   that is more of a social commentary.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.280]   He's kind of poking fun at the urbanization
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.680]   of our environments and the things that happen
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.200]   when you're in an urban culture.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.140]   So here are a couple pieces by Banksy.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.040]   This is kind of just, as you see,
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040]   a kid has to play on a fire hydrant
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.220]   because there's nowhere else to go.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.480]   That's the fun and games.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.800]   Another one is all of our parks are really parking lots.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.720]   So he just does these tongue-in-cheek things.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.800]   So one thing that he did, he's based in the UK.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.240]   He's a London-based artist.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.200]   He came to the States, to New York, for 30 days
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.080]   to do an installation every day for 30 days.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.320]   This was one of 'em, where he just poked fun
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.440]   at the graffiti in New York City and said,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.000]   this is my New York accent,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.760]   but this is normally how I talk.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.000]   And so he just does stuff like this all over the globe.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880]   While he was in New York City,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.880]   this pop-up shop popped up on one of the days
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.120]   full of what looked like Banksy artwork.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.720]   And so if you've ever been in New York City,
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.080]   there are these little shops all over the city
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.440]   that they're selling little trinkets,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.560]   they're selling souvenirs,
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.640]   they're selling really cheap artwork, whatever it is.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.080]   So this is on the outside of Central Park.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.760]   And there is this shop with an old man that you saw
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.040]   who was just yawning, bored to tears,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.900]   selling what seems to be way overpriced artwork
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.120]   compared to all of the other cheap trinkets around it.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.120]   $60 for a spray-painted stencil on a canvas.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.560]   Would you pay that?
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.000]   Thousands of people walk by this booth in one day.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.040]   It sat there for one day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.360]   Thousands of people walk by and see $60, nah.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.080]   So in the span of a whole day,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.720]   and this yawning old man, two people buy a painting.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.320]   Two people think that what they see is worth something,
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.340]   is valuable, is something that they would wanna have.
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.320]   Because in this city full of cheap trinkets
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.800]   and a park full of gimmicks and tricks
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.360]   and T-shirts and novelties,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.400]   $60 seemed way too expensive, way too high of a value
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.160]   for what really was undervalued by everybody else.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.800]   Anybody in here feel like that painting
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.200]   or that group of paintings?
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.440]   Wanting to be wanted?
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.800]   Wanting to feel like you're worth something?
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.640]   Maybe 60, maybe more?
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.120]   Everyone just kinda walks by?
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.320]   Nah, maybe a couple glance, maybe a couple want you
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.160]   and you get excited and then it just moves on
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.740]   and there's nothing about you that seems exciting
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.180]   or lovable.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.720]   In a world full of hurt and sin and selfishness,
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.520]   people may look at you, you may even look at yourself
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.400]   and think that you are worthless.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.800]   Because these people would walk around
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.280]   and they'd undervalue artwork.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.880]   I think we tend to look at things that are in this world
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.440]   and we undervalue a lot, it's easy.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.880]   But I think the things that we undervalue most
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.180]   are ourselves.
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.320]   I think what you undervalue most is you.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.960]   You think that who you are, how you look,
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.200]   the job that you have, the friends that you hang out,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.120]   you think that all of that is this perfect symphony
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.920]   that says I'm not good enough, I'm not enough.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.040]   And so we look for value in how much we make,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.880]   what others think about us, what we do.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.500]   Our peace of mind is determined by our relationship status,
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.400]   by the car that we drive, what our boss thinks about you,
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.480]   what you look in the mirror and think about yourself.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.300]   And it usually is, well, I feel worthless.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.120]   Whether I have nothing or whether I have everything
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.020]   in the world, but we try to just fill this feeling
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.020]   to feel valued by stuff, by things, by relationships,
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.900]   by careers, by career shifts, by changing cities,
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.860]   by doing anything and everything we can,
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.860]   fulfilling sexual desires, just binge watching Netflix
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.260]   to numb everything, to eat everything in sight.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.100]   Whatever it is, we try to fill our lives to think
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.960]   maybe that will give me value,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.020]   maybe that will help me feel worth something.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.920]   Tonight I wanna talk about your value.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.160]   I think it's something that we all wrestle with.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.580]   It's core to who we are, it's our identity.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.040]   It's something that each of us,
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.920]   as we're standing in the morning brushing our teeth,
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.320]   I have a sonic hair, shameless plug for dentists out there.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   I have a sonic hair and I have to stand there
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.380]   for two minutes and stare at the mirror.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.480]   And if I'm honest, when I look at myself
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.840]   and I judge my love handles or whatever it is,
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.520]   the question that we all have,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.740]   whether we're brushing our teeth or laying in bed is,
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.020]   do I really matter?
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.360]   Am I worth something?
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.240]   Do I have a purpose on this earth?
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.280]   Do I have value to anyone else?
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.760]   Do I even look at myself and think
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.200]   that I have value for myself?
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.440]   Our value is not determined by what others think about us.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.660]   We're not valuable because of how anyone around you sees you,
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.120]   how you see yourself,
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.400]   but how the creator of the universe sees you.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.840]   And what he says is that you are valuable,
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.900]   that you are the most valuable thing on this earth.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.380]   And he is willing to give anything
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.300]   and everything that it takes
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.900]   because he says that you're valuable.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.740]   If you got your Bibles,
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.780]   we're gonna be studying Ephesians 2.10 tonight.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.700]   You can pull that out.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.100]   We'll have it on the screen.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.380]   We're gonna look at one verse
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.060]   and we're gonna unpack that together.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.200]   But here's the first thing that you need to know.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.620]   The God of the universe, the creator of the universe
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.580]   calls you his masterpiece.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.300]   You are his masterpiece.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.060]   Ephesians 2.10, it starts out like this.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.640]   For we are God's workmanship.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.340]   That word workmanship in the Greek,
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.740]   in the original translation that they wrote this in,
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.420]   it's called, it says poema.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.980]   That word poema is where we get the term poem.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.700]   That's where a lot of this artwork-themed things
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.180]   that we get in our culture comes from.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.100]   And it means handiwork, workmanship,
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.100]   craftsmanship, masterpiece.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.500]   That doesn't mean you're perfect.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.060]   That doesn't mean that there's nothing about you
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.940]   that needs to change.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.920]   That doesn't mean that there aren't things
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.880]   that are shifting.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.780]   It means that out of what an artist creates,
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.580]   you are the crowning, defining, best work.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.640]   Out of the portfolio of all the things
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.020]   that this artist has made,
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.100]   the masterpiece is the best of creation,
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.220]   the best thing that is put on display
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.540]   that everyone remembers and it points to him
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.380]   and they remember him forever for it.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.540]   That's you, his masterpiece.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.980]   For a summer, I worked as a dude ranch in Wyoming.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.580]   So what I would get to do,
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.240]   instead of sleeping in an apartment or a house in Dallas
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.240]   where we really have no beautiful things
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.460]   other than great food,
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.780]   I would get to wake up and go on top of a mountain
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.620]   and I'd go while it's still dark
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.900]   and I would sit there and I would watch the world wake up
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.740]   and I would watch God paint a beautiful picture
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.300]   of a sunrise every day.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.580]   As the sun slowly starts to rise,
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.300]   I could see more mountains coming in the distance
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.260]   and I would see these color schemes
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.700]   and I would see these shadings and these shadows.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.120]   It was the most beautiful place I had ever seen.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:38.380]   I don't know if you're a mountain guy or girl.
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.460]   I don't know if you're into the beach.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.700]   I don't know what it is that you think
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.900]   is the most beautiful thing of creation.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.460]   But Genesis 1 talks that God is the creator.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.820]   He created the heavens and the earth
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.660]   and everything that we see, the animals,
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.220]   the majestic things, the sunrise and sunset,
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.940]   every day and out of all that God created,
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.120]   you are the best of creation.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.940]   You are his masterpiece.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.900]   You believe that?
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.500]   I don't.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.260]   I don't.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.140]   I mean, it inspires me.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.580]   I know it.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.100]   I know it is true in Scripture.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.860]   I know it is true in this verse.
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.040]   But if I'm honest with myself and with you,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.780]   I don't believe that about myself
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.580]   when I'm brushing my teeth in the mirror in the morning.
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.380]   I feel like a failure.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.460]   I feel like a fake.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.780]   I feel like I don't even like myself most days
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.620]   when I'm looking at it.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.700]   And so really, I need to hear this message as much as you.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.880]   I don't know where you are tonight.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.060]   I don't know what you're thinking,
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.620]   what thoughts that you have going through your mind.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.620]   Do you feel like a masterpiece?
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.220]   God calls you his masterpiece.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:54.740]   If I'm such a masterpiece,
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.740]   then why does my body look like this?
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.940]   I mean, supermodels are a masterpiece.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.340]   Sure, I get that.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.900]   But you see this body that I got?
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.040]   You're talking about love handles.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.940]   I've got some love handles that are unlovable, buddy.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.760]   Check this out.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.000]   I'm no masterpiece.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.940]   If I'm so much of a masterpiece,
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.140]   then why am I still single
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.140]   while all my friends are getting married?
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.620]   If I'm so much of a masterpiece,
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.740]   then why does my life suck?
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.320]   You see the car I drive?
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.120]   All my friends have this push button start.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.860]   I don't have a button I can push on my fob.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.780]   I'm still putting in a car key
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.300]   that I got to get from Home Depot
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.420]   'cause I lost the other one.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.500]   I'm still stuck in the 1980s in this thing.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.700]   We're coming up on summer
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.040]   and I have to get a spray fan
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.840]   to just keep from not sweating.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.480]   I'm either gonna sweat or be soaking wet.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.280]   Either way, my life sucks.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.580]   Masterpiece.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.220]   You know where I work?
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.040]   I'm not slinging pizzas around and delivering pizzas,
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.540]   but I'd rather do that than the job that I hate.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.180]   I hate myself because of where I work.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.360]   If I'm so much of a masterpiece, what about that?
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.600]   If I'm so much of a masterpiece,
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.560]   then why do I feel like my boss tears me apart
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.920]   every time I meet with him?
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.600]   If I'm so much of a masterpiece,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.860]   then why did he break up with me
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.300]   when I thought I'd marry him?
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.940]   If I'm so much of a masterpiece,
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.140]   why do I get rejected by every girl that I ask out?
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.780]   I don't see me as a masterpiece.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.180]   How can God see me as a masterpiece?
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.920]   Well, maybe you are the masterpiece
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.380]   that everyone's trying to be.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.160]   Maybe you don't look at yourself and go,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.200]   man, my life's terrible.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.000]   Maybe you're going, yeah.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.800]   Valet'd my Tesla or Range Rover on the way in here.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.500]   Fresh press suit, beautiful girlfriend.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.840]   Yeah, I am that masterpiece,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.780]   but if I'm so much of that masterpiece,
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.740]   then why do I really hate myself?
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.840]   If I am this masterpiece that most everyone else
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.180]   in this room wants to be, why do I still feel no value?
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.720]   I've got more money than any of my friends around me,
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.700]   but I am nowhere near happy.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.700]   I finally got the job and the promotion
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.320]   that I've been working for for three years
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.060]   and had no life to get,
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.260]   but I don't feel any more valued or loved.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.940]   I've got the girlfriend that everyone thinks
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.280]   is the most beautiful in the world,
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.140]   but I don't feel valued.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.320]   Masterpiece?
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.480]   Me?
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.080]   Masterpiece of crap, maybe,
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:46.620]   but God calls you his masterpiece.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.060]   The reason that we don't feel like a masterpiece
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.400]   is because we're looking to all the wrong things
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.640]   to give us value.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.600]   You're looking all around you.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.040]   You're looking within you.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.140]   You're looking to the stuff, to the things,
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.200]   to the desires, the fulfillment.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.500]   You're looking at everything that will fill you,
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.000]   all of what will fill you,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.040]   and the reason you're not being fulfilled
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.340]   and feeling valued is because you're not looking
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.040]   to the person who can.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.920]   You're looking to you.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.180]   You're looking to everyone else and everything else,
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.660]   because the truth is God is the one who gives you value.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.400]   He calls you his masterpiece,
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.500]   and he gives you value because he is the artist of your life.
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.340]   He's the best artist that ever created.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.160]   Better than Kanye, don't tell him.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.900]   Better than Rembrandt, Monet, Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Picasso.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.880]   Better than any artist that has ever lived,
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.040]   and he has a purpose for your life, a plan for your life.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.680]   He has a perfect picture in mind of what he wants for you.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.220]   He's forming you, shaping you, molding you,
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.260]   intentionally creating a beautiful picture
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.600]   with every stroke, every color.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.660]   Every gift, every talent,
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.400]   every way he created you is purposeful,
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.100]   because he's the artist, not you.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.740]   You don't define your value.
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:22.840]   We want to, we try to, we think we can, we would rather,
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.680]   but God is the one who gives you value.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.820]   God is the one who created you in the first place.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.420]   Psalm 139 talks about he has knit you in his mother's womb.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.680]   He has formed you, he has shaped you.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.320]   He already made you.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.220]   But we then try to turn around and think that,
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.560]   well, we're not good enough, I don't feel that value,
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.960]   I'm not enough, and so I've gotta do something
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.560]   that's gonna make me feel valuable.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:54.140]   If you've ever been to a museum,
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.300]   you see all these pictures hanging on a wall,
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.980]   some of them really well-known,
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.420]   some of them not so well-known,
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.880]   and you could step away and go,
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.140]   wow, this is wonderful,
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.180]   but if you ever go really up close to a painting,
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.780]   it really kinda sucks.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.920]   I don't care who the painter is.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.320]   You go up close, and if you've never seen from far away,
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.120]   my own judgmental eye can just go,
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.700]   okay, this is a bunch of random brush strokes,
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:23.100]   globs of paint, random colors that are put together.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.640]   There's nothing special about this,
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.840]   but when you step away,
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.780]   you see that there is a picture
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.340]   that someone other than the viewer or the canvas itself
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.640]   has perfectly put in place
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.780]   because it followed a plan that he had.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.760]   What seemed like random strokes and crazy colors
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.620]   and things that don't seem to fit together
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.620]   form to be a beautiful picture and a masterpiece.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.860]   Up close, when we look at ourselves
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.040]   or allow others to look at us or we look at others,
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.340]   we may seem like there's nothing special,
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.540]   but when you look from God's perspective,
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.640]   because he created you and he is the artist of your life,
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.940]   he gives you value and defines that you are good.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:09.640]   For you are his workmanship, Ephesians 2:10 says.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.480]   It goes on to say, created in Christ Jesus.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.680]   He has already made you
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.680]   when you came out of your mother's womb,
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.220]   but then he creates us anew in Christ Jesus,
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.100]   but we don't even like that,
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.660]   and we try to be our own artist.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.460]   It seems kind of controlling of God
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.860]   if he's up there with the paintbrushes,
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.040]   and so what we try to do is go over
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.080]   and snatch the paintbrush out of his hand
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.340]   and go, all right, God, you know what?
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.740]   This plan that you've got for me
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.940]   is not really working out for me,
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.340]   so I'm gonna take it from here.
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.280]   Good, good, up there.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.280]   You're turning into Harry Potter, whatever it is.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.480]   And we think that we are gonna create a masterpiece
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.480]   greater than he can.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.320]   Well, good luck.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.100]   So let's pretend this is me.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.400]   This canvas is my life,
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.200]   and on here is my plan for my life.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.500]   On here is when I'm a kid, what I dreamt of being,
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.140]   what I thought one day I'll grow up,
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.980]   I'll be the first man on Mars, fail.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.680]   I am terrible at math, and it's never gonna happen.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.620]   SpaceX will get there, Harrison will not get there.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.120]   This is my plan for my life.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.760]   I'm not gonna be a World Cup soccer player,
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.520]   but I can continue along the path that I have for me
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.220]   or that I think God would have me go on.
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.220]   And so through junior high and high school,
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.000]   I grew up in a good Christian family,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.960]   and I go along the road and I try to follow this path,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.100]   and I'm going along, and it's good, it's vibrant,
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.980]   it's colorful, it's bright, it's fun.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.480]   I became a believer when I was really young.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.380]   I came to know Jesus and I found life in him
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.940]   and knowing the Bible stories
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.340]   and knowing all of these things.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.460]   And I started to run with some friends in high school,
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.860]   at least I thought they were friends.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.560]   In college, it started to come into more of a picture
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.800]   of what I wanted to do, what I thought I would do,
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.500]   and along the way, I started to see growth.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.960]   I started to see that people liked me.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.060]   I started to see, man, this is kind of working out.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.340]   I like this brush.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.400]   This is nice.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.880]   This is a picture that I wanna fill in.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.480]   I'd love to go down this road.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.780]   This feels good.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.580]   People like me, they affirm me, they wanna be around me.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.480]   And so I started going to church
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.220]   'cause that's where all my friends were going,
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.460]   and what do you do?
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.260]   And I started growing, or at least saying I was.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.660]   And I started getting involved in college
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.100]   and all these organizations,
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.260]   and again, people were liking me,
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.640]   and it seemed like on the outside, all was going well.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.540]   I started dating a girl, junior in high school.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.700]   She's so hot.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.340]   I can say that because we were prom king and queen together
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.880]   and then she became my wife and she's still so hot,
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.140]   hotter than ever.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.640]   And so my life was really going great.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.180]   But see, all the while, on the outside,
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.520]   you're looking at my picture and you're like,
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.060]   okay, dude, that's really not that awesome,
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.560]   but I thought it was.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.920]   But all the while, what's kind of creeping in there
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.220]   in this little vibrancy of my life in Christ,
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.460]   right in the middle is this secret addiction to pornography.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.500]   But hey, all the rest is good.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.840]   It's just a little blemish.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.040]   It's not even a solar eclipse.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.880]   We're fine.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.100]   So I move on and I keep going through college
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.980]   and I try to keep looking for accolades
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.580]   and I then try to go into the working world
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.980]   and I end up marrying the wife of my youth
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.580]   and we're growing and it's going great.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:47.360]   But still this little thing starts creeping in,
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.500]   starts filling in down over here.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.860]   This little clicking in high school
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.200]   turned into a 12-year addiction of pornography for me.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.400]   So that maybe there was growth on this side,
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.780]   but the growth was being stunted over here.
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:05.680]   So then I get into the working world
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.320]   and I'm really enjoying what I'm doing
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.880]   and it seems kind of good,
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.980]   but this growth is kind of starting to look a little darker
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.720]   because when I look at myself in the mirror,
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.120]   I'm not really loving what I see.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.460]   I seem successful.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.000]   I had friends,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.060]   but I didn't really have any close friends.
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.560]   I had success in high school, success in the work world.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.440]   I had a relationship and a wife,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.600]   but deep down I didn't really like it.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.840]   I was full of depression.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:41.520]   Although I had this addiction that I really struggled with,
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.680]   I had friends who helped me
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.620]   and there was some growth over here,
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.520]   but growth was kind of still in and out of it,
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.580]   in and out of struggling with that.
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.180]   Even today, I haven't been there for 12 years.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.760]   I know the truth of who Jesus is,
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.720]   but most days, if I'm honest,
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.520]   I'd really love to go look at porn.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.120]   It makes me feel valuable.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.360]   It makes me feel wanted.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.900]   I have a wife who loves me.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.000]   I have a savior who loves me,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.800]   but every day I have this desire to go,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.400]   man, I could go have an entire worldwide web want me.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.780]   And then I have this lingering prideful thoughts
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.540]   and all of these things that are creeping through my life.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.280]   Again, I feel in my job like a failure.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.680]   I feel depressed.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.720]   I feel like I'm not really loving what I'm doing most times.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.960]   When I look in the mirror, that's what I see,
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.460]   but I'm at church.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.960]   So then I just try to mask it.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.240]   I just try to pray more.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.100]   I just try to read more Bible.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.780]   I just try to go to church more and go to the porch more.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.540]   I try to give more money.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.740]   I try to make it look like that addiction has gone away.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.420]   I try to look like I'm doing all the right things,
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.920]   but all these good works that I thought
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.560]   would make things new are just clouding in my picture.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.160]   No matter how hard I try on the stuff
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.800]   that I've already done or even on the new stuff up here,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.500]   my picture really doesn't look anything
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.080]   like when I first started.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.440]   So I go, you know what?
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.040]   I'm just gonna start over.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.740]   I'm just gonna create a new me.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.420]   It's 2018, New Year's resolutions.
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.240]   We're gonna start over.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.080]   All that's behind me.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.180]   I'm just gonna wipe it all away.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.560]   I'm gonna get rid of it.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.060]   We're gonna start fresh.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.560]   It's a new Harrison.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.920]   It's a new me.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.560]   No more bad things.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.560]   And I'll just kinda start fresh,
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.100]   and now my picture is almost completely unrecognizable
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.700]   from what it was before.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:23:02.140]   Now I'm no art expert, but that's a masterpiece.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:08.780]   Anybody crazy enough to buy this panty?
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.660]   I'll give it to you for 60 bucks.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.480]   Yeah?
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.420]   Come see me afterwards.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.920]   It's yours.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.160]   I'm gonna get away.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.860]   I should start preaching more often.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.060]   I look at my life knowing full well
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.500]   of what God says of me that I'm his masterpiece,
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.240]   and when I look at me in the mirror,
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   all I see is a mess.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.440]   All I see is a disaster.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.780]   I don't see a work of art
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.940]   that is worthy of being displayed,
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.580]   worthy of being paid for,
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.240]   worthy of even being given away.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.820]   I see trash.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.120]   'Cause when I try and take the paintbrushes,
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.680]   when I try to fill in my life,
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.320]   I take it from God,
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.760]   what ends up happening is I make a disaster of my life.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.200]   In the good things that I do,
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.300]   in the great things that I wanna accomplish,
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.300]   in the things that start to creep in and crowd my life
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.100]   and darken my world,
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.540]   I made a mess out of my life,
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:07.600]   and so did you.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.880]   But Jesus recreates us.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.080]   Jesus isn't gonna just let us stay there.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.280]   This context of Ephesians 2:10
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.240]   is in the wider context of a passage,
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.920]   and I just wanna read it for you
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.780]   because it's a passage that has incredibly marked my life,
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.680]   the truth in Ephesians 2:10
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.620]   because of the truth in one through nine,
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.020]   and you need to see it.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.400]   Here's what it says.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.360]   You were dead in the trespasses and sins
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.760]   in which you once walked,
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.260]   following the course of this world,
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.400]   following the prince of the power of the air,
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.540]   the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience,
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.400]   among whom we all once lived,
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.940]   in the passions of our flesh,
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.740]   carrying out the desires of the body and of the mind,
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.320]   and were by nature children of wrath
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.020]   like the rest of mankind, but God.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.660]   One through three is my life.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.220]   One through three is where some of you sit.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.860]   But I don't create myself.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.040]   God does.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.240]   Verse four, it says,
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.540]   "But God, being rich in mercy
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.800]   "because of the great love with which he loved us
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.080]   "even when we were dead in our trespasses,
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.480]   "made us alive together with Christ.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.080]   "It is by grace that you have been saved
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.280]   "and raised us up with him,
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.220]   "seated us with him in the heavenly places
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.820]   "in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.680]   "he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.560]   "and kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.860]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith."
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.560]   This is not of your own doing.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.540]   This is nothing you can do to make yourself better,
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.900]   to work yourself into anything.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.240]   This is the gift of God,
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.140]   not a result of works so that no one may boast,
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.140]   for we are his workmanship,
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:11.320]   created in Christ Jesus for good works
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.220]   so that we may walk in them.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.580]   Jesus recreates us into his masterpiece.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.120]   We can come to him.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.320]   We can ask him.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.060]   We can say, "Lord, I don't feel like I have any value
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.800]   "or anything I try to add value
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.900]   "is doing anything in my life but making a mess,
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.300]   "so I want you to come in."
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.500]   And when we pray that,
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.500]   we think that Jesus is gonna come in
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.600]   and just fix this little area right here.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.740]   Okay.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.500]   That was good.
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.340]   That's all I can handle.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.580]   And so I pray again the next day,
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.980]   and I think that my little Jesus is gonna come in
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.820]   and maybe he'll just smooth this out.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.660]   Maybe he'll bring a little of the old vibrant life
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.160]   into some of the new life.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.000]   We picture Jesus sometimes
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.400]   as this tiny little toothbrush of a God
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.960]   that comes in to fix our tiny blemishes
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.100]   because that's all he's big enough to do.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.600]   That's not my God.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.840]   That's not Jesus.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.180]   Jesus came and he died for me.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.980]   He came and he died for you.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.540]   Not to come and just make little parts of your life better,
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.920]   but he came to make you a new creation.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.720]   He came to make you his masterpiece,
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.280]   regardless of what you've done,
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.680]   regardless of what you will do,
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.460]   regardless of how you see yourself,
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.320]   how anyone around you sees you,
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.820]   regardless if you think that you are
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.120]   the most unlovable person in the room or on the planet,
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.400]   he died for you.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.340]   He came to earth, he dwelt among us.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.660]   He then allowed himself to be nailed to a tree,
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:50.440]   crucified to die so that his blood could cover you
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.940]   so that your life is not just fixed
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.940]   by a couple little brushstrokes of his grace,
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.220]   but so that your life, all the screw-ups and mess-ups
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.380]   and everything that could be is dumped
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.380]   in the goodness of who God is,
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.160]   in his grace, in his love, in his kindness,
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.560]   in his goodness.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.060]   (congregation applauding)
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:18.200]   So that as you look at your life,
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.800]   all that was there fades away.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.340]   All that is there that could make you feel unlovable
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.240]   or worthless disappears and all you see is Jesus.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.180]   When God looks at you, he doesn't see a mess-up,
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.120]   he doesn't see a screw-up, he sees Jesus.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:46.960]   He sees the blood of his son that was poured out for you
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:53.200]   so that you could know that you are his masterpiece.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:00.040]   What God doesn't do is make the canvas disappear,
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.740]   make it all fade away or make it go white again,
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.720]   but red runs all over this place
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.040]   because his grace is what sets us free.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.320]   His grace is what gives us life.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.780]   God is the artist of your life, not you.
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.420]   He defines your value.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:24.120]   And guys, what art is supposed to do
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.360]   is art glorifies the creator.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.900]   Art is meant to be on display.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.840]   It's at rest.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   It doesn't do anything.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.240]   It hangs on a wall and it just is on display
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.680]   for what the artist intended it to be,
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.480]   intended for it to do.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:48.860]   It doesn't look for value from the museum-goer.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.360]   It doesn't sit there on a wall and just go,
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.920]   is someone gonna like me today?
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.800]   Do you think more people are gonna come and want me?
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.460]   More people are gonna wanna read their pamphlet
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.400]   and think that I'm worth something and valuable?
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.760]   You think that people are gonna come
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.880]   and think that I'm good or better
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.240]   than the ones next to me?
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.440]   I mean, how crazy would it be
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.820]   if the Mona Lisa is sitting in its little
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.280]   like plexiglass cage, hanging on that wall
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:22.620]   and goes, man, I really wish Da Vinci
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.820]   would've given me a more timeless hairstyle.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.920]   I really wish he would've made me look a little less frumpy.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.400]   I really wish that my color palette
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.400]   was a little more like my modern art friends over there.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.940]   Or Starry Nights, hanging on the wall
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:39.340]   and just going, man, I'm not that clear.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.680]   I'm not a realist painting.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.240]   I'm a little blurry and splotchy
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.280]   and no one can really tell what I am.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.980]   Man, I wish that someone could actually care for me.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.120]   These are some of the most widely known paintings
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.180]   in the whole world.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.560]   It sounds ridiculous because many of us
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.620]   just look around and go, well, she's getting married.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.960]   How come I'm not?
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.400]   He's got the job that he loves.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.260]   How come I don't?
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.460]   Everyone else feels like they're getting invited
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.300]   and they're living a life of their dreams.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.840]   How come I am not?
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.400]   And we're looking to find value all around us
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.400]   instead of the value that God has given us to walk in.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:18.580]   The end of that verse says that you are created
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.620]   in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.920]   which he prepared beforehand so that you could walk in them.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:31.600]   Art is at rest because it doesn't have to do anything.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.360]   It doesn't have to prove itself.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.760]   It doesn't have to make itself new
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.500]   or remake itself into something else
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.000]   so that someone will value it.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.840]   It is who the creator made it and it is at rest
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.240]   and it does nothing.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.240]   Guys, your purpose is to glorify God,
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.040]   exactly how he's made you, uniquely how he's made you.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.620]   When he created you, he specifically thought
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.920]   of what you would look like, who you would be,
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.760]   the personality you would have,
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.900]   the gifts that you would have,
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.360]   the skills that you would have,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.000]   and he put you uniquely on this earth
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.100]   for you to glorify him in ways that no one else could.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.200]   There's lots of different kinds of art out there,
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.540]   realism, impressionism, statues, pottery,
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.500]   little tiny cloth paintings.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.640]   All of us are unique.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.440]   All of us are created with different gifts
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.940]   and abilities and desires and things that we love
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.220]   and things that we can give love to others,
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.320]   but all of us are his masterpiece
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.080]   put here to be on display for his glory.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:37.360]   God made you.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.740]   Walk in it.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:46.300]   God made you his masterpiece.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.540]   Go be the Mona Lisa.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.600]   Be the starry night.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.780]   Be all that God made you to be.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.940]   Be Jessica.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.440]   Be Samuel.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.640]   Be Zach.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.620]   Be Hannah.
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:06.520]   Be who God uniquely made you and glorify him in it
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.920]   because he defines your value as the artist of your life
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.200]   and he calls you his masterpiece.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.600]   [congregation laughing]
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.940]   In that situation in New York,
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.000]   people are walking by this booth
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.640]   of all these different paintings
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.280]   and throughout the whole day,
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.280]   two people bought paintings for $60.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.360]   Seemed a little more than what maybe
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.060]   the other people thought they were worth.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:39.060]   The next day, art experts realized what had happened
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.400]   and they were authentic Banksy artworks
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.860]   that each was valued at around $31,000.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.940]   And so for one day in the middle of Central Park,
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.140]   there was a booth set up of what's estimated
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.980]   around $250 million worth of artwork
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.740]   that most people just walked by and said,
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.580]   "That seems worthless."
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.280]   That's the world we live in, guys.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:08.260]   Whether you see yourself, the person next to you,
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.560]   your roommate or how any else sees you,
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.520]   we undervalue who we think we are
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.740]   or defined by the value of everything else around us
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.700]   because we don't know the artist.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:25.780]   God wrote his signature on your life
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.080]   for those who know him and have trusted in him
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.820]   and choose to walk in his ways
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.820]   and surrender your life to him
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.780]   and he calls you his masterpiece,
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.680]   signed in his blood and he washes it all away.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.580]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.180]   For we are his workmanship,
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.680]   created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.160]   which he prepared beforehand so that we may walk in it.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:55.200]   Go, walk in it, be his people.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.300]   Let me pray.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.400]   Heavenly Father, we love you.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.240]   Thank you that you love us, that you created us,
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.300]   you have formed us, you have shaped us,
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.680]   you have made us in the likeness of who you are.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.120]   Lord, even though we try to define our life
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.540]   based on the things around us
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.180]   or the things that we see in ourselves,
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.080]   none of that is gonna give us value.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.960]   None of that is gonna give us worth,
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.980]   only by how you see us.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.820]   Nothing that we can do, nothing that we can fix
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.760]   from our past or do in our future,
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.100]   but all what you have already done for us.
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.540]   So Lord, thank you for the blood of Jesus
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:40.040]   that washes over our lives and makes us a new creation,
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.080]   that we are your children and we are your masterpiece.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.320]   God, I pray for people in here who do not feel that.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.980]   Maybe they know it, but they absolutely do not feel that.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.620]   By your spirit, Lord, I pray that they would know
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.260]   that you love them, you're crazy about them.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.200]   And I pray that you'd call them to yourself.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.400]   I pray for people in here who do know you,
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.200]   but just don't believe that truth
