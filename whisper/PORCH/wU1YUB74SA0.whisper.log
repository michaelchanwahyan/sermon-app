[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   Good evening and welcome to the porch. I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.120]   world of relationships. Can we cue some music please? From our friendships to our romantic
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.600]   endeavors, we'll explore our family bonds, estranged relationships, work dynamics, and
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.760]   perhaps even the relationship with oneself. So how do we relate? To answer this, we'll look to
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.560]   scripture and find exactly what God has to say about our relationships. This is, after all,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.600]   the Relationship Series. Porch, how we doing? We doing okay tonight? It's great to see you. It's
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.760]   great to be back. We are in the Relationship Series. If this is your first time being a part
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.960]   of the series and you're not too late, we've got a little bit more for you. Dallas, you look good.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.920]   Grateful you're in the room. But everybody that's tuning in online, like we love that God is doing
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.760]   something special here in our city, but he's doing something special all over the globe.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.400]   Literally, the stories we get, they're crazy. And so we're grateful that y'all would trust us
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.480]   with your evening and you would be a part of what God is doing here. Special shout out to
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.880]   Porch Live, Dayton, Wheaton, and Des Moines. All right, to start things off, I want to play a
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.680]   little game with all of you. Does that sound okay? So everybody stand up and look around at the
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.080]   people standing to your left and your right. We're going to be doing a lot of this here in this
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.600]   game. So it's good just to prove to one another that you are actually capable of standing up.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.720]   Now everybody sit down for me. You just proved you could do it and now I'm going to put you to
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:54.520]   the test. I want you to stand up. Oh man. This is going to be exposing for some of you. I want
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:04.520]   you to stand up if you think Crocs are actually an acceptable form of fashion. That's bold.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:13.120]   You're bold. All right, sit down for me. Sit down. You can judge and appeal to your friends
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   later on. I want you to stand up if you actually believe cats are better companions than dogs.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:31.240]   Loud and proud down here in the front. Our feline friends, Mr. Ben Craychee as well. All
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.160]   right. It's getting a little hotter in here. We'll keep turning up the heat. I want you to
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.160]   stand up if you own an Android instead of an iPhone. The few and the proud. There they are. You
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:54.740]   know, I'll give it to my Android users. We always know our Android users because they simply
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.620]   make themselves known. They think they have something to brag about but we all know that's
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.620]   not the case. I want you to stand up if you use Apple Music instead of Spotify. Oh my gosh.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:15.700]   Micaela, no! Oh no. Okay, okay, okay, okay. For my Apple Music users, I have to ask, I have to
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:29.700]   ask, why? It is inferior to Spotify. It absolutely is. All right, stand up if you prefer working
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.940]   from the office than working at home. I'm already standing up but I'm like, I'm trying to get up
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.940]   as much as I can because I love being in the office. I love being around people. All right.
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.740]   Grab a seat. Last one. Last one. And this one is really big. So hey, I need you all to lean in
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.520]   and really engage with this one because we're going to turn a corner into something really
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.980]   significant here. I need you to stand up if you're actually single and ready to mingle. No,
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.980]   no, no, I'm just kidding. Don't do that. Don't do that. That is one opportunity here at the
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:17.360]   porch but we are about other more significant things than that. Okay. Here's why we did that.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.820]   We just learned a lot about one another, right? You just learned where your peers stand on some
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.460]   pretty important subjects. You were able to size them up and you were able to stack yourself in
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.900]   comparison to them. And while this was super lighthearted and it was a really good time,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:44.380]   here's the thing. Oftentimes, comparison is anything but lighthearted and fun.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.580]   It's interesting. If you go and you read the research, studies show that roughly 10% of
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.100]   normal human thought is comparative in nature, which if you look at the average human life,
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.220]   which would be roughly 77 years, 10% of 77 years equates to five years of total life.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.340]   That means five years of your life you are spending comparing yourself to other people.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:19.020]   I don't know how that sits with you. That's alarming to me. Like the thought that I'm giving
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:27.020]   up five years of myself to comparing me to some of you jokers? No, thank you. You know what,
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:34.380]   I'm just kidding. This is the way that we work though. Like hardwired under the heart of humanity
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.460]   is this need to stack up against other people to measure ourselves against one another. And the
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.660]   world knows it. Like the world knows that this is a meaningful way in which we relate to one
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.940]   another. Like we live in a society that not only accepts comparison as a way in which we interact,
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.860]   but actually has commodified, commercialized comparison through celebrity culture that's
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.100]   telling you how you're supposed to live your life or self-help books that are trying to
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.420]   advocate your personal development or a specially manicured social media feed. That way you can
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.940]   see who it is that you should be stacking yourself alongside. Our world knows that this is something
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.100]   that is meaningful for us. And truthfully, we don't need to look at the culture to realize that
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.500]   comparison is a problem. We just need to look at ourselves. Like some of you can relate to the fact
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.140]   that that guy at the office, like he got the promotion even though he wasn't even trying for
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.540]   it. Like you were the one that were staying late and burning the midnight oil and making sure the
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.100]   candle wick was lit at both ends and giving as much as possible because you really wanted to
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.740]   get into that position to achieve that promotion. Others of you have a friend who was totally
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.540]   content in their season of singleness. You know, like man, I'm fully and undividedly devoted to
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.460]   this season of my life and chasing after the Lord. And yet for whatever reason, God just set this
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.860]   dude in my life. And now we're dating despite the fact that you have been doing all the same
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.660]   things and you want so badly to be in a relationship as well. Others of you, you know that group went
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.980]   and they had an amazing weekend together because you weren't with them. You were sitting at home
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:13.420]   and you saw it on Instagram. Others of you have tried so hard to get recognition for your good
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.140]   works, whether it's at the office or it's amongst your family or it's amongst your peers. And yet
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.340]   no one recognizes you despite you work so hard. They recognize other people.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:29.420]   Like, can we just level with ourselves for a second and acknowledge the fact
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:38.620]   that comparison is a problem? Like what it does is it causes us to look at the success of someone
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:44.060]   else and measure ourselves against it. And in the process of measuring ourselves against it,
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:53.740]   what we often find is we're embroiled with our failure. We see a deep sense of inadequacy.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:00.380]   So we find that we're angry or we're anxious or we're self-loathing or we have a lowered
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:07.020]   self-esteem. We become jealous. We're bitter. We're insecure. We have a sense of hate for someone else.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:13.740]   Comparison is a dangerous thing. There's no question about it. And there's no question
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.500]   that we're all engaging with it. It's a part of the regular human experience.
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:28.060]   So what do we do with it? Like if we're going to come in contact with it, and not even just tomorrow,
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:36.780]   but before the night's over, what do we do with it? How do we navigate the waters of comparison
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:42.300]   in a way that is riddled with wisdom and is informed by the word? That's what I want to
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.820]   do with us tonight. That's what I want to walk us through over the course of our evening together.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:52.060]   I want to show you how you can overcome comparison in your life. And the place that we're going to do
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.620]   it is we're going to do it in the gospel of John. So if you have a Bible, you can grab it.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:04.300]   John chapter 21 is where we're going to be. That's the very last chapter in the gospel of John. We've
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.140]   been working through the relationship series here at The Porch. And what we've been doing over the
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.420]   course of this series is that we've been looking at different relational categories. We've been
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.700]   looking at dating and marriage and friendship and working relationships and estranged relationships.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.940]   We've been looking at all manner of different relationships we find in our life. And yet this
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.340]   evening we decided that we didn't just want to look at a relational category. We wanted to look
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:32.140]   at a way in which we often relate to each other. And in comparison, it really is universal. Like
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.660]   it makes its way into every single category that we have talked about throughout this series.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:44.060]   And the reason we're in John chapter 21 is we see a story of comparison where Jesus interacts with
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:50.540]   a guy that really should know better. You see, what we find in chapter 21 of John's gospel is
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:56.860]   that Jesus has died for the sins of the world and he's risen from the grave. And he's in that
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.620]   intermittent period before he ascends to the right hand of the father, where he's sort of
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.660]   working a 40-day masterclass with the disciples. He's showing them, "Hey boys, this is how we're
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.100]   going to save the world. Here's your mission. Get up there and do it." He's working them through
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.420]   this 40-day class. And what he's doing is he's engaging specifically in our story tonight with
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:19.340]   a guy by the name of Peter. By the time we come to the story we see with Peter, Peter has already
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.940]   been restored into right relationship with Jesus. If you don't know Peter's story, he was one of
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:31.020]   Jesus's inner three, one of his best friends, one of his guys. And yet when the going got tough,
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:36.780]   Peter got going. He denied Jesus three times at the point of his arrest. He said he had nothing
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:42.220]   to do with the man and then he rebelled. And he was ostracized from the disciples. And yet Jesus
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:48.300]   comes to him in chapter 21 and he restores him to relationship. Peter wasn't just riding the bench,
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.460]   he was off the team. And yet Jesus comes to him and says, "Hey man, I've got your uniform,
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.780]   it's clean press, it's ready for you. Got a new role, got a new mission. Let's get back in the
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.420]   game together." And so that's where we find ourselves here in our story. And this is just
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:10.540]   an aside, but what you need to know is Peter in this moment has just received a massive dispensing
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:17.420]   of God's grace in his life. And what it's done for him is it's brought him closer to God than he was
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.380]   before. You see, your failures will bring you closer to Jesus than your successes ever will.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:28.780]   And some of you just need to know that. That's not even a part of the lesson. That's for free.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:37.580]   And yet it's important to know that Peter has just received so much grace as we come to verse 18.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:47.740]   It says this, "Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.820]   walk wherever you wanted. But when you're old, you will stretch out your hands and another will
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:12:00.060]   dress you and carry you where you do not want to go. This he said to show by what kind of death
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:05.820]   he," talking about Peter, "was to glorify God. And after saying this, he said to him, 'Follow me.'
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:11.500]   Peter turned and he saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following him, the one who had also leaned
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.940]   back against him during the supper and had said, 'Lord, who is it that's going to betray you?'
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:22.220]   That disciple's name is John. When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, 'Lord, what about this guy?
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.100]   What about this man?' And then Jesus said to him, 'If it's my will that he remain until I come,
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:35.260]   what is that to you? You follow me.'" You see, Jesus has just reinstated Peter. He's confirmed
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.860]   his life's purpose. He's reminded him, "Hey man, you're not only going to be a part of the church,
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.900]   you're going to be a massive player in leading the church." And then he takes a hard left into
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:50.780]   prophesying his martyrdom and telling him, "Hey man, you're going to die," which is probably not
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:55.820]   great conversational etiquette. And yet Jesus just wants to level with him. He wants to tell him,
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.580]   "Hey, you're going to die." But he not only tells him that he's going to die, he tells him how he's
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.860]   going to die. And it's not purposeless. Like we may read that and think, "Golly, man, did Jesus
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:10.940]   have no social tact, no awareness whatsoever?" I promise he did because he has a purpose in
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:17.820]   speaking to Peter about his own crucifixion. He's prophesying, "Hey, you're going to one day stretch
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.420]   out your arms and they will clothe you themselves. They will lead you where you do not want to go.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:29.100]   You will be crucified as I myself have been crucified." And Jesus called the shot. In AD 64,
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.700]   Peter was crucified. History shows that he was crucified upside down because he didn't think
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:40.700]   himself worthy to be crucified in the same manner as his king. And yet what we find in this story
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.900]   is it rattles Peter a little bit, as it would any of us. You learn that you're going to die
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:51.820]   and it's going to be painful. It would probably induce some fear. It would probably lead you to
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:57.900]   worry and wonder, "God, what are you doing in my life? I just got reconciled with you. We're on a
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.020]   good page together again. What are you saying that I'm going to go to my death?" And yet Jesus has
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:09.500]   purpose in it because he wants Peter to know, "Hey, I am calling you to something amazing.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.340]   I've got great purpose for your life. Great purpose, it requires great faith.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:25.020]   But before you can be filled with great faith, I need to empty you of your fear first."
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:33.500]   That's why he evokes his fear. This is what Jesus will do. He will point out the things in our
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:40.300]   lives which we fear because he knows comparison feeds on fear. Comparison feeds on fear, which is
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:47.420]   our first point. It's unique that way because in every other area of life, we run from what we fear.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:56.060]   But when it comes to comparison, we run to what we fear. Think about it like this. If you fear
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.660]   you're not skinny enough, then you need to watch what you eat. If you fear you're not successful
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.780]   enough, then you need to work harder. If you fear that you're not dateable enough, then you need to
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.980]   lower your standards. If you fear you're not pretty enough, then maybe you need to show some skin. Do
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:14.780]   you see it? When it comes to comparison, we follow what we fear, which is why it's anything but
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:20.140]   coincidental that right here in the face of Peter's fear, Jesus tells him, "Hey, don't follow
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:28.780]   your fear. You follow me. You come with me. You don't focus on that. I know that that's scary.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:34.860]   I know that causes you concern. Don't focus on that. You focus on me. Keep your eyes right here.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:40.300]   You follow after me, Peter, because the one you're focusing on is the one that you're going to follow
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:46.540]   after." I remember growing up, my family, we would go snow skiing. Anybody snow skiing here?
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.180]   We would go snow skiing, and we would always play follow the leader. It's been fun. My nieces and
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.780]   nephews are growing up now, and we take them out there, and we do the same thing. And the object
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:16:00.860]   of the game was whoever's in the lead, you follow them, as the name implies, follow the leader.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:06.940]   And you do whatever they do. If they make a turn, you make a turn. If they move through trees,
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.420]   you move with them. If they decide to ski backwards, then you better turn around and
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:17.180]   ski backwards as well. If they're pulling 360s, you need to spend some 360s yourself. You follow
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:24.940]   them however and wherever they go, because that's how you win. Like the secret to winning follow the
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:31.820]   leader is you keep your eyes dead set on the leader in front of you, and you faithfully follow them
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:38.460]   wherever they lead. We're supposed to do the same thing with Jesus. The words "follow me," if you
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.900]   read through the gospels, they appear 13 different times. And every time someone hears the words
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:52.300]   "follow me," there's a common theme associated to that command. You're going to have an immediate
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:59.340]   detachment from self-interest. Like you're going to set aside your self-interest in pursuit of
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.260]   something different. People gave up their livelihood, they left their homes, they quit
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:09.500]   their jobs, they abandoned all comfort to follow Jesus, which sounds really crazy. Amen? Like can
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.420]   any of us agree with that? Like golly, I don't know that any invitation in life is going to be
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.540]   worthy of that, of me abandoning everything I've worked hard for, of all the family that I dearly
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.340]   love, of all the comfort that I so enjoy to have. Like I don't know that anything is going to be
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:29.820]   worth giving up. And yet what you see, and this is what's crazy, when you follow Jesus,
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:37.020]   the reward of gaining him is far greater than anything you give up.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:46.620]   And so Jesus is calling Peter, "Hey, I'm going to give you so much more than you will ever be
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.380]   able to gain on your own, but it's going to require you to follow after me. You're going
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:56.620]   to have to detach yourself from some things you care about." Jesus says the same idea in Matthew
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:02.940]   16. He says, "Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.020]   and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:12.860]   loses his life for my sake will find it.'" What's comparison say instead? If the voice of truth is
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.420]   saying, "Hey, if you lose your life, you'll find it," comparison's voice is going to say instead,
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:23.580]   "Hey, you're actually losing life. So you don't need to give more life away. You need to get out
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.700]   there and find some life. Like you need to hustle after it. You're getting left behind. You better
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:33.660]   rise and grind, baby. Like you better get to work because you have some deficiencies in your life
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.140]   and you're the one that's going to have to make up the difference." This is what comparison would
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.460]   say to you. Like you need to accumulate some followers on Instagram. You need to get some
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:47.500]   more matches on Hinge. You need to get some more travel scheduled on the calendar. You need to get
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.460]   another promotion at work. You need to, whatever it is, you need to accumulate for yourself because
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:59.580]   you're deficient as you are. You're not enough as is. And so I guess we better find a way to make
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:05.180]   you into that much more of what you think you need to be. That's what comparison would say.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:12.700]   And yet what's crazy about comparison is yes, it's a fear-based response, but it's a really bad
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:19.340]   fear-based response. Like a good fear-based response leads you away from danger, but that's
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:25.820]   not what comparison does. Comparison doesn't lead you away from danger. It puts you in danger. It's
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:33.100]   really bad advice. It's like me saying, "There are few vitamins in cookies, and therefore you should
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:41.340]   eat many of them." That's horrible advice. Like I'm promising you a path to hell, and yet what's
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:48.300]   going to happen is unhealth. That's how this works. That's what comparison's promise looks like.
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:57.180]   So what do we do when comparison comes creeping? We follow Jesus. It's that simple. We follow him.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.900]   Like we identify where we feel secure, and rather than make up the difference on our own,
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:10.140]   we look at the one who made up the difference on his own. That's what we do. We follow that man.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.660]   We don't follow after any other. We stop being fearful. We start being faithful. Faithful with
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:22.060]   where God has me. Faithful with what God's calling me to do. Faithful to speak what God's asking me
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:27.980]   to say. Faithful to do whatever it is he wants me to do with my life. Because if my life
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.780]   is hidden with Christ, then my life is no longer my own. It's Christ that lives in me.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:38.620]   He gets to do with me what he wants. He gets to lead me where he wishes. I will be faithful to
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:44.380]   follow that man. You see, we have to make sure we're following the right person. So porch,
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:51.500]   who are you following right now? Who are you following? And here's the thing, like I felt this
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:57.340]   as I was preparing to teach this message. There's nothing about comparison I can tell you that you
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:04.540]   may not already well know. Like this is an old idea. Sure, I want to present it in a new way,
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:11.020]   and yet my goal is just to take this concept of comparison, put it back on the table for us to
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:17.020]   consider and call you to take responsibility where it has run amok in your life. That's what I want
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:22.220]   to do tonight. That's what I'm striving after. And so if you're following after the wrong person,
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:28.220]   then the responsibility is yours to change what's in your power to change.
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:33.420]   So what does that look like? Well, for some of you, it means you need to go into your
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:38.540]   social media and you actually need to consider who is it that I'm following. And let me remove
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.020]   anyone that I'm following that I don't meaningfully interact with on a regular basis,
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:48.540]   because I'm not following them because they're a friend. I'm following them because they're a goal.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:55.500]   And my goal is the upper call of Christ. Let me get rid of that. For others of us, it means
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.060]   slashing our shopping budget in half, and we need to quit liking to know it.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.780]   And we just need to choose instead, like to know him.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:13.100]   Others of us, we need to really ask the question as we consider the photos we post on Instagram,
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:20.540]   like, man, why am I posting whatever I'm posting? Because you know, you don't need to
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.220]   coincidentally place your engagement ring in every single photo.
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:30.780]   Like you don't need to carefully craft your picture so that that name brand is included,
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.500]   is included so everybody else can see you can't actually associate with that sort of wealth.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:44.860]   Some of us, it's not social media or public perception at all. It's private perception.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.980]   Like rather than worrying about the real that's going across your social media,
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.220]   you need to think about the real that's playing through your mind. And you need to consider the
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.620]   fact that the conversation you had with that person, you don't need to keep replaying it over
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:04.060]   and over and over again. Like you can let those things go, you can move on, even though you think
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.140]   that you said something stupid or you sounded really dumb or you wish you could take that thing
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.740]   back because now what are they going to think of me? Like I'm never going to be able to associate
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:17.900]   with those specific people. And some of us here, we're long-time believers.
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:23.660]   And the topic of comparison comes up and we think we're good, man. Like I already followed Jesus,
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.500]   that command, I'm already registering with that. If you're here and you think you're safe from
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:33.020]   comparison because you already follow Jesus, let me just level with you. If Peter's not safe,
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:40.460]   you're not safe either. We see it as we keep going. It says in verse 20, "Peter turned and he
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.620]   saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following him, the one whom had also leaned back against him
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:49.180]   during the supper. And it said, 'Lord, who is it that's going to betray you?' And when Peter saw
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:57.580]   him, he said to Jesus, 'Lord, what about this man?'" Not even one verse after Jesus looks at Peter
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:02.140]   and is like, "Hey, follow me." Peter's like, "But what about that guy?" Like we're not even a verse
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:08.860]   away. And if you know Peter at all, this is true to form. This is so on brand. Like he turns around
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:14.780]   and what it means is he turns around is that his eyes stop focusing on following Jesus and they
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:22.060]   start focusing on following someone else. And it sets him up for a world of hurt. It puts him in
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.700]   a position where he's less interested in what Jesus is calling him to do. And he's more interested in
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:33.180]   what Jesus is calling John to do. And it jeopardizes their friendship. Because here's the
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:39.580]   second point. Comparison, it turns friends into rivals. Comparison turns friends into rivals.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.660]   Like these two guys, they're good friends. I already said they were part of Jesus's inner
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:49.820]   circle and they had some really meaningful moments in life together. Like if you track what Peter and
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.700]   John, the two of them are explicitly a part of, what you see is these are the guys that, I mean,
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:00.380]   they fished together and then they got called into Jesus's ministry together. And then they saw
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:06.860]   Jesus, the man, become Jesus, the son of God, as he transfigured before them. And then they made
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:12.460]   their way to the garden of Gethsemane and they prayed with Jesus. But that happened after they
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.860]   had actually gone together to prepare the Passover feast that they would share with Jesus. And then
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:23.180]   after Jesus died and he rose, they raced each other to the tomb. And then we find them here
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:28.460]   in this moment right now, where they're engaging with the resurrected Lord. And if you keep tracking
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:32.060]   their story, they have more moments like this. Like it just keeps going on and on and on and on.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.060]   Like this is the stuff that friendships are made of. They're part of God's work in the world.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.820]   They're making a difference alongside each other. And yet in the face of comparison,
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:45.980]   all of it is jeopardized. All of it is risked in a moment.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.340]   And comparison stands to do the same thing to you and your friends.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:26:00.140]   Like it is laughable how quick in this story, Peter goes from following Jesus to following
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.620]   someone else. And yet this happens to us too. Like rather than following God's plan for our own lives,
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.260]   we start following God's plan for other people's lives. Like if you've ever been a social media
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:15.180]   sleuth, you know, you know somebody is dating that guy or that girl, or they're actually associated
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.460]   with that specific person that man, he would love to be associated with that person. They're so
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.980]   famous. They're so popular. They've got so much influence. How did they get connected to that
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.140]   person? Or you actually saw that person was involved with that group of people. And did you
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.540]   see the concert that they went to? That was amazing. Or man, they took that trip all together. God,
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:35.740]   that was awesome. If you've ever been that person and you were able to social media stalk your way
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:40.860]   into someone else's life, you have just proven my point that you are far more interested in living
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:46.860]   someone else's life than living the life that God has given you. We are all prone to this,
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:53.740]   especially in our digital age. We're so much more interested oftentimes in what God is doing
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:27:00.300]   somewhere else than what he is doing right here at hand. Why? Why is that the case? Well,
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:06.060]   according to psychology and the social comparison theory, it's one of two reasons. Very simply,
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.980]   we compare ourselves either because we want to feel better about ourselves or because we want
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:15.900]   to motivate ourselves to improve. Which if I could just boil that down for you, it just simply means
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:22.860]   that we look at other people's lives because we're not happy with our own. Like all comparison
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:29.900]   with others is rooted in a discontentment with myself. That's where comparison comes from.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:40.380]   Like you don't actually care if that guy gets the job. You just care that you didn't get the job.
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:48.140]   You actually don't care that she looks the way she does. You just care that you don't look
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:53.500]   the way that she does. You actually don't care that they took that trip. You just care that
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:58.540]   you didn't get to take that trip. And so here's the thing, Porch, lean in with me on this.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:05.980]   Your issue is not with them. Your issue is with him. And so if you have a complaint,
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.060]   you need to take it with the big guy. You've got to process it with God Almighty
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:18.860]   because your life is your life because it's the life he wants you to live.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:29.900]   But here's the danger of comparison. If we don't take it up with him, if we don't deal with God,
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:36.460]   then we will deal with others. And we will take the friends in our lives and we will turn them
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:45.500]   into rivals. That's why James says this in chapter four. He says, "You desire and you do not have.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:53.420]   So what do you do? You murder. You covet. You can't obtain. So you fight and you quarrel.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.820]   You do not have because you do not ask." I love that he puts it on the end. It just feels like
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:03.660]   a weird, like inclusion to the back end of that verse. Like you do not have because you do not
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.220]   ask. What's he saying? He's like, "Hey, all the fighting, all the quarreling, all the anger and
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.900]   frustration you feel towards each other, all of that is the product of you not talking to him
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.940]   about it." That's where it comes from. You're talking amongst yourselves when in reality,
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.260]   you should be talking to him. You don't have because you don't ask because you haven't gotten
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:26.860]   honest with the Lord. Like it's alarming. Like we will fight others and tear them down just because
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:32.540]   we don't have what they do. Like that's the nature of coveting. What's coveting? Coveting
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.500]   is a fully grown comparison. That's what comparison grows up to when it gets big, kids.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:44.700]   It turns into coveting. And what happens in a coveting type of relationship is I not only want
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:52.540]   what you have, I resent you for having it. I hate you for having it. And we see this everywhere.
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:59.100]   God, just look at the news right now. Like political candidates taking cheap shots and
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:06.700]   low blows. Scroll through Twitter and you'll see athletes ripping each other apart. You can go and
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:12.300]   you can read the comment section. You'll find trolls around everywhere. We become a hater,
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:19.340]   which by definition, according to hip hop historians, is actually ascribed to someone
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:25.420]   that's jealous of someone else. That's what it means. Comparison turns friends into rivals.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:32.460]   It's turning Peter against John. And it's more than likely turn some of you against your own.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:40.540]   So what do we do when that happens? Well, think about the instructions that Jesus gives Peter
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.740]   right before we get to this section. Again, we didn't read it, but he looks at him and as he's
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:49.740]   restoring him, he says, "Hey, do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me?" Asks him three times.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:55.900]   And every time he asks, Peter says, "You know that I do." And Jesus' response is, "Then feed my sheep.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:03.020]   Do you love me? Then feed my sheep." What does that mean? Love my people, serve my people,
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:09.820]   help my people. Like it's odd for a shepherd to see a sheep that's struggling and choose
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:17.820]   to revel in their misery. That's a weird thing. Or it's strange for a shepherd to see a sheep
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:24.140]   thriving and hate them for the green grass they eat off of. That is odd. That doesn't make any
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:29.820]   sense. And to the watching world, it is odd when the people of God that claim to love their Lord
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:38.940]   do not love one another. It's strange. It's weird. It's odd because it's not what we've been called
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:46.140]   to. We're supposed to love one another. Romans 12 says it like this, "Rejoice with those who rejoice
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:51.100]   and weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Don't be haughty, but associate
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:55.820]   with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:01.980]   do what is honorable in the sight of all." Do what's honorable. Like that's the mark of a true
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:09.980]   Christian. You do what's honorable. So when someone actually achieves something significant,
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:19.180]   it is not honorable to hate them for their achievement, to wish ill behind their back
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:24.700]   because they actually found themselves in some sort of favor that they may not have sought after
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:30.620]   on their own. Like it's odd. That's not honorable. That's jealous. Like if you get upset because
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:36.140]   someone gets ahead, that's not honorable either. That's jealousy. If you delight in the misfortune
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:40.300]   of someone else, that's not honorable. That's jealousy. And it looks weird on God's people.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:47.020]   We are called to celebrate with those who celebrate. We rejoice with those who rejoice. We
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:52.140]   hurt with those who hurt. We weep with those who weep. That is our response to one another. We
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:59.180]   serve each other like that. I remember my sophomore year, I just made the conscious decision. It was
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:06.300]   a defining moment where I made the call that I was going to be less worried about whether or not
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:11.260]   people loved me. And I was going to be far more concerned whether or not I loved them.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:18.460]   And you know what happened? Things started changing for me. Like my confidence grew.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:24.940]   My friends started to increase. I started to get access into things that I had not had access into
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:31.580]   before. I started to have fun that I wasn't a part of previously. Like I started to find myself
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:37.980]   enjoying the kind of life that I wished I had enjoyed before. Why? Was it because I gained the
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.700]   system? I know how this works. I need to give them a little bit so they'll give me a little bit back.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:51.100]   Quid pro quo. This for that. No, that's not what I was doing. I just started caring for people.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:57.100]   And listen, this is not an example of my perfection. Follow me as I follow. That's
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:02.220]   not what I'm doing. But I am just telling you, as your care for others goes up,
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:10.140]   your comparison to others will go down. If you start thinking about how you can serve others,
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:16.300]   you'll stop worrying about whether or not you're getting served. You start worrying about whether
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:21.660]   or not others feel enjoyed, you'll stop worrying about whether or not you are enjoyable. Because
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:27.260]   you feed sheep, just as Jesus commanded Peter. Loving others, it liberates us from comparing
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:33.660]   to others. It saves our friends from becoming our rivals. But that's not all. Our third point is in
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.940]   these final few verses. Look at 21 with me. When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, "Lord, what about
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:45.100]   this man?" And Jesus said to him, "If it's my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:52.140]   You follow me." So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die,
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:56.860]   yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die. But if it's my will that he remain until I
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.380]   come, what is that to you? Third and final point that we need to learn if we're going to overcome
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:05.500]   comparison is we need to know that comparison will rob you of joy. Comparison will rob you of joy,
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:12.380]   which you've heard before. You're a smart bunch. You know comparison is the thief of all joy.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:16.540]   And the reality is the Bible would agree with that sentiment. While it's subtle in this text,
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:21.340]   it's nonetheless true that so long as Peter is trapped in comparison, he will never experience
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:28.060]   the kind of joy he longs for. Why is that? Because joy is found in one place and one place alone,
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.780]   and that is with the person of Jesus. If I am following after someone else,
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:39.500]   then I am no longer following after Christ, which means I'm no longer following after my joy. I will
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:48.540]   not find joy anywhere else. You know this. Look at your own life. If you trace those behaviors
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:55.180]   where you seem to find some sense of sensory satisfaction and momentary pleasure and delight,
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:36:01.340]   it always fades. It always abates, and you always have to return. You know it to be true.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:07.100]   But with Christ, that's not the case. And so Jesus is looking at Peter, and he's like,
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:13.180]   "Don't worry about him. Follow me." It's easy to read this and to think, "Man,
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.460]   Jesus is pretty irritated." That's how I read it. Did you all read it that way? Like, "Man,
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.500]   Jesus is really annoyed with Peter. He's the kid that won't take out the trash, and he has to be
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.540]   told over and over and over again." How many times do I have to tell you, Peter? Come on, man.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.780]   Get on board with what I'm trying to do here. And listen, I don't know if Jesus is irritated or
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:32.460]   isn't irritated, but what I do know is Jesus is full of compassion. And that's what we should
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:39.660]   read into this text. Because as he looks at Peter, he says, "Hey, why are you worried about my plans
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:46.620]   for his life? I've got plans for yours. Why are you worried about what I'm doing with John? I'm
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.580]   going to do something with you. Don't worry about my purposes for him, Peter. I've got purposes for
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:56.460]   your life. I'm doing something significant. I want to take you somewhere special. I'm going to make
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:04.700]   something great of my glory through your life. Trust me. Walk with me. Follow me." And he's saying
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:12.300]   the same thing to some of us here. Some of us are so ensnared to comparison, and yet where comparison's
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:18.140]   voice wants to lead you astray, compassion's voice is saying, "Come here where joy and delight and
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:25.660]   fullness of life is found. It's with me. So walk with me." Jesus doesn't want Peter to be so
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:30.940]   mesmerized with John's life that he misses his own, and he doesn't want us to miss ours either.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:37.580]   Because here's the crazy thing about comparison. When we're comparing ourself to someone else,
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:43.100]   when we're observing their life, yes, we are not truly able to live our own, but where we
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:49.740]   wish to have what they have, we miss what God has already given. And I promise the gifts of God in
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:57.420]   your life, they're better than you think. They're deeper than you've already delved to find. They're
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:05.820]   richer than you dare dream they may be. He's that good. He really truly is. Call his bluff and see
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:12.460]   if he won't surprise you. He's telling you, "Come with me. I'm where joy is found." Think about the
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:20.460]   greatest showman. The entire movie is about what? It's about the pursuit of one P.T. Barnum that
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:25.500]   desperately wants to be associated with a people that he is not naturally associated with. He wants
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:30.380]   to be a part of the upper class, like the ruling elite, the socialites. I want to be up there. And
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:38.940]   so what does he do? He lives his entire life to get to that end. And what you find, spoiler alert,
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:48.220]   is he achieves that end and there's no joy there. None. He loses all joy. This guy was bursting with
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:56.140]   life. And then you see he finds himself in the halls of power and he's miserable. His family's
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:01.340]   disheveled. His life is falling apart because he wasn't living the life God gave him. He was living
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:08.460]   someone else's life. And what you find at the end of the movie is after he hits rock bottom and
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:15.420]   everything is stripped away from him, the people that God had given him originally were still there
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:21.260]   with him. And his joy returned because he was back to living the way God wanted him to be.
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:27.340]   This is the invitation on the table for you. Don't fall prey to comparison.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:35.180]   Instead, walk with Jesus. You see, to be ensnared by comparison is to be enslaved to dissatisfaction.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.700]   Like comparison is always discouraging because someone inevitably ends up on
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:45.660]   bottom. But when we stop focusing on what we don't have and we start focusing on what we do have,
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:52.620]   namely that we have Jesus, we find all the joy we've been looking for. Psalm 1611 says,
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.540]   "You make known to me the path of life in your presence, God, there's fullness of joy
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.820]   at your right hand where Christ Jesus sits our pleasures forevermore." Psalm 107.9, "For he
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:09.580]   satisfies the longing soul." Do you have a longing soul? He'll satisfy it. "The hungry soul he fills
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:16.140]   with good things." Psalm 63, 5-6, "My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:21.420]   will praise you with joyful lips when I remember you upon my bed and meditate on you in the watches
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:27.180]   of the night." Friends, we have every reason to be grateful because this is true. And listen to me,
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.940]   I know that some of you are here tonight and you're desperately trying to hold fast to this truth.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:39.020]   You know, my response as I walk with God is I should be grateful.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:47.820]   But it's so hard given what I have. It feels like I'm so unseen, I'm so unheard, I feel lost and
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:57.180]   alone. And so I know I'm supposed to be grateful. I should rejoice. And yet knowing full well that's
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:03.500]   what I should be, I feel like a fraud. I feel like a fake. I feel like a hypocrite. Can I just
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:08.300]   encourage you if that's you here in the room, gratitude is a state of being more than a state
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:14.700]   of feeling. It's a state of being more than a state of feeling. If you are in Christ Jesus,
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:21.580]   then your being, the very essence of your identity is put you in a position where gratitude is
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:27.820]   possible. And I'll level with the rest of you, if you don't know him, then your state of being is
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:35.900]   one where gratitude is impossible. True gratitude, unfettered joy, it's found nowhere else but in
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:46.220]   this man. Friends, when we read words like this from Jesus as less harsh and more compassionate,
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:52.140]   we can feel that same voice speaking to us tonight. Like what's it to you if he has more
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:59.100]   favor with your boss than you? Like what's it to you if she has the kind of life you've always
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:04.220]   wished for? What's it to you if they are in a loving dating relationship and you can't seem
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.460]   to find someone? What's it to you if they're more popular even though they're less godly?
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:19.660]   What's it to you? You follow me. I'm the satisfier of life. I'm the giver of full joy.
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:29.020]   I'm the one that will leave you wanting nevermore. You follow me, trust me, walk with me,
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:35.260]   and see the kind of joy, the fullness of life I will give you. Because comparison will rob you of
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:42.220]   joy, but my compassion, it stands ready to offer it without end. How do we know that this is all true?
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:50.380]   Because Jesus Christ has proven this is the case. Like where comparison feeds on fear,
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:57.420]   Christ's compassion has freed us from fear. When we were the enemies of God, all of us lost and
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:05.100]   gone astray in our sin, dejected from his presence and separated forevermore, Jesus said that is not
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:12.060]   satisfactory for me. I will do whatever it takes to get you back, to pull you close, to be reunited
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:18.460]   in right relationship with you, and so I will step in and where comparison would lead you off in fear,
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:26.220]   I will lead myself to you and bring you back to me where I am. Where comparison turns friends
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:33.420]   into rivals. Christ's compassion has turned rivals into friends. He's taken those that hated God and
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:40.620]   he has brought them in and made them lovers of God. He has taken the lonely and the lost and he's made
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:45.260]   them sons and he's made them daughters for those that see his life and see he is born the full
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:50.940]   consequence of my sin. He rose from the dead so that I might have life and life forevermore should
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:57.740]   I place my faith in him. And where comparison robs you of joy, tonight friends, Christ's compassion
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:02.860]   stands ready to offer it to you forevermore. Do you want joy? Then don't look anywhere else.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:10.700]   Look to him because he's been looking for you for so long. Let me pray for us. God we love you.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:20.380]   Thankful God for an evening to sit in your word. So grateful God that there's not a single soul
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:33.100]   here tonight that is too far gone, that has done too much wrong, that is filled with deficiencies
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:41.900]   you God cannot fill through your son. I pray Lord, like I want my friends to experience the kind of
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:48.460]   joy I know you give. Not just because I can reason with it theologically or I can point
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:53.260]   to it experientially but God I have felt it personally.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:45:02.860]   Please Lord for those here that feel insufficient, inadequate, not enough as they already are,
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:09.660]   would they look to Jesus and see one that says you're exactly as I want you.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:14.460]   The good, the bad, and the ugly, the most cringe-worthy parts of yourself,
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:19.340]   they could not keep me from you and they will not keep me from you now.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:24.860]   We love you God. It's in Christ Jesus name we pray. Amen.
