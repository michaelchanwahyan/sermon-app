[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:23.520]   - So awesome to worship with you guys.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.520]   And I know Fort Worth, you just finished singing praises
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.920]   to God in Houston and wherever you're at,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.500]   I pray that you would just start this message
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.660]   before we dive in, acknowledging God and His sovereignty,
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.220]   a creator of the heavens, the earth,
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.540]   and just that He's a good God
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.520]   and He's involved and active in our lives.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.700]   And it's fun to sing of His praises with you.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.820]   And it is a great honor to do so.
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.280]   Great to be with you tonight.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.980]   If you would turn in your Bibles,
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.980]   if you brought them to 1 Samuel 17, 1 Samuel 17,
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.500]   we're talking about the man after God's own heart tonight,
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.460]   David, David was a shepherd, David was a king,
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.980]   shepherd turned king, and David fought Goliath
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.500]   here in chapter 17.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.980]   And so if we're going to talk about David and Goliath,
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.500]   what more appropriate than to start with a fighting story?
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.960]   And unfortunately, I have a few to choose from,
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.060]   but I'll start with the kind of first fight
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.740]   I had ever gotten in or been in.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.620]   And it started at Red Lobster, okay?
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.320]   This guy had been talking trash about me behind my back
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.260]   and I had caught word and me and my boys
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.940]   were at Red Lobster and he was there
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.900]   with his grandparents, right?
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.620]   And who's gonna fight in front of their grandparents?
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.660]   And so I walk up to him and I did what any coward would do.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.660]   And I pushed him against the walls
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.420]   like in front of his grandma, man.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.060]   I mean, what is wrong with me?
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.140]   And don't let the pink shirt fool you, man, I'm thug.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.060]   And so I'm just like, hey, you got something to say?
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.380]   And he's just kind of like looking at his grandma
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.420]   and then he gets in the car.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.100]   I'm like, that's what I thought, you know?
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.300]   And that was that.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.620]   And so then he went to a different school than me.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.140]   And so I'm at a basketball game at his school, okay?
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.380]   I'm on his turf, his territory.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.660]   And this is after the little Red Lobster skirmish.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.100]   He, at halftime of this basketball game,
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.740]   he walks out to center court right there in the circle
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.700]   and he calls me out of the stands
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.140]   and he looks at me and he's like, you know,
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.180]   and I'm like, oh man, I think he's upset.
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.140]   And so after the game, you know, he comes up
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.740]   and he's got a few things to say
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.140]   and I'm like, okay, it's gonna go down, you know?
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.940]   And that's cool because I had taken Taekwondo.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.380]   I was like at least a yellow belt and stuff.
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.420]   And so it was like the scene in a movie.
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.220]   It was nighttime, we go in the back,
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.300]   we're on the blacktop, the asphalt,
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.180]   and there's hundreds of people around
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.340]   from his school, of course,
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.740]   and so they're chanting his name, I'm like, okay.
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.980]   And I'm thinking like, just truth be told,
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.180]   I'm thinking, I'm gonna kill this kid, okay?
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.260]   'Cause he's a little guy, he was short,
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.900]   I'm six foot seven, you know,
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.060]   I was this height in high school,
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.100]   and I'm like, I'm gonna kill this kid.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.340]   I'm like, where are you at, you know?
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.900]   About to Daniel LaRusso this guy.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.260]   And so anyways, he, you know, the crowds part
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.220]   and he comes forward and I'm just like, I'm ready, you know?
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.260]   And he kind of feints back like he's gonna punch me
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.780]   and then he goes to wraps me up
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.820]   and I'm just cocky, I'm just like,
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.580]   I had slipped off my Doc Martin sandals,
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.140]   I'm ready to do work.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.540]   And I just remember saying this in his ear,
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.300]   I'm like, dude, you're not gonna slam me, you know?
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.260]   And then right about then he slammed me.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.260]   And he just started, boom, unloading on my face.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.620]   And it dawned on me, oh, we're really gonna fight.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.180]   Up until now, I was like, we just wrestle, you know,
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.020]   it was all fun and games.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.500]   I didn't know this was really gonna go down like this.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.180]   And so I'm staring at the street light,
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.500]   the street light's like flashing like a camera flash
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.660]   every time I get punched by his fist.
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.780]   And it was terrible.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.780]   It was like, I got slaughtered by this dude.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.100]   Like just completely annihilated.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.620]   I was so humbled by this guy.
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.020]   It was the worst, it was such a terrible day.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.120]   And you know, and it just not how I thought
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.680]   it was gonna go, you know?
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.300]   I thought it was gonna go different than that.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.820]   And as I think about that experience,
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.100]   I had trusted in all the wrong things.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.400]   Like I had trusted in my strength,
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.820]   I had trusted in my stature, my size, my height.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.820]   And I had placed my faith in the wrong things
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.080]   and it failed me.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.780]   And anytime you place your faith in you,
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.160]   it's not going to go well, well for you.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   And I'm not saying that if I would have only,
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.640]   you know, stepped up to the, you know,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.960]   the ring trusting in God, that would have went a lot better.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.320]   No, had I trusted in God,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.420]   I would have never been in that situation.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.120]   Had I placed my faith in God,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.760]   I wouldn't have been in the situation to begin with.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.680]   But because I had placed my faith in myself
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.920]   and it manifested in this gross arrogance,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.360]   it didn't go well for me.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.760]   In fact, it humbled me.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.900]   And as I think about Christianity today,
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.000]   I think so many of us walk around
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.120]   throwing around this word faith,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.380]   like we have it in God
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.240]   and really we just have it in ourselves.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.800]   Like God, we trust you and really we trust our jobs,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.400]   we trust our money, we trust our savings,
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.560]   we trust our relationships,
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.360]   we trust our strengths and our abilities.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.520]   And really what we pray for are things
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.380]   that would allow us not to trust you.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.320]   God, give me comforts.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.180]   Give me the easy life.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.360]   Give me everything I want
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.480]   so that I wouldn't need to trust you,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.840]   I wouldn't need faith in you, God.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.280]   So trusting in yourself has two outcomes
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.760]   that I wanna talk with you about this evening.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.680]   One is fear and the other is false confidence.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.500]   When you trust in yourself,
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.720]   you are left with fear or false confidence.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.320]   Let me just illustrate this for a second
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.920]   and ladies, I'll rope you in
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.760]   to the old fighting illustration, if you will.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.780]   And so if you trust in your looks,
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.760]   if you feel like you're the prettiest girl,
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.180]   you're gonna have a false confidence.
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.500]   You've trusted in what is fleeting,
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.240]   you've trusted in something that's going to go away.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.980]   But when a prettier girl comes,
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.020]   then all of a sudden you become fearful,
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.640]   you feel threatened.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.300]   Okay, so it either leads to a false arrogance
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.300]   or a false confidence or it leads to fear
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.820]   because you've put your faith in the wrong thing.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.420]   And this is what I think marks American Christianity,
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.140]   us placing our faith in the wrong thing.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.260]   And so tonight we're talking about the results of faith.
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.820]   We're gonna look at the faith of Goliath,
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.180]   the faith of the Israelites
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.220]   and the faith of the man after God's own heart, David.
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.820]   To define faith, it's defined this way,
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.480]   complete trust or confidence in someone or something.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.500]   Complete trust or confidence in someone or something.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.540]   When you have that complete trust
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.100]   in the things of this world,
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.900]   if you've built it on fleeting things,
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.380]   it falls out from underneath you like a trap door.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.940]   Sooner or later it leaves you devastated,
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.360]   disappointed, discouraged, wanting.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.700]   But if you placed your faith in something constant,
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.760]   it never fails you.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.940]   It's always there for you.
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.020]   If we can learn this this evening,
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.100]   this is a life changer,
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.400]   it's a game changer for the way that you live.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.160]   And I think this story really teaches it.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.260]   And so I'm gonna give you two examples of misplaced faith
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.160]   and one of a correctly placed faith
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.200]   before you leave here this evening.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.660]   And so David and Goliath is a historical account.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.800]   It happened about 1024 BC,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.760]   so about a thousand years before Christ shows up on the scene
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.940]   it happened in a real place, the Valley of Elah.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.820]   I was just there, I drove right by this little area
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.360]   just south of Jerusalem where this fight went down.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.160]   Two hills, valley in between,
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.940]   that's where they're at right now.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.940]   David, a lot of times the storybooks
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.480]   kind of picture him as a little boy.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.740]   He wasn't a boy, he was 18, not 20,
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.920]   not old enough to fight in Saul's army yet, but a man.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.760]   So he was probably 18 or 19 years old, David, in this story.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.280]   He's the son of Jesse and we know he has brothers.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.240]   This is the real true Cinderella story.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.720]   People love this story.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.440]   The History Channel continues to retell stories
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.560]   about David and Goliath.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.020]   They talk about how his sling
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.240]   could have actually killed this man.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.480]   They've tested it.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.640]   They brought in an expert, a sling expert of today
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.800]   who tosses a rock, not a slingshot like this,
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.880]   but two straps and a place to hold the rock
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.760]   that you spin around like this and you release it.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.280]   And this is still something that some areas practice.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   They still hunt with these things evidently.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.680]   And so in chapter 16, it's this incredible picture
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.320]   where Samuel, the prophet Samuel shows up.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.420]   Saul is king, Saul looks like a king.
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.200]   Saul is what everybody thinks of when they think of a king.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.120]   And then there's this child, this new man,
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.080]   this 18 year old David who's a shepherd in the field
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.160]   and the prophet Samuel comes and anoints him as king.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.560]   He says, it's not your older brother,
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.040]   it's not your older brother, it's not your older brother,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.560]   no, it's you, David, you're gonna be king.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.320]   And what David does is an incredible act of humility.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.040]   He goes back to being a shepherd.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.460]   He tends to the sheep.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.520]   He goes to be Saul's armor bearer.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.700]   He carries the king's armor.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.360]   He plays the harp for the king.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   He's a servant to the king.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.960]   God says, you're going to be king.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.120]   He says, great, today I'll be a servant.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.680]   Would you have the courage,
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.240]   would you have the humility to do that?
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   If God shows up and says, hey, you're gonna be king,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.360]   would you be like, well, when?
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.640]   Let's get that show on the road.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.880]   Or would you be like, great,
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.440]   today I'll take the lowliest position possible
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.480]   and I'll serve people.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.800]   And so now in chapter 17, it starts like this.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.480]   I'll be in verse two.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.860]   Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.360]   in the valley of Elah and drew up their battle line
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.400]   to meet the Philistines.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.680]   The Philistines occupied one hill
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.600]   and the Israelites another
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.400]   and the valley was in between them.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.480]   So the Philistines, they're the sea people
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.360]   who occupied the land of Canaan.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   This was a land that was promised to God.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.080]   These are wicked, vile people.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.360]   They worship many gods, but their main God was named Beel
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.080]   where we get the word Beelzebub or Satan.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.280]   Okay, Satan or Beel and Asherah,
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.880]   would, they would have God sex, I guess.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.440]   Okay, and this is, they practiced this kind of gross form
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.240]   of sexuality, a grotesque form of sexuality.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.320]   It marked these people.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.360]   Think modern day Satan worshipers.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.000]   That's who the Philistines were.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.720]   Okay, they would picture Asherah
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.160]   as this kind of well-endowed naked woman
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.680]   over a bunch of bloody skulls.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.680]   It's gross, it's evil, it's wicked, it's dark.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.640]   That's who these people were.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.360]   And they had bronze.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.440]   Okay, so what that meant is basically they had
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.920]   the nuclear weapons of this time.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.680]   They had an advanced military technology
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.800]   that was not available to everyone else.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.200]   And so not only were they gross warriors,
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.320]   they were also incredible.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.640]   They had an incredible military.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.760]   That's who these people were.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:21.520]   Verse four, a champion named Goliath, who was from Gath,
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.840]   came out from the Philistine camp.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.560]   This word champion is very important.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.000]   When you see it, I want you to circle it in your text.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.800]   It comes from two Hebrew words,
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.720]   one for man and another for go between.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.120]   This word champion is for the man who goes between,
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.760]   and I'll tell you why in just a second.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.640]   His height was six cubits and a span.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.400]   That's around eight feet to nine feet, six inches.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.520]   He's a giant, okay?
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.880]   He is a literal live giant.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.400]   He made a bronze helmet on his head
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.480]   and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.360]   weighing 5,000 shekels.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.200]   On his legs, he wore bronze greaves
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.720]   and a bronze javelin was slung on his back.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.960]   His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.960]   and its iron point weighed 600 shekels or 15 pounds.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.560]   His shield bearer went ahead of him.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.680]   This dude's got somebody whose only job
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.720]   is to carry his shield so that he doesn't get hit by stuff.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.880]   Can we just agree that's the worst job in the world?
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.440]   Can you think of a worse job?
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.800]   And he failed miserably on this account.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.600]   And so, Goliath shouted.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.680]   He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel,
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.920]   "Why do you come out and line up and battle?
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.600]   "Am I not a Philistine?
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.680]   "And are you not the servants of Saul?
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.980]   "Choose a man and have him come down to me.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.500]   "If he is able to fight and kill me,
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.020]   "we will become your subjects.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.620]   "But if I overcome him and kill him,
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.280]   "you will become our subjects and serve us."
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.660]   Then the Philistine said,
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.640]   "This day I defy the armies of Israel.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.160]   "Give me a man and let us fight each other
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.960]   "that we're champion."
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.960]   It's this winner-takes-all mentality.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.040]   I will fight on behalf of my whole army.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.280]   Send a man, let's duel, and the winner takes all.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.200]   Let's go.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.640]   And he's calling them out.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.360]   This is the equivalent of your mama.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.200]   What are you gonna do about it?
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.480]   Nothing, that's what I thought.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.800]   Mic drop, get over it.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.840]   He's just talking madness to these guys.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.600]   And so my first point this evening
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.420]   is arrogance is misplaced faith.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:31.080]   Arrogance is misplaced faith.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.080]   Cockiness, confidence in yourself is misplaced faith.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.760]   See, Goliath was, he was as courageous as David.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.840]   We think, well, this story is about courageous David.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.200]   Goliath is just as courageous as David.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.080]   Maybe more courageous.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.760]   Like, he's there before David ever shows up on the scene.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.880]   He's like, "Send me any guy, your strongest guy,
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.700]   "your biggest, baddest, fastest guy.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.260]   "Send him to fight me."
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.040]   He's very courageous.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.400]   But his courage comes from the wrong place.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.760]   His courage comes from his faith and his stature,
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.040]   his faith and his strength, his faith and his possessions,
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.020]   his faith and his technology.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.880]   He's big, he's tall, he's strong.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.880]   He has 125 pounds of bronze on him, this text tells us.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.160]   The tip of his spear weighs 15 pounds, this text tells us.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.120]   He has a man who carries his shield.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.080]   Some modern commentaries would tell you
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.600]   that Goliath is an underdog.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.200]   Like, the text is trying to tell you that he's an underdog.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.600]   This text goes into great detail in the Hebrew
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.680]   to make one point to you.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.120]   Goliath is a bad warrior of a man.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.080]   He, by logical, worldly standards,
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.160]   is absolutely not the underdog.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.620]   He is the favored victor here.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.700]   That's Goliath.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:57.200]   And so his arrogance comes from trusting in his own ability.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.460]   He has a cocky courage.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.080]   Proverbs 16, 18 says that pride goes before the fall.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.800]   And the Bible goes on over and over,
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.480]   this is what I want you to hear me.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.820]   The Bible goes on to tell you over and over
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.420]   that people who trust in themselves are enemies of God.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.600]   That people who do what they want,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.040]   they live for themselves, they trust in their own abilities
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.080]   are enemies of God.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.660]   And I think for so many of us, we're like Goliath.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.300]   Like, we say we have a faith,
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.700]   but we live our lives by our own abilities,
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.900]   our own strengths, our own degree, our own relationships,
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.080]   those who we know, those are the things we worry about,
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.240]   those are the things that we obsess about.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.080]   And the Bible says, the Scripture says,
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.600]   this book teaches us that God has distributed talents to you
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.760]   not for you, but for him, so that you would plug
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.840]   into his body and those talents would come alive
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.880]   as you serve others in the name of God
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.680]   and you serve God with those talents.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.880]   That's why you were created.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.760]   If you're not doing that, you are missing out
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.760]   on your purpose of life, you are living without a purpose.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.760]   Let me say it more strong.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.480]   You are wasting your life if you are not doing that.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.160]   You are wasting your life.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.500]   And so let me ask you a question,
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.860]   what is the source of your confidence this evening?
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.080]   Is it a degree?
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.120]   Is it who you know?
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.820]   Is it a drive in you?
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.740]   Is it, it's like entrepreneurship, is it your looks?
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.660]   Is it the way you look?
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.640]   Is it your physique, the way you work out?
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.920]   Is it your income, is it your car or your possessions?
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.800]   Is this where your faith comes from?
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.220]   Is this where your confidence comes from?
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:47.140]   Is it your strength, your popularity?
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.320]   Is it your address?
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.400]   Is it your family's name?
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:57.260]   If it is anything but God, you've missed it.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.460]   Those things don't define you.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.360]   You're a child of God, the creator of the heavens
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.060]   and the earth, 100 years from now,
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.960]   that's the only thing that will matter.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.260]   And so I think we're like Goliath
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.900]   in that we seek to trust in our stature
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.640]   and our strength over our savior.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:20.440]   See, the enemies of the Christian faith,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.780]   they have to trust in their abilities.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.240]   They have nothing else to trust in.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.580]   All they're left with is their degree.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.740]   All they're left with is their education.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.200]   All they're left with is their abilities,
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.840]   that part of their resume that say skills and abilities.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.500]   That's all they got.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.640]   But you, Christian, you have something
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.800]   much greater than that, much more incredible than that.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.100]   Goliath, he's an enemy of God.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.540]   He was prideful in something other than God.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.840]   And when you become prideful about something,
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.920]   you are playing in the enemy's territory
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.420]   when you are prideful of something other than God.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.320]   And so the question for us is today,
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.620]   who are the enemies of God?
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.560]   Who are those people, the groups out there
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.360]   that gather around and say,
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.860]   "We are prideful over something other than God,
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.320]   "over the one true God.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.060]   "We find identity in other things.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.900]   "We practice other things.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.700]   "We work in other ways.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.900]   "We do other things."
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.320]   Who are those Goliaths today?
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:22.120]   And how do we lovingly, winsomely, kindly,
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.840]   but courageously stand in opposition
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.380]   to those who stand in opposition to God?
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.340]   His culture always has and always will
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.020]   until Jesus returns, mocked God.
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.520]   James 4, 6 says, "God opposes the proud,
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.180]   "but gives grace to the humble.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.180]   "He favors the humble."
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.680]   If you're here in your pride,
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.420]   for you stand in opposition to the creator
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.760]   of the heavens and the earth.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.940]   When you trust in fleeting things, you face failure.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.440]   When you put your faith in fleeting things,
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.860]   you face failure.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.360]   Verse 11, "On hearing the Philistines' words,
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.600]   "Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified."
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.000]   And he goes on to say that David,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.440]   he's the youngest son of Jesse,
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.040]   and Jesse was from Bethlehem in Judah,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.080]   telling you that Christ, Jesus Christ,
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.340]   comes from the lineage of King David.
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.540]   Jesse had eight sons.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:16.820]   He was very old.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.520]   And his three oldest sons followed Saul to war.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.960]   That was Eliab, Ben-Hadad, and Shammah.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.880]   They're at war.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.560]   And it says, "For 40 days," verse 16,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.860]   "For 40 days the Philistine came forward
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.500]   "every morning and evening and took his stand."
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.600]   This 40 days is the time of judgment in the scripture.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.100]   It rained in Noah's time for how long?
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.340]   40 days.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.600]   Jesus was tempted in the desert for how long?
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.800]   40 days.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.980]   And for 40 days, Goliath, the Philistine,
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.720]   stands in opposition to God's army.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.480]   It is a time of judgment for God's people.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.880]   And so Jesse comes to David and says,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.280]   "Hey, I want you to go check on your brothers."
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.620]   He says, "Hey, I want you to take grain
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.120]   "and bread and roasted corn and ten cheeses
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.860]   "to the commander of their unit."
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:58.920]   He's the cheese boy.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.160]   That's who he is.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.960]   He's coming and bringing them hors d'oeuvres.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.000]   That's what David, he's like, "You want some gouda?"
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.200]   That's what he's doing.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.940]   And so David leaves the sheep with a shepherd
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.700]   and goes where the armies are lined up.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.240]   Verse 22.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.300]   "David left his things with the keeper of supplies.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.500]   "He ran to the battle lines
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.840]   "and asked his brothers how they were."
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.340]   He's like, "You want some refreshments?
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.720]   "A concession stand, evidently."
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   "As he was talking with them,
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.520]   "Goliath, the Philistine, champion from Gath,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.320]   "stepped out from his lines
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.320]   "and shouted his usual defiance."
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.260]   And David heard it.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.120]   "Whenever the Israelites saw the man,
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.060]   "they all fled from him in great fear."
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.600]   Now, the Israelites had been saying,
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.640]   "Do you see how this man keeps coming out?
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.160]   "He comes out to defy Israel.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.340]   "The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him.
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.840]   "He will also give him his daughter in marriage
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.940]   "and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel."
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.140]   This text says this three times.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.580]   Okay, whoever will kill this guy,
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.880]   he gets the girl, okay?
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.780]   He doesn't have to pay taxes, right?
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.580]   He has all of these things.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.960]   He goes on to being royalty, right?
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.920]   It's a sweet deal.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.620]   He gets money, he gets the girl,
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.320]   and he doesn't have to pay taxes still today,
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.460]   a very sweet deal.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.400]   And so David hears this.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.040]   He's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?"
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.800]   He asks, he's like, "Hey, tell me this again.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.840]   "What are you saying?
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.300]   "What, like, you gotta be paid
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.680]   "to stand in opposition to that
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.280]   "and stand in opposition to God?
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.580]   "Hold on, tell me again what's gonna happen?
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.220]   "Are you serious?"
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.460]   In verse 29, I'm sorry, verse 28.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.260]   "When Eliab," that's David's oldest brother,
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.000]   "heard him speaking with the men,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.800]   "he burned with anger at him and asked,
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.660]   "'Why have you come down here?
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.400]   "'And whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness?
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.040]   "'I know how conceited you are
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.700]   "'and how wicked your heart is.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.880]   "'You came down here only to watch the battle.'"
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.440]   Isn't it interesting that David's faithfulness
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.680]   is misunderstood as arrogance?
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.240]   This is gonna happen to you.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.780]   People are gonna say, as you choose not to do wrong,
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.580]   as you choose to worship the one true God,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.160]   they're gonna say, "Why are you so arrogant?
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.960]   "What, do you think you're better than us?
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.820]   "No, no, no, why are you judging us?
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.660]   "What are you talking about judging?
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.260]   "I'm not gonna do that.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.400]   "I don't need to go do that.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.700]   "Why are you so arrogant?"
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.800]   That's what, this is gonna happen.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.700]   His faithfulness is seen as arrogance.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.140]   Verse 29, "Now what have I done?"
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.340]   David said, "Can't I even speak?"
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.580]   "He then turned away to someone else
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.820]   "and brought up the same matter
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.340]   "and the men answered him as before."
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.180]   What's gonna happen?
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.940]   You're telling me that this guy gets the money,
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.680]   no taxes and the girl?
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.020]   "What David said was overheard and reported to Saul
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:42.960]   "and Saul sent for him.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.980]   "David said to Saul,
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.200]   "'Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.720]   "'Your servant will go and fight him.'
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.140]   "Saul replied, 'You are not able to go out
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.860]   "'against this Philistine and fight him.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.540]   "'You are only a young man
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.360]   "'and he has been a warrior from his youth.'"
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.020]   And so I told you the first thing
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.580]   is when you trust in yourself,
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.820]   when you have faith in yourself,
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.860]   it can appear as arrogance.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.700]   It can also appear as something else, fear.
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.460]   Anytime you put too much faith in yourself,
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.740]   it can be fear.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.500]   It's this simple equation that is,
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.620]   if you look at the situation,
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.720]   you look at what you have,
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.800]   if you have more than what the situation calls for,
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.860]   you have a false confidence.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.900]   If you have less than what the situation calls for,
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.960]   you have fear.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.380]   Okay?
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.940]   This is a simple math.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.180]   This is faith placed in the wrong thing.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.740]   My second point is fear is misplaced faith.
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.780]   Fear, the emotion of fear is misplaced faith.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.460]   It's like, what, what, what?
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.820]   Will I be single forever?
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.480]   What if I never make that much money?
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.860]   What if I get laid off?
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.420]   What if I am not good enough?
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.740]   What if I don't have what it takes
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.100]   to get through that situation?
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.660]   What if your God does?
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:55.000]   What if your God is so big that he speaks things
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.920]   and they happen?
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.940]   What if he numbered your days?
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.700]   What if he ordained everything that's gonna happen to you,
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.060]   everything you're gonna walk in?
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.260]   What if he's enough?
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.100]   What if that?
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.060]   What if he's so powerful that he can move you
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.580]   through death back to life?
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.220]   That you can live in paradise with him
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.380]   forever and ever and ever
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.500]   so that your little worries in this world,
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.260]   these little things that you face,
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.700]   they're not that big for him.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.540]   What you see as a giant is not a giant for him.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.460]   Or it's his giant.
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:31.320]   The Israelites are terrified.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.800]   Saul is terrified.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.900]   And in simple logic, they should be.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.940]   If they're operating in the logic of this world,
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.260]   they should be terrified because they see a giant.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.580]   But if they're operating in the world of the supernatural,
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.260]   a God who created everything,
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.500]   why would they even think of being afraid?
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.860]   Say, oh, that's a giant.
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.980]   Man, my God is so much bigger than a giant.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.740]   Oh, that's a warrior.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.500]   But my God, that's my God's warrior.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.100]   He controls everything.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.040]   Why would I even think about being afraid?
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.760]   Oh, no, my senses, my common senses tell me to be afraid.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.720]   But my supernatural heart tells me not to fear anything
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.820]   but God himself.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:21.900]   This would be what some of us would do, right?
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.740]   We'd be afraid.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.260]   We'd be like, hey, come here, guys.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.380]   Let me tell you why you shouldn't fight Goliath.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.300]   No, he's really big and he's got bronze.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.260]   And this is why God would not want you to do this.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.160]   And David's like, hey, give me a rock.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.020]   Any stones around here?
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.980]   I'm tired of this guy mouthing off, man.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.280]   I gotta take care of this.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.120]   Hey, come here, David.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.820]   Let's sit down and let's apply some logic to this situation
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.660]   because I've been looking at Goliath and he's big.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.060]   He's like nine feet tall or something
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:49.940]   and you're not very big.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.220]   And he's got a sword and you don't.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.860]   And man, let's just talk about this for a minute
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.700]   because I don't know that this is
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.820]   what God would want for you.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.760]   Hey, you talk about it.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.120]   I'm gonna go get a rock.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:08.580]   The only thing necessary for evil to prevail
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.240]   is for good people to do nothing.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.380]   The only thing necessary in your lifetime
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.020]   for evil to win is for good people to do nothing.
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.720]   And friends, I want you to know that
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.260]   Goliath is not the problem here.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.540]   Unbelieving people are the problem here.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.300]   Goliath is not the issue here.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.860]   Unbelieving people, that's the issue here.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.860]   Goliath is no problem for God,
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.260]   but God's plan has always been to work
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.860]   through the faithfulness of others.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.760]   And so if there's no one there willing to be faithful,
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.260]   that presents a problem for God's plan.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.560]   Goliath isn't the issue.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.900]   People sitting on their rear ends,
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.920]   not wanting to do anything but pursue their comfort,
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.120]   that's the issue.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.500]   Giant ain't the issue.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.120]   Us pursuing the American dream
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.280]   and American Christianity, that's the issue.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.420]   Giants aren't the issue.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.000]   And so what's the bigger disgrace?
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.160]   Goliath's blaspheming or Israel's unbelief?
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.000]   I've heard it said that courage cannot exist
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   unless fear is present.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.160]   Unless fear is there, there can't be courage.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.000]   I will tell you for Christians,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.400]   unless faith is there, there can't be courage.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.440]   Unless we believe in something greater than ourselves,
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.820]   we cannot act out of courage.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.040]   Because if we did, it wouldn't be courage,
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.080]   it would just be cockiness.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.060]   It would be false arrogance.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.800]   It would be strength and trust in our own abilities
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.720]   and God determines the outcome.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.440]   God topples giants.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.960]   You may think you're good enough.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.720]   You may think you have money.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.120]   You may think you have a palace.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.560]   You may think you have everything that the world wants
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.280]   and he can shake it loose like a trap door
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.480]   out from underneath you.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.640]   And you're less devastated
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.000]   because you placed your faith in the wrong things
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.040]   and I've seen it happen with my own eyes
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.360]   over and over and over again.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.320]   And it's gonna happen to some of you here.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.480]   It's gonna happen to some of you.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.120]   You're gonna leave here, you're gonna hear this message
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.960]   and you're gonna be like,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.200]   I know, I'm gonna be the exception, man.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.740]   Like a trap door.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.040]   It's gonna fall out from underneath you.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   May it never be.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.880]   And so let me ask you two questions.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.600]   Two questions.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.100]   I want you to think about 'em.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.880]   What do you fear?
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.600]   What do you fear?
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.840]   (coughing)
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:42.640]   The second question.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.960]   Why?
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.520]   Why do you fear it?
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.900]   What are you afraid of?
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.960]   I get discouraged because I've noticed
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:03.160]   that mature Christians seem to grow uncourageous.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.840]   Like the Israelites in the story.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.040]   Some people, the longer they know God,
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   they learn more about him.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.420]   The less courageous they become,
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.120]   they get so much wisdom.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.080]   It's like, I don't think we need to do anything there.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.340]   That's a giant.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:24.760]   And I've noticed, 'cause I've done this for a little while,
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.980]   that a lot of times it's the brand new believers.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.240]   Like, I just trusted in Christ,
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.440]   why didn't anybody tell me this?
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.960]   He died for my sins, he came back from the death,
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.440]   what do I have to be afraid of?
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.800]   Hey, where is hell and where is a water gun?
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.380]   'Cause I'm going, you know, like those guys, right?
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.280]   I've just noticed this, that sometimes those people
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.400]   are the most courageous and others are like,
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.880]   no, I've wised up, I grew up in Sunday school, man,
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   you don't wanna do that, hell is hot.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.840]   You know?
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.440]   And I don't know why, it bothers me.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.680]   It bothers me.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.240]   I think sometimes we're growing towards God
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.680]   and our faith is getting smaller and smaller
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.600]   and smaller and smaller.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.800]   We've believed some lie in this American dream
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   that God wants me to be comfortable
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.720]   and he doesn't really want me to get uncomfortable.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.320]   And I can just take it easy and be in church
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.240]   and Sunday school and everything's gonna be okay
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.080]   and Jesus comes back and I get to go to heaven
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.880]   and it's all good.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.580]   Yeah, but you wasted your days, man.
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.300]   Like, what did you do with your life?
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.220]   I think we read this story
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:38.540]   and we think, man, this was David's moment.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.380]   Like, David knew, like, this is a dream situation,
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.620]   David's gonna fight the giant and he gets to show people
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.300]   that he's courageous, David wasn't courageous.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.780]   Okay, let me say something.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.420]   If you say he is, that's fine, I won't disagree with you
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.060]   and that's fine, but I'm just gonna say,
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.500]   to make this point,
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.380]   and I believe it's true, David wasn't courageous.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.340]   He was faithful.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.260]   David did what David had always done.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.220]   I'm just gonna trust God, guys, as a giant.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.100]   I mean, I've been trusting God my whole life,
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.620]   it's kinda worked out for me.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.580]   Like, every day I apply faith
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.300]   and in this situation it's no different,
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.900]   I'm just going to apply faith.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.700]   I'm gonna have the courage to do right
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.900]   and the courage not to do wrong, okay?
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.220]   This guy's doing wrong, I'm doing right,
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.300]   this guy's doing wrong, I just have faith
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.980]   that God doesn't like that dude,
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.420]   that big dude talking about him,
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.540]   so I'm just gonna step up and give God a chance
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.740]   to use me if he wants to,
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.660]   but I'm just going to have faith, okay?
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.460]   This was an everyday, normal faith for David,
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.500]   it's the way that he lived,
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.020]   and so you can ask yourself the question,
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.420]   what is God asking you to do today that requires courage?
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.820]   And if you think of something specific, that's great,
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.700]   what is God asking you to do today that requires courage?
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.380]   And here's what I'm saying, everything!
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.660]   Live, that you would walk by faith,
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.140]   that you would put yourself in situations
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.860]   where you need to be rescued,
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.700]   that God would have to intervene,
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.820]   that you would live so courageously, so boldly,
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.140]   so very, very different than what you've seen
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.820]   from your friends in America who call themselves Christian,
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.820]   you would be radical, you would say,
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.020]   I'm going against the grain for the name of Jesus,
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.580]   not just to stand out, to draw attention to me,
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.940]   but to shine a light on him,
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.460]   to show the world who he is and how amazing he is
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.940]   and what he's done for me.
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:39.040]   I just got back from vacation.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.100]   I didn't get a Palm Beach TAN membership,
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.620]   no, I've been on the beach with my family,
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.660]   it's been incredible, and we go somewhere once a year,
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.740]   and this was that once a year,
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.140]   and great time, man, on vacation.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.100]   Didn't really check emails much.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.460]   You sit back about two days,
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.420]   it takes kind of for the Lord to calm my heart,
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.980]   and then I'm there, and on vacation you get pampered,
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.460]   you know, it's just like the meals are taken care of,
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.100]   and there's not a lot of thinking,
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.740]   not a lot of planning, not a lot of responsibilities.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.560]   And what happens is about day four or five,
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.180]   my heart gets really used to it.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.740]   And I start, I've been this really familiar to me,
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.940]   I'm like, man, maybe I could have a shack on the beach,
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.380]   man, like maybe this is what we should do,
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.580]   like where would my kids go to school?
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.180]   Yeah, I bet we could make that work.
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.900]   Maybe like a surf stand or something.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.980]   Some of my, no, I just kind of want to take it easy,
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.300]   you know, like this is, I like the pace here.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.380]   A little slower.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.260]   Man, I didn't worry about anything today,
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.660]   I mean, just like, this is okay,
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.980]   and I start living in that, I start daydreaming,
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.660]   I start thinking, man, maybe I don't have to go back.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.660]   Maybe I can just take life easy and coast.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.460]   And it's like this internal war in me,
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.300]   because that raises up,
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.420]   and I kind of begin to feed that thought.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.460]   Like some of us feed fears, whatever we feed grows, right?
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.740]   And I begin to feed that thought,
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.040]   and that thought grows and it grows and it grows,
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.980]   and then praise God, I wake up.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.980]   Oh man, I want to change the world.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.680]   Send me back to Dallas and give me a rock.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.140]   And a couple thousand young adults.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.780]   Let's do work, man.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.900]   There's Goliaths in our midst,
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.580]   and I don't want to waste my life.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.340]   I don't want to get up to heaven
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.140]   with a collection of seashells, man.
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.300]   Okay, that's not what I'm after, that's not the dream.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.900]   That what's so interesting about that whole story
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.020]   is my greatest fear,
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.620]   if I was to be as vulnerable with you as I can,
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.340]   my greatest fear in life is that I would waste my life.
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.940]   That I would get to the end of this race
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.940]   and it didn't matter, there would be nothing.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.060]   No one saved, no one in heaven because of the way I lived.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.620]   No eternal significance whatsoever,
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.500]   no treasure stored up there with God, nothing.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.940]   Fleeting things, bricks and mortar that will crumble.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.200]   Collections, seashell collections.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.540]   That's my greatest fear,
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.880]   and yet that's the war inside of me when I taste it.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.780]   I don't want that for me,
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.520]   and I don't want that for you,
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.960]   'cause it ain't the Christian life.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.320]   The Christian life is take up your cross and follow him.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.780]   Live on mission, be a light.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.700]   Tell others about the way that they can live forever
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.500]   and ever and ever and ever with God.
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.840]   Oppose evil, stand in opposition to that
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.920]   which stands in opposition to God courageously.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.640]   Share truth, the life-changing truth of the gospel.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:45.900]   But we don't do that when we see Goliath.
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.860]   We do that every day.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:53.180]   The day before I left for vacation, I went to the gym
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.460]   'cause I was gonna have my shirt off,
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.660]   and that's what you do is you go to the gym.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:01.660]   But I worked out legs, so that breaks down a little bit.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.420]   So I went to the gym, worked out legs,
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.680]   and I don't work out legs ever.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.700]   And so on this particular day I did, and it was hard.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.700]   And here's what I learned is my legs are embarrassingly weak
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.020]   like really, really weak, okay?
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.500]   Like people are laughing at me in the gym.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.740]   Like toothpicks under a squat bar are weak.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:23.860]   Like that's me.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.840]   And the reason is is because as I said,
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.180]   I never work out legs.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:33.260]   And if you never exercise something, it's weak.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.760]   You don't exercise your faith when you see a Goliath.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.260]   You use the faith you exercise every day
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.460]   when you see Goliath.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.480]   Do you hear me?
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.140]   You can't just say, okay, now I see a Goliath,
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.140]   let me use my faith.
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.540]   No, every day you use your faith
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.920]   so that when you see Goliath, it's just normative.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.780]   I'm just gonna put my faith into practice, let's do work.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:03.540]   And so stop partying and do something with your life.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:08.380]   Stop wasting your life and use it.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.500]   Verse 34, "But David said to Saul,
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.760]   "your servant has been keeping his father's sheep."
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.880]   Saul's like, you can't do this.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.860]   He's like, yes I can.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:18.800]   I've been a shepherd.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.460]   "When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.600]   "from the flock, I went after it.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.700]   "I struck it and I rescued the sheep from its mouth.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.480]   "When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.960]   "I struck it and killed it.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.700]   "Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear.
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.460]   "This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.200]   "because he has defied the armies of the living God."
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.120]   And you might be tempted to think here that,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.680]   well, David's kind of arrogant.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.420]   I mean, he's boasting in his skill
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.780]   against the lion and the bear.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.340]   And he's like, man, this, you know,
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.860]   same thing I did to them, I'm gonna do to this Philistine.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.500]   He's boasting in his gifts and his strength.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.700]   Let me, hold on, let me show you verse 37, the next verse.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.720]   "No, it's the Lord who rescued me.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:02.120]   "It's Jehovah Jireh, Jehovah Nisi, El Shaddai,
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.600]   "the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.160]   "the creator of the universe who came in and rescued me.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.880]   "And the same God who rescued me from the lion
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.760]   "and the bear is going to rescue me
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.880]   "from this uncircumcised Philistine
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.840]   "who defies the armies of the living God."
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.960]   My God's got me.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:24.420]   And I love that he says he rescued me.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.800]   I needed to be rescued.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.000]   How humble is that?
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.700]   I was in a situation, I consistently put myself
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.560]   in a situation that if God doesn't show up,
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.200]   I'm lunch for a lion.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:45.160]   If God doesn't rescue me, this evil will overpower me
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.340]   but he will rescue me.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.640]   The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.000]   and the paw of the bear will rescue me
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.240]   from the hand of this Philistine.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.160]   Saul said to David, "Go and the Lord be with you."
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.400]   It looks like he has a faith.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.680]   "Go and the Lord will be with you," but he doesn't.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.240]   Now come back, let me dress you in my tunic
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.560]   and my coat of armor and bronze helmet.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.640]   And David fastened on his sword over the tunic
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.480]   and tried walking around because he was not used to them.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.840]   Saul's like Goliath, he has faith in his stuff.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.780]   "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul,
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.280]   "because I'm not used to them."
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.980]   So he took them off and then he took his staff in his hand,
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.600]   chose five smooth stones from the stream,
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.500]   put them in a pouch of a shepherd's bag
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.480]   and with his sling in his hand approached the Philistine.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.320]   You might be tempted to say here,
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.240]   "Well, if you really had a faith,
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   "why did he grab five stones?
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.900]   "Why didn't he just grab one stone?"
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.680]   And I love this in the text, it's a historical account.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.840]   Grab five stones, that's why it's here, grab five.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.520]   And he doesn't know how God's gonna use it.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.600]   Like I could go one further and be like,
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.880]   "Well, if he really had a faith,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.080]   "why would he grab any stones?"
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.320]   'Cause he just went to throw in blows
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.320]   or something out there, like, "Why does he need any rocks?"
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.040]   You know, if you really have, and here's the deal,
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.600]   he's saying, "Hey, I don't know how God's gonna do this.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.500]   "I'm gonna go prepared and I'm gonna trust
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.920]   "that God is going to intervene in my efforts,
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.300]   "in my preparation.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.560]   "It's gonna be his power working through me.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.220]   "But I'm gonna look at the situation
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.720]   "and I'm gonna take what I need,
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.280]   "what I think I need in my human logic
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.000]   "and trust that God's gonna intervene and help me.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   "And so in case one misses or two misses,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.160]   "I don't know if God's gonna use the fourth stone
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.240]   "or the third stone, I'll take five, let's go."
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:37.760]   Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:42.760]   in front of him, #dirtyjobs, kept coming closer to David.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.820]   He looked David over and saw that he was little more
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.560]   than a boy, glowing with health and handsome,
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.800]   and he despised him.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.760]   He said to David, "Am I a dog that you come at me with sticks
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.860]   "and the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.160]   "Come here," he said, "and I will give your flesh
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.960]   "to the birds and the wild animals."
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.320]   I think he's angry.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.360]   David said to the Philistine, "You come against me
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.900]   "with sword and spear and javelin,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.380]   "but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty,
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:13.220]   "the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.700]   "This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.400]   "and I'll strike you down and cut off your head.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.580]   "This very day I will give the carcasses
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.200]   "of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals,
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.440]   "and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.540]   "All those gathered here will know
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:31.400]   "that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves,
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.860]   "for the battle is the Lord's,
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.760]   "and he will give all of you into our hands."
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.920]   As the Philistine moved closer to attack him,
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.360]   David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.840]   Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone,
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.960]   he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.200]   The stone sank into his forehead
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.120]   and he fell face down on the ground.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.240]   So David triumphed over the Philistine
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.720]   with a sling and a stone,
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.920]   and without a sword in his hand,
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.520]   he struck down the Philistine and killed him.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:13.600]   He had his faith in the right place.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:21.340]   The third point, faith placed in God always prevails.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:27.400]   Faith placed in God always prevails.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.680]   Faith is complete trust or confidence
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.720]   in someone or something.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.880]   David had complete faith,
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.720]   complete trust or confidence in God.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:41.120]   David's faith was in someone who would never disappoint.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.080]   He's called a man after God's own heart.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.720]   If you don't know what that means,
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.840]   Acts 13, verse 22 tells us,
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.240]   says that God says about David,
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.060]   "He will do anything that I ask of him."
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.860]   How great is that?
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.880]   God says, "I look down,"
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.200]   could you imagine if God says that about you?
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.340]   "I look at her and I say,
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.000]   "'She will do anything that I ask of her.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.540]   "'She'll do anything that I ask of her.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.680]   "'He'll do anything that I ask of him.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:10.240]   "'He's gonna steward money the way I ask him to.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:15.700]   "'He's gonna date the way that I ask him to.
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.600]   "'He's gonna pursue purity the way that I ask him to.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.180]   "'He's gonna pursue sobriety the way that I ask him to.
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.580]   "'He does everything that I ask him to.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.280]   "'He's faithful, she's faithful.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.960]   "'Everything that I ask of her, she does.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.720]   "'They work as though they are working for me, not for man.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.400]   "'They do everything that I ask of him.'"
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.340]   2 Chronicles 16, verse nine says,
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.500]   "For the eyes of the Lord reigns throughout the earth
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.500]   "to strengthen those whose hearts
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.440]   "are fully committed to him."
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.320]   He looks down, he says,
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.400]   "Hey, I wanna fight some Goliaths today.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.760]   "Whose heart's mine?
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.780]   "Whose heart do I have?
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.880]   "Who do I wanna use?"
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.920]   In 1999, around the same time
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.860]   I'd gotten that cowardly little skirmish,
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:05.840]   there was a shooting in Columbine High School.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:12.140]   Two guys came in with weapons and pipe bombs and guns
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.940]   wanting to wreak havoc on the school,
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.400]   and specifically they targeted Christians.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:20.160]   They were upset, confused young men.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.360]   They went up to a girl named Rachel Scott,
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.320]   a known Christian on the campus.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.600]   They shot her in each of her legs
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.920]   and shot her in her torso.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.520]   And then they asked her again,
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.820]   "Are you a Christian?" with a gun to her head.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.560]   And she looked them in the eyes and she said,
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.720]   "You know that I am."
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.360]   By an eyewitness account who was there.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.680]   And they shot her.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.680]   And they said, "Then go be with him."
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:53.500]   And what happened out of that was the Rachel Scott movement,
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.420]   the gospel moved throughout public schools,
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.360]   all throughout our nation.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.860]   It continues to do so.
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.840]   The movement even from '99 gains momentum.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.300]   And I remember Christians in that day saying,
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.680]   "Man, I wish somebody would do that to me,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.560]   "put a gun to my head, ask me if I'm a Christian.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.960]   "And show I'm, I'll show that, you know."
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.660]   I'm like, "Yeah, I'm a Christian."
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.320]   Why don't you show them today
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.320]   without a gun to your head?
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.220]   And they're like, "Oh man, there was a Goliath here,
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.860]   "you know, give me a slingshot."
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.900]   Well, how about the way you date?
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:32.580]   How about what you find identity in?
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.360]   How about the way you party?
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.700]   How about how you spend your weekends?
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.820]   How about your thought life, your obsessions?
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.420]   You're so courageous.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.020]   I wanna courageously change the world,
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.260]   but I don't wanna courageously change myself.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.380]   Right, I want the faith to change the world,
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.580]   but I don't have the faith to change myself.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:51.920]   Right?
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:56.260]   God is looking for someone who has the courage
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.560]   to do the right thing and not do the wrong thing.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.120]   Sometimes it takes more courage not to do the wrong thing
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.320]   than to do the right thing,
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.880]   but he's using someone who practices their faith.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.200]   On this account, David had the faith to fight a giant,
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.760]   but David had a low point in his career.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.040]   It's when he lacked faith.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.840]   He put faith in his desires.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.080]   It's 2 Samuel chapter 11,
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.360]   when he saw someone by the name of Bathsheba,
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.840]   and he took another man's wife and he slept with her,
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.100]   and it was David's downfall.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.740]   It was the beginning of the end for King David
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.400]   because he lost that faith.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.700]   He lost sight of that faith,
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.600]   and he trusted something other than God.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:43.520]   Verse 51, but on this day, he was victorious.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.060]   David ran and stood over him.
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.940]   He took hold of the Philistine sword
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.220]   and drew it from the sheath.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.380]   After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.280]   Good night, kids.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.900]   When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead,
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.660]   they turned and ran.
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.260]   When the men of Israel and Judah surged forward
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.860]   with a shout and pursued the Philistines
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.460]   to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron,
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.900]   the dead were strewn along the Shurim road
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.600]   to Gath and Ekron.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:15.140]   Don't you see what's happening, friends?
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.340]   This story is about a man
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:22.460]   who fought on behalf of his people.
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:27.300]   It's Goliath, the champion, the man who goes between,
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.980]   says, "Hey, I will fight on behalf of my army
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.740]   "and a type of Christ."
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.660]   David, the shepherd, shows up,
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.960]   someone who's from his lineage.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.940]   Jesus is gonna show up on the scene.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.200]   David steps up and says,
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.780]   "Oh, you want to represent all things evil.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.920]   "I'll represent all things God,
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.540]   "and you're going down.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.480]   "I will fight on behalf of God.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.500]   "I will fight on behalf of his people."
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:58.900]   And one man defeated evil.
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:47:59.900]   This is Jesus.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.160]   It's the gospel.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.100]   Jesus is the champion.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.440]   Goliath was always the underdog.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.900]   Goliath was born to die in this battle.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.620]   It's why he existed.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.260]   God created him to be defeated in this moment.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:18.860]   He was never, he never had a chance because he opposed God.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.400]   No one will ever have a chance opposing God.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.820]   No one wins in opposition to God.
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.940]   They do not ever win.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.060]   The most powerful force in the world
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.580]   will always prevail over that evil.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.340]   And it happened on the cross about 2,000 years ago
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:41.340]   when all of the sins, the very sins you felt guilty for
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:46.340]   over the past 45 minutes went on Jesus Christ,
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.620]   the man who went between,
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:52.820]   the man who stepped in the gap,
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.100]   and he was crushed for your sake.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.180]   He was the king.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:02.160]   And so today you live by faith in him.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.460]   You walk by faith in him.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.300]   I know he died for my sins.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.900]   I know God raised him from the dead.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.620]   What do I have to be afraid for?
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.540]   What's the worst thing that could happen to me?
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.380]   Death?
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.960]   No, you get to go through that.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.600]   It's a paradise.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.000]   God's kingdom.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.560]   This is the story of Jesus.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:32.060]   This is the story of the gospel.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.820]   Hebrews 12, two and three says,
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.660]   fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.380]   the pioneer and perfecter of faith.
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.620]   For the joy set before him endured the cross,
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:43.620]   scorning its shame,
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.360]   and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.420]   Consider him the champion, the one who went between,
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.380]   who endured such opposition from sinners
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:56.260]   so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.980]   And so check this out.
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:03.680]   We step onto the battlefield with the trophy in our hands,
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.060]   with the crown in our hand.
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.260]   The victory is ours.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.820]   We fight from a position of victory
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.980]   that the battle over sin has already been won
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.380]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.540]   Pornography does not win in your life.
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:18.660]   That abortion will not get the best of you.
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.780]   Drunkenness does not consume you through the grave.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.900]   Jesus paid for it.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:30.000]   You can stop finding identity in men and relationships.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.100]   You can stop spending money
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.380]   like you're going to fill that void in your heart.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:39.700]   You can stop finding identity in your image,
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:44.700]   who you know, what you do, where you work, what you drive.
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:48.980]   It's been paid for.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.300]   It's been purchased.
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.380]   You live forever with God.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:57.420]   You have a go between a man who stood in the gap
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.300]   and fought on your behalf.
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.960]   Let me pray and we'll worship him.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:04.720]   (pastor sighing)
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:15.080]   Father, thank you for example of Christ.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:20.240]   Would you stir in us a courage
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.180]   that comes from a trusting in you completely,
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:28.720]   not when there's a gun to our head or a giant in our midst,
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.880]   but when we wake up in the morning,
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.340]   when we go to bed tonight, when we drive home.
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:40.180]   Help us not to give the enemy our thought life.
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:44.700]   Help us to take captive our obsessions,
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.440]   the thoughts that circle in our head
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   that feed fears and arrogance and false confidence.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.560]   Father, if you need to take things in our lives
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.720]   that distract us from you
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.920]   so that we would be greater servants of you,
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.640]   so be it.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.860]   What a scary prayer.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.440]   What a terrifying idea.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.540]   But if you need to take relationships,
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:12.400]   if you need to take money,
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.140]   if you need to take positions,
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:17.640]   if you need to take things that we trust in instead of you
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.680]   so that we would trust in you, so be it.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.180]   But God, be merciful.
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:27.560]   Would you mercifully help us to trust in you completely?
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.520]   Would you become greater, God,
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.400]   so that we might become less?
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:39.000]   I don't know what you're afraid of, man.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.100]   I know the only thing you have to be afraid of is God.
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.560]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.680]   And that God is crazy about you.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:55.040]   He is ridiculously, madly in love with you.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.720]   I bet the farm on that truth.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:59.120]   I bet everything I've gone all in on that truth.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.080]   I'm asking you to.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.080]   He's like, what do I gotta do to show you that I love you?
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.840]   You want me to give my son on your behalf?
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.680]   Done.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.680]   Done, game over.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.680]   Died for everything you've done
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.240]   so that you don't have to pay for it.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:16.640]   So if you trust in that,
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.160]   you can be with him forever and ever and ever.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.160]   What do you have to be afraid of?
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.480]   And can I tell you something else?
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   You're not that good.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.040]   You're not that good.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.160]   You don't have what it takes.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.280]   I'm not trying to beat you up.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.760]   I'm just saying the things that you trust in, man,
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.960]   they're gonna fail you one day.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.480]   And if they're the only things you trust in,
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:42.120]   you're going to face despair and depression and devastation.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.680]   And I just, I love you guys.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.840]   I'm just tired of having that conversation.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.280]   I'm tired of talking to one more rich, young ruler
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.080]   who trusted in all the wrong things.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.920]   They're handsome and they're beautiful.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.120]   And they got great degrees and good jobs
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.040]   and they just found themselves
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.320]   where they just can't stop being sad.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.600]   Like, oh man, I know why you're sad.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.080]   You trust in the wrong things.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.800]   You trust in things that are gonna disappoint you.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.000]   Of course you're sad.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.760]   But I know someone that's not gonna disappoint you.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.240]   Someone that's eternally fixed.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.880]   Someone that is eternally strong.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.640]   Eternally wise.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.480]   Someone who loves you.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.880]   Someone who's numbered your days.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.360]   Someone who's always gonna be with you.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.440]   Someone who's never gonna disappoint you.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.280]   That when you find yourself all alone,
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.560]   you're not alone, they're with you.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.120]   Someone you can trust in completely.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:40.400]   Someone, the only one, who can carry you through the grave
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.640]   from death to life, into eternity, into paradise,
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.840]   into his kingdom forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.080]   and you're not going to be the first one
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:53.200]   in the history of history to pursue the world and get it.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.960]   And what does it forfeit a man to gain the whole world
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.200]   yet forfeit his soul?
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:06.320]   What does it give a man or a woman to do that?
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.440]   Don't be crazy.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.280]   Pursue Christ.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.760]   He's enough.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.600]   He's yours.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:24.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
