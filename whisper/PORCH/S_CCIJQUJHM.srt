1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,520
 - I love it.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,780
 Well, welcome friends in the room and in Fort Worth,

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,560
 in Houston, El Paso, Tulsa, the Woodlands, Spring,

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,380
 Cedar Rapids, Tokyo, wherever you're tuning in from,

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,260
 we are excited to continue this series, The Remnant.

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,100
 What's The Remnant?

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,200
 It is the people of God.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,520
 It is the ones that God has preserved

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,360
 throughout every time in all of history.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,120
 As I was preparing for this message,

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,040
 I was working with kind of a team

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,600
 that helps create the sermon prep stuff.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,920
 And one of the things that came up,

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,360
 it'll make sense in a second,

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,840
 will give us a good framework for launching

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,800
 into what we're gonna talk about tonight.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,920
 And it was the subject of the number of things

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,380
 that in school you and I were taught

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,420
 that really have no involvement in our life today.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,260
 Like the number of things

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,680
 that all throughout elementary school

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,240
 and through junior high and high school

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
 and the number of different things,

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,000
 if you think back on it, that you'd be like,

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,520
 "Oh man, yeah, I did learn that.

27
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,600
 "What was that for, huh?"

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,020
 And so we came up with a handful of 'em

29
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,680
 that if you really, for most of us,

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,040
 it's just funny how much time you spend focusing on this

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,080
 and pop quizzes and tests,

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,000
 and then it's just kind of,

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,080
 it's gone with the wind forever.

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,220
 Here's a few of 'em.

35
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,600
 Long division.

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,400
 Most of us, does anyone use long division

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,780
 on a regular basis?

38
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,920
 It's like, and if you do,

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,280
 we gotta get you a calculator, friend.

40
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,880
 (audience laughing)

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,520
 A protractor and a compass.

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,140
 You remember this thing?

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,640
 What sort of space age weird, just,

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,440
 I mean, I know engineers in the room are like,

45
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,820
 "Actually, I use one every day.

46
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,900
 "I've got one right here if anyone needs it actually."

47
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,280
 But for most of us, it's like,

48
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,340
 "Man, this thing that was, you know,

49
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,540
 "I'm not even sure I ever learned how to properly use it,

50
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,820
 "but this thing was a part of our life

51
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,620
 "that no longer, just for a season."

52
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,420
 How about cursive?

53
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,540
 Remember cursive?

54
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,100
 I think, someone told me they stopped

55
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,920
 teaching cursive in school.

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,780
 I mean, it's just, it's this thing that,

57
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,780
 aside from a signature, really, you don't use.

58
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,620
 Or in other words, most of us don't.

59
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,440
 In other words, it's always a little weird

60
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,380
 when you meet someone who still writes in cursive,

61
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,020
 and you're like, and they're under the age of 60,

62
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,860
 and you're like,

63
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,420
 is that for real right there?

64
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,900
 It's just, it's one of those things that you were taught.

65
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,140
 Here's another one, dissecting a frog.

66
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,460
 Yeah, who remembers that?

67
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,380
 Why did they have us dissect a frog?

68
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,460
 How about the recorder?

69
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,180
 Who remembers the recorder?

70
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,060
 Was this an instrument that was made

71
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,920
 just for elementary school kids?

72
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,180
 It's like, we can't give them a real instrument,

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,940
 just give them this.

74
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,740
 Like, I'm not even sure that that's,

75
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,660
 it's an official instrument, isn't it?

76
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,780
 It's just kind of like a starter tool that you use.

77
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,820
 I don't even know, honestly.

78
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,100
 So if you teach music, help us remove that.

79
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,780
 The periodic table.

80
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,060
 Remember memorizing this?

81
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,060
 And how relevant is that to your life right now?

82
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,400
 Boron, it's pretty much the only one I remember, potassium.

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,260
 Latin, maybe you went to a school

84
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,700
 where you were taught Latin.

85
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,540
 Just a bunch of things that, man,

86
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,020
 you know, you study, you take the quiz,

87
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,640
 and then it just kind of disappears.

88
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,420
 Ironically, here's the irony in all of that,

89
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,300
 of all the different things that you would need in life,

90
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,180
 you would think there'd be a little bit more incorporation

91
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,120
 of some of the things that like,

92
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,860
 when you get out in the real world, you're like,

93
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,680
 man, how come no one ever taught me this?

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,660
 Like, here would have been some better things, I think.

95
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,180
 How to do your taxes.

96
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,760
 How to do a budget.

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,700
 Like, you know, it's sick.

98
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,060
 Man, there's a lot of people excited about that.

99
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,940
 How to change the oil in your car,

100
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,860
 or even the fact that you need to change the oil

101
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,700
 in your car.

102
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,980
 How to do car registration, utilities, insurance,

103
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,260
 household repairs, like just kind of general

104
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,260
 household repairs, stress management, first aid or CPR.

105
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,180
 I mean, how much better would that be in PE

106
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,540
 than like, hey, climb this rope,

107
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,260
 learn how to do first aid or CPR of use of your time,

108
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,020
 better life skill, interview skills,

109
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,260
 or negotiation skills, stress management.

110
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,680
 And then lastly, conflict resolution.

111
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,260
 Of all the different things that you could have been taught,

112
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,100
 so many of those have been so much more valuable.

113
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,180
 And tonight we are talking about one of them

114
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,380
 that was not taught in the school that I know of,

115
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,380
 it certainly wasn't a part of my education experience,

116
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,420
 and that is conflict resolution.

117
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,100
 In other words, it wasn't a course when I went to college,

118
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,220
 or even when I went to grad school,

119
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,500
 there was no official kind of,

120
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,100
 hey, welcome, this is conflict 101 and how you resolve it.

121
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,580
 And yet, of all of those skills,

122
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,860
 more important than any other one,

123
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,980
 will conflict resolution determine your ability

124
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,700
 to experience joy, happiness in life,

125
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,660
 your ability to have relationships,

126
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,140
 which is a crucial part, everyone would say,

127
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,420
 regardless of what you believe,

128
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,700
 of having a life that has meaning and value

129
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,520
 and just happiness in general,

130
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,180
 that you can't have those without the ability

131
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,420
 to work through and resolve conflict.

132
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,460
 And yet, no one ever teaches it.

133
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,140
 And maybe you grew up in a home

134
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,020
 where it was taught you're the rare exception.

135
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,700
 For most of us, if we were taught anything

136
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,940
 about conflict resolution,

137
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,180
 it was really just by example and not a great example.

138
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,820
 We learn that dad can escalate a little too quick

139
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,440
 and mom can withdraw or be passive aggressive,

140
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,500
 or we learn kind of bad expressions

141
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,100
 of what it looks like to resolve conflict.

142
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,620
 And yet, of everything on that list

143
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,900
 and of so many different arenas,

144
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,300
 how crucial if you and I are gonna experience a life

145
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,560
 that is not just filled with superficial relationships,

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,380
 if you and I are gonna experience a life

147
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,380
 that's not filled with an unhealthy or unhappy marriage,

148
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,020
 if you and I are not gonna just burn bridges

149
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,340
 in every direction, we have got to have

150
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,500
 the skill of conflict resolution.

151
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,460
 And so tonight, we are gonna look

152
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,100
 at what God's Word says about the topic

153
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,020
 of conflict resolution.

154
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,700
 And what we're gonna discover

155
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,260
 and why we're covering this in this series

156
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,620
 is that the remnant is a people who resolve conflict.

157
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,580
 Jesus says this over and over and over again.

158
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,940
 He says, "My people are gonna be peacemakers.

159
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,080
 "My people are gonna be the ones

160
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,060
 "who bring conflict resolution about

161
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,500
 "in their relationships, in the places they live and work,

162
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,260
 "and where they do life."

163
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,680
 And yet, so few of us have ever really been taught it.

164
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,220
 So tonight, we are gonna explore the subject line

165
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,060
 of the remnant is a people who resolve conflict.

166
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,980
 The remnant is a people who resolve conflict.

167
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,820
 Here's what I know.

168
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,180
 If you will incorporate the stuff

169
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,300
 that we're about to talk about,

170
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
 regardless of what you believe,

171
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,560
 regardless of where you kind of are

172
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,060
 on the spiritual spectrum, your life will be better.

173
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,340
 You can leave, wake up tomorrow,

174
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,740
 incorporate the stuff that Jesus

175
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,380
 and really the Bible teaches in general,

176
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,540
 and you're gonna experience better relationships,

177
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,840
 you're gonna have more peace,

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,660
 you're gonna have less conflict.

179
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,620
 And so we're gonna dive in.

180
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,860
 This will be really kind of topical,

181
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,340
 which means we'll jump primarily in Matthew chapter five

182
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,220
 and Matthew 18 and a few other places,

183
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,160
 but we're gonna explore the teachings of Scripture

184
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,300
 as it relates to how you and I can be people

185
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,100
 who resolve the conflicts in our life.

186
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,660
 So we're gonna kick off the first idea

187
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,260
 and just explore three essentials for you and I

188
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,300
 if we're gonna be people who resolve our conflict.

189
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,880
 Three essentials for you and I to have in our life,

190
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,500
 three components of the skill of resolving conflict.

191
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,240
 The first one we're gonna pull

192
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,780
 from Matthew chapter five, verse nine.

193
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,420
 Jesus, like three sentences in to his ministry

194
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,740
 in something called the Sermon on the Mount,

195
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,900
 which is just his first kind of sermon

196
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,220
 that he launches into,

197
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,920
 he begins to talk about the idea of bringing peace

198
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,180
 and how his people bring peace.

199
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,380
 Here's what he says, verse nine.

200
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,500
 Blessed are the peacemakers,

201
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,460
 for they will be called children of God.

202
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,940
 Blessed are the peacemakers.

203
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,240
 Jesus says that there is a relationship

204
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,380
 between you being a child of God

205
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,100
 and your ability to make peace.

206
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,580
 In other words, that just like parents

207
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,780
 have different attributes

208
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,460
 that show up inside of their children,

209
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,020
 God is a heavenly father who has attributes

210
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,160
 that show up inside of his children,

211
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,580
 and one of the attributes that shows up

212
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,120
 inside of his children is the ability to make peace.

213
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,960
 And for you and I to know that every single conflict

214
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,440
 is an opportunity for us to bring about peace

215
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,320
 will require the first essential

216
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,800
 to the skill of resolving conflict

217
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,640
 is that we have to have a change in perspective,

218
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,720
 or a perspective change on the idea of conflict.

219
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,200
 Because conflict, I think a lot of us came in the room,

220
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,400
 and it's not our favorite subject to talk about.

221
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,120
 It's probably not our favorite thing to be a part of.

222
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,740
 We're not looking for more conflict in life.

223
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,080
 That's really what I'm looking for.

224
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,500
 Most of us didn't come in with that,

225
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,280
 and often we see it as something that is a bad thing,

226
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,720
 that man, every time there's conflict,

227
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,920
 that's really bad, right?

228
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,400
 Wrong.

229
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,800
 The Bible says you and I need to have a perspective change

230
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,240
 every time there's conflict.

231
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,160
 We need to have the perspective

232
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,840
 that we have a great opportunity

233
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,120
 to show the world who our heavenly father is,

234
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,220
 to show the world whose children we are, if you will,

235
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,880
 that our first point from tonight, from the text,

236
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,120
 is a perspective to change,

237
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,020
 and if you and I are going to be people

238
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,080
 who bring about peace, who resolve conflict,

239
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,640
 we have to be people who have a change in perspective.

240
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,600
 Conflict is not a bad thing,

241
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,200
 and it is an opportunity, if handled well,

242
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,120
 to show the world who our heavenly father is,

243
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,320
 or to honor our God, to strengthen relationships,

244
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,160
 and to grow ourself in general,

245
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,880
 and Jesus says, man, you will see the children of God

246
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,160
 will have this quality from their parents.

247
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,120
 My wife is due to have a baby on Friday,

248
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,480
 and yeah, I know, buckle up.

249
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,080
 You can pray for that, and for us,

250
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,360
 'cause we're about to not sleep,

251
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,920
 and one of the things that,

252
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,960
 like when you're about to have a baby,

253
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,480
 you begin to think through, and your mind can drift to,

254
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,360
 is like, oh, what kind of attributes are they gonna have,

255
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,400
 and what are they gonna look like?

256
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,560
 Here's what we pretty much know they're gonna look like.

257
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,840
 They're gonna have some attributes,

258
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,860
 either from their mother or father, from both,

259
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,080
 and they're gonna incorporate,

260
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,400
 I mean, it just kind of goes without saying,

261
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,780
 I know it's mind-blowing stuff,

262
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,640
 that they're gonna have attributes from their parents,

263
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
 or a child will have attributes from their parents.

264
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,440
 That's Jesus's point, that the children of God

265
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,280
 are gonna be people who bring about peace

266
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,120
 in their relationships.

267
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,880
 So you, someone who brings about peace,

268
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,600
 who moves in the direction of peace

269
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,400
 when there's conflict in your relationships,

270
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,480
 because Jesus says that is a quality

271
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,080
 that will mark his people.

272
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,880
 Not only is conflict a great opportunity,

273
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,100
 'cause it will honor God,

274
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,880
 or show who your heavenly father is,

275
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,760
 I mean, we've all experienced that conflict,

276
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,440
 when resolved well, strengthens relationships.

277
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,600
 That's an opportunity to strengthen your relationship.

278
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,400
 In other words, it doesn't have to drive you apart,

279
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
 it can drive you and make you stronger together.

280
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,920
 In fact, here's what's crazy.

281
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,680
 Even psychology, or people, non-Christians would say,

282
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,120
 that the ideal relationship,

283
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,840
 if you are the type of person in the room

284
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,040
 looking for the ideal dating relationship,

285
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,240
 this is for you, which is a lot of us.

286
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,120
 The ideal dating relationship,

287
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,360
 people often think has no conflict.

288
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,400
 And study after study says, man, conflict,

289
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,080
 if you have a relationship that has zero conflict,

290
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,520
 you are in trouble, because it's a sign of unhealth.

291
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,480
 In other words, if there's absence of conflict,

292
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,400
 generally, they would say, it either points

293
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,040
 to a codependency, or something really unhealthy,

294
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
 where one partner feels like they can't reject,

295
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,440
 or can't disagree at any point,

296
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,740
 or it points to a narcissist being involved,

297
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,800
 who only wants to be around people who get along with them.

298
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,760
 I mean, it kinda makes sense.

299
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,800
 I mean, if you only want to be around people

300
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,520
 who agree with you every time,

301
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,320
 it's really hard to respect someone

302
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,880
 who never disagrees with you.

303
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
 Think about that.

304
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,960
 Like, in other words, you'd be like, yeah,

305
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,320
 I just want someone who agrees with everything that I think.

306
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,680
 It's really hard to respect someone who just,

307
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,240
 they have nothing to offer you in life.

308
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,360
 They're like, whatever you say, that is our world.

309
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,560
 That's not someone who's like, man, I really respect you.

310
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,640
 And in a healthy relationship,

311
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,080
 there's respect for one another.

312
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
 So conflict is not a bad thing,

313
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,440
 or the absence of conflict is not necessarily a good thing.

314
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,440
 The presence of conflict resolution is a great thing.

315
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,300
 That if you wanna have a healthy relationship,

316
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,360
 it won't be just, man, I'm concerned,

317
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,140
 'cause we've had a few conflicts.

318
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,040
 It is not conflict alone that determines

319
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,000
 or whether it's a bad relationship.

320
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,840
 It is the ability to resolve conflict

321
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,480
 that will serve you in a dating relationship,

322
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,320
 in a marriage someday,

323
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,200
 because, man, you are going to have conflict.

324
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,280
 The skill of conflict resolution is like,

325
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,640
 man, a daily thing, 'cause we only fight in my house

326
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,920
 like once a day, but it's a crucial one,

327
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,800
 maybe twice sometimes.

328
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,560
 And resolving conflict is a crucial skill

329
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,840
 that you are gonna learn now,

330
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
 or you are gonna painfully learn

331
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,920
 through the school of hard knocks

332
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,460
 and wanna revisit this message at a later day.

333
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,880
 And so inside of your dating relationships,

334
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,920
 the ability to resolve and to move towards peace.

335
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,520
 And so we're gonna explore a little bit

336
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,720
 of the steps that are involved

337
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,320
 for you and I to be a part of that.

338
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,240
 Jesus, the last thing about conflict

339
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,600
 and the perspective we're to have

340
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,760
 is it is a big deal, he says.

341
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,320
 In Matthew chapter five, we're not gonna read this,

342
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,640
 but chapter five, verse 23 and 24, you can read it later.

343
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,080
 He essentially says, look, I want you to prioritize

344
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,280
 working through your conflicts,

345
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,160
 working through the problems in your relationships

346
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,760
 above even worshiping me.

347
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,840
 And so if you're in church,

348
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,500
 or you find yourself at a place where you're like,

349
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,660
 oh man, I'm focused on going to the service,

350
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,400
 and you realize you have a problem

351
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,760
 or you're in conflict with a brother or a sister,

352
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,560
 I want you to get up and I want you to leave

353
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,720
 and I want you to move in that direction.

354
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,440
 Some of you, the best thing you can do tonight

355
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,760
 is go to make a phone call,

356
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,040
 there's someone that you need to reach out to

357
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,740
 to begin to take the steps towards resolving the conflict.

358
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,580
 So that's the first thing,

359
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,460
 you and I have to have the perspective of man,

360
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,600
 conflict is not a bad thing,

361
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,240
 but it is a great opportunity

362
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,840
 to show the world who's our heavenly father

363
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,160
 or to honor our heavenly father.

364
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,740
 The second part of you and I experiencing the ability

365
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
 to resolve conflict inside of our life is this,

366
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,200
 that you and I have to know that in every conflict,

367
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,040
 you have a part to own.

368
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,040
 In every conflict, every single conflict

369
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,400
 you've ever been a part of,

370
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,720
 you have a role or you have played a part

371
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,080
 and you have a part that you need to own

372
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,740
 in the conversation where you need to ask for forgiveness,

373
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,180
 you need to call it what it is

374
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,340
 and own what you've done, own your fault.

375
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,580
 Jesus says this in Matthew chapter seven,

376
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,760
 verses three through five.

377
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,380
 Why do you look at the speck of dust in your brother's eye

378
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,320
 and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?

379
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,740
 How can you say to your brother,

380
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,700
 let me take that speck out of your eye

381
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,640
 when all the time there's a plank in your own eye,

382
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,540
 you hypocrite?

383
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,220
 First take the plank out of your own eye

384
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,280
 and then you will see clearly to remove the speck

385
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,320
 from your brother's eye.

386
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,800
 Gosh, I love it, you gotta love Jesus.

387
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
 He uses this like exaggerated scenario

388
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,200
 where he's like, look, you need to be someone

389
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,840
 who focuses on owning first your own faults,

390
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,320
 your own stuff, your own role in whatever conflict

391
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,240
 or whatever issues or disagreements that you've had

392
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,120
 and he uses an exaggerated situation

393
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,300
 where it's like there's a guy who has a plank,

394
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,720
 a two by four just sticking out of his eye,

395
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,600
 going around being like, hey, look, excuse me,

396
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,720
 I think I see something in your eye over there.

397
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,580
 I've got my tweezers out and Jesus would say,

398
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,000
 look, that's absurd.

399
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,020
 And his point is not that you should never be someone

400
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,860
 who reaches out and helps people see

401
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,700
 the speck in their eye,

402
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,420
 his point is that you need to prioritize

403
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,580
 and I need to prioritize owning my fault,

404
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,580
 owning my part in whatever disagreement first.

405
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,320
 In other words, before I'm gonna deal any with you,

406
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,900
 I wanna make sure that I'm someone who says,

407
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,620
 man, I need to own my own part here.

408
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,740
 This is, I think, the hardest part of resolving conflict

409
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,520
 because usually, like we can't really tell

410
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,600
 that we have a plank sticking out of our eye

411
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
 and we're just prone to think like,

412
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,280
 yeah, the biggest problem is because of her

413
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,140
 and if she would have just called him

414
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,420
 or she would have done X or he would have done X,

415
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,000
 then none of this would have happened anymore

416
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,920
 and we think that inside of our conflict,

417
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,340
 it's hard for me to see what my role was.

418
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,160
 Being awesome, is that what I need to apologize for?

419
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,360
 I'm being too nice, I'm just too much of a hard worker,

420
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,080
 I expect too much of people, what should I,

421
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,840
 and we don't sit there and thoughtfully say,

422
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,760
 man, what can I own?

423
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,520
 How can I see this from the other person's perspective?

424
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,860
 How can I be someone who owns the ways

425
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,120
 that I could have communicated better,

426
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,320
 the ways that maybe my tone or the words that I use

427
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,240
 could have been better,

428
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,200
 the timing that I had could have been better?

429
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,120
 What are the things that I can sit down and I'm gonna own?

430
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,780
 I just wanna start with this.

431
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,600
 I wanna own that the way that I told you,

432
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,080
 or the way that I spoke to you in that moment

433
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,920
 could have been better.

434
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,200
 Will you please forgive me?

435
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,400
 And Jesus would say, whatever you can,

436
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,600
 own in those different situations.

437
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,000
 And so, I'm gonna go one step further

438
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
 and incorporate a tool that we use around here

439
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,400
 in some other ministries that can help you identify

440
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,960
 some of the different tendencies that all of us have

441
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,800
 when it relates to conflict.

442
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,680
 Some of the different bad patterns that most of us get into

443
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,000
 are our default is, because oftentimes,

444
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,880
 it's kind of our default that will lead us,

445
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,440
 usually in a step towards discovering in the conflict

446
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,160
 what my role is, and it's something called weenie,

447
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,520
 that all of us need to know our weenie.

448
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,440
 What is a weenie?

449
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,160
 A weenie is the four negative types of conflict resolution

450
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,440
 or conflict patterns that people have

451
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,760
 that usually, by and large,

452
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,280
 people fit into one of these categories,

453
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,480
 W being withdrawal, E being escalate,

454
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,560
 N being negative interpretation, I being invalidate.

455
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,280
 Withdrawal, do I withdraw, do I escalate?

456
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,600
 What is my conflict pattern?

457
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,280
 Because generally speaking, it's one of these

458
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,180
 that's kind of a part of how I acted in a way

459
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,760
 that man, was not God's best, and I need to own my part.

460
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,960
 Do I withdraw, do I escalate?

461
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,360
 Am I a negative interpreter, am I invalidator?

462
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,760
 Maybe I'm all of the above.

463
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,000
 For me, I am an escalator and an invalidator,

464
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,080
 and so I'm the type of person who almost,

465
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,600
 I kind of have something in part of me

466
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,240
 that likes conflict, or it's weird, it's like a debate,

467
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,720
 and I'm like, yeah, let's do this.

468
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,240
 Here's what I think is wrong with you,

469
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,640
 and get the PowerPoint back up there.

470
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,640
 And I can just escalate and cause a lot of harm

471
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,000
 inside of my marriage, and I'm married to a withdrawer,

472
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,200
 which is an awesome recipe, 'cause it's like,

473
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,840
 get back here! (laughs)

474
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,920
 That's so bad.

475
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,480
 We're working on it, guys, we're in community,

476
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,720
 and Jesus is taking ground.

477
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,000
 But those are our tendencies, so me,

478
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 or even with our team, my tendency can be

479
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,320
 to invalidate, and to further invalidate

480
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,000
 when someone comes and expresses like,

481
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,080
 hey, it hurt me when you said that.

482
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,960
 And I'm like, well, here's why you shouldn't have been hurt,

483
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,560
 and give 18 reasons why, yeah, this is your problem, okay?

484
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,680
 Let's pray for you.

485
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,120
 (congregation laughs)

486
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,760
 And it's wrong, and it is, to whatever degree

487
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,640
 I allow it to continue, or I allow it to happen,

488
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,560
 it's hurting my relationships.

489
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,320
 And so inside of the conflicts that you have,

490
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,240
 you have a part to own, you probably have a style,

491
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,960
 or some ways that you are dysfunctional

492
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,120
 in the ways that you conflict.

493
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,760
 Are you a withdrawer, an escalator,

494
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
 a negative interpreter, or an invalidator?

495
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,440
 The third step, so that's our second,

496
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,840
 you and I have a perspective to have,

497
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,600
 which is that conflict's an opportunity, it's not bad.

498
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,480
 You and I have a part to own.

499
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,640
 I have to own 100% of my 2%, even if it's just 2%.

500
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,560
 98% of the conflict is their fault.

501
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,240
 Like, yes, I forgot the birthday cake,

502
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,760
 they forgot the birthday.

503
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,760
 And I have to own all of my 2%, all of my 1%.

504
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,640
 Whatever part I have in the conflict,

505
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,560
 I wanna own 100% of that, and I wanna lead out with that.

506
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,320
 And then, finally, the scriptures lay out,

507
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,520
 or we're gonna spend more of our time here,

508
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,900
 a path to pursue peace.

509
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,960
 The Bible really makes it as clear as any of the other

510
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,480
 skills that maybe we talk about

511
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,120
 inside of this series on the remnant.

512
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,920
 There is a path Jesus gives, kinda like,

513
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,160
 here's your four steps towards resolving conflict

514
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,840
 with one another, with believers inside of it.

515
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,880
 And so before we go there,

516
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,640
 I'm gonna give you the other thing the scripture says

517
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,920
 as it relates to resolving conflict,

518
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,960
 that you and I are to be people

519
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,000
 who seek to overlook conflict whenever we can.

520
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,120
 That, in other words, the scripture says this

521
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,480
 in Proverbs 19, 11, that how do I know if this is,

522
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,120
 in other words, let me say this.

523
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,820
 Am I to be someone who every time I either get hurt

524
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,900
 or I feel misunderstood, or every time something

525
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,980
 doesn't go how I think it should,

526
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,080
 I'm to pursue that recklessly as though it's a conflict?

527
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,160
 Or every time maybe someone said something

528
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,200
 that impacted me, should I pursue that as a conflict?

529
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,700
 No, not necessarily.

530
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,960
 The Bible says in Proverbs 19, verse 11,

531
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,880
 that a person's wisdom yields patience,

532
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,160
 and it is to one's glory, or it is a glorious thing

533
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,300
 to overlook an offense.

534
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,900
 The Bible says that you and I are to overlook offenses

535
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,820
 whenever we can.

536
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,400
 The truth of the matter, though, is,

537
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 and so we'll talk about what does it mean

538
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,240
 to overlook an offense, and how do I know whenever I can,

539
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,000
 is a lot of us, I think if we were honest,

540
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
 we try to overlook offenses, we try to,

541
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,680
 someone says something mean, and they kinda make a joke

542
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,440
 at us, and they're like, ha ha, man,

543
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,800
 that really hurt me right there.

544
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,280
 I'm not upset, I'm fine, okay, it's great.

545
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,680
 I hate this person, and that's how we walk away.

546
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,680
 And we tell ourself, it's not that big of a deal,

547
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,640
 I'm just gonna go tell all these other people about you

548
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,480
 and how mean you are, and that's what we do,

549
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,760
 and that's not resolving the conflict,

550
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,520
 and it's not looking the other way.

551
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,180
 The Bible says that you and I, when we can,

552
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,620
 should overlook it.

553
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,160
 How do we know if we can?

554
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,560
 If you find yourself replaying a conversation

555
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,600
 with someone over and over and over again,

556
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,440
 it's probably an indicator that you need

557
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,640
 to have a conversation with them.

558
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,180
 In other words, if someone does an action,

559
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,480
 does something that hurts you, says something

560
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,480
 that either you felt was an inaccurate representation

561
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,800
 of you, or undermined you, or hurt your feelings,

562
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,480
 and you find yourself kinda driving down the road,

563
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,920
 replaying the tape, and thinking through

564
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,280
 what you should've said, and how next time

565
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,600
 you're going to, and everyone's gonna point at them

566
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,640
 and laugh, and you find yourself replaying that,

567
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,200
 or you find yourself in the shower,

568
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,880
 just dominating these hypothetical conversations

569
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,880
 in your mind, you probably need to move

570
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,880
 towards that person, to have a conversation.

571
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,740
 If you find yourself, and this is a really common one,

572
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,800
 where anytime you're around them,

573
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,680
 the only thing you can think about

574
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,640
 is whatever incident was there.

575
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,440
 You're just like, yeah, uh-huh, that's great,

576
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,920
 yeah, of course, you need a ride too, well, great, yeah.

577
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,560
 How about you get some friends first, huh?

578
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,800
 Because you told me I didn't have any friends,

579
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,440
 and I'm not your friend, and all you can think about

580
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,620
 is that, and you're not saying it,

581
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,440
 but it's just kinda like, uh-huh.

582
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,280
 You need to have the conversation,

583
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,000
 or anytime that someone brings up their name,

584
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,360
 you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I used to like him too,

585
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,160
 until I started liking great people,

586
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,720
 and then I stopped liking them.

587
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,940
 And so, you need to have the conversation.

588
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,920
 So now, that we've realized that we need

589
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,600
 to have the conversation, if we find ourselves

590
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,480
 just replaying the tape, how do we have that conversation?

591
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,400
 What does it look like to go through, biblically,

592
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,160
 the process of having that conversation?

593
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,200
 With a believer, Jesus makes it really clear.

594
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,080
 We're gonna come back to, and by believer,

595
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,160
 I mean a follower of Jesus.

596
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,520
 Here's what Jesus says, are the four steps,

597
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,360
 according to Jesus, in which you and I

598
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,040
 are people who bring about peace.

599
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,720
 We're not peace fakers, we are peacemakers.

600
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,200
 And we bring about peace by following Jesus' instructions.

601
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,500
 He says this in Matthew chapter 18, verse 15.

602
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:43,280
 If your brother or sister sins,

603
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,520
 whether that's against you, whether it's just in general,

604
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,280
 he's given instructions for the church,

605
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,360
 but if they've sinned, and they sinned against you,

606
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,560
 they hurt you, or a word was said,

607
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,520
 go to them and point out their fault,

608
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,640
 just between the two of you.

609
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,560
 Dude, how would the church change if just this verse

610
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,240
 was embraced and adopted and played out

611
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,460
 all over our country?

612
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,560
 That whenever someone hurts me,

613
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,920
 I'm going to go directly to them.

614
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,860
 If they listen to you, you have won them over.

615
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,960
 So Jesus says, whenever you find yourself

616
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,680
 in a situation where someone's hurt you,

617
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,920
 where someone is in sin, or someone has sinned against you,

618
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,360
 that you and I are to be people who go to them.

619
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,720
 We talk to them, not about them.

620
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,480
 I only talk to people who are either a part of the problem

621
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,000
 or a part of the solution.

622
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,720
 I don't vent, I don't look for things to share

623
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,440
 and kinda let me just bounce stuff off of you

624
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,960
 to justify how I feel in this moment.

625
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,840
 I go directly to that person.

626
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,640
 I share directly with them in private,

627
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,960
 for the hopes not of hurting them or wounding them back,

628
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,080
 for the hopes of winning them back, Jesus says,

629
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,760
 that the body of Christ, and this is a big problem,

630
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,800
 honestly, there are a lot of you in the room

631
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,300
 who are talking about people,

632
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,960
 and you're not talking to people, and it's disgusting,

633
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,520
 and it's an offense to God.

634
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:16,480
 If you ever find yourself talking negatively

635
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,320
 about someone who is not present, you are in sin,

636
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,440
 and you need to stop, and you need to repent,

637
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,000
 and you need to ask for the forgiveness

638
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,040
 from the person who you negatively talked about

639
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,700
 and the person who you negatively talked to

640
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,160
 about the other person.

641
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,520
 You need to say, hey, I need to ask for your forgiveness

642
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,540
 because I was talking badly about Bill,

643
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,220
 or Mshirt, fill in the blank, whatever their name is,

644
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,880
 and I've tainted your perspective on him,

645
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
 and now I wanna go with Bill, and I just wanna say,

646
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,840
 hey, I was talking negatively about you to X person.

647
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,460
 If you were to come to me and you,

648
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,520
 I wanted to share something about JP,

649
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,320
 and how I can't believe it, he's just so big time,

650
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,520
 and I can't believe what he thinks.

651
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,840
 He's just got a big head, literally, and prideful,

652
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,480
 and I'm gonna, have you talked to him about this?

653
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,040
 Here's what I know about JP, he's not a perfect person.

654
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,800
 He knows he's not a perfect person,

655
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,600
 and he wants to know the ways that, man,

656
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,240
 his imperfections have hurt someone, or wounded someone,

657
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,400
 or maybe been misunderstood in ways

658
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,700
 that he could be more effective as a follower of Jesus,

659
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,620
 and so I'm gonna do this,

660
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,540
 you have 24 hours to go talk to him,

661
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,980
 and if you can't reach out in the next 24 hours,

662
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,460
 I'm gonna reach out,

663
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,780
 and I'm gonna tell him what you shared with me,

664
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,540
 and then collectively, we're all gonna get together

665
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,980
 and process through this,

666
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,180
 because this is clearly something

667
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,940
 that's important enough for you to share,

668
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,980
 and then I know if it's at that level,

669
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,420
 it's gonna be important enough for JP,

670
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,580
 he's gonna wanna learn, and know, and grow through it.

671
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,260
 No, dude, don't do that, that's so awkward,

672
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,560
 oh my gosh, don't do that.

673
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,620
 It's what the Bible commands us to do,

674
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,340
 and if you're someone who is having others share with you,

675
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,420
 it's your role to tell them,

676
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,820
 have you shared this with them,

677
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,820
 because you, whenever you don't do that,

678
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,220
 you become a part of the problem,

679
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,220
 you are equally guilty of tolerating gossip,

680
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,740
 and if you're talking bad about people,

681
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,700
 and it is happening in this room,

682
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,200
 it is a sin, talk to people, not about people,

683
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,920
 and Jesus says you go directly to them,

684
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,720
 and here's what you do whenever, this is so huge,

685
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,200
 so if you kinda tuned out for just a second,

686
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
 come all the way back in here,

687
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,500
 stop counting the wood things, right here.

688
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,520
 (congregation laughing)

689
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,900
 Here is how, here's what you do,

690
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,240
 whenever you go right to them, you go to them,

691
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,680
 and you address what's going on,

692
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,280
 here's what you need to do, it's so huge, I promise you,

693
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,880
 this is worth your money, right now,

694
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,080
 I'm about to give you exactly what you're gonna share

695
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,480
 with that person, so tune back in,

696
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,120
 wherever you're listening from.

697
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,840
 You focus on two things, two very specific things,

698
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,140
 whenever I go to them, the person's specific behavior,

699
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,760
 exactly the behavior, and the emotional response

700
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,980
 it created in me, you don't focus on motive,

701
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,980
 you don't focus on character, you're always,

702
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,860
 this is just who you are, you're a bad apple

703
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,760
 in a bad scene, I can't believe you, an unbelievable,

704
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,420
 you always, you don't focus on motive,

705
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,020
 and when you do that, all you,

706
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,920
 you were just trying to make me look bad,

707
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,740
 that's what you were trying to do,

708
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,100
 you don't focus on motive, you focus on

709
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,900
 the specific behavior, and the emotional response

710
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,420
 it created in you, because you don't know motive,

711
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,380
 I don't know motive, we can assume, we can guess,

712
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,500
 we can presume, but as followers of Jesus,

713
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,400
 we're believing the best, here's the specific behavior,

714
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,300
 when you said that about me in front of everyone,

715
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,300
 it made me feel little, it hurt my feelings,

716
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,460
 I share exactly the specific behavior,

717
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,980
 and then the way that, when you told me

718
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,300
 that you were gonna come to that event,

719
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,240
 and then you kinda blew me off,

720
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,580
 or you didn't answer my phone call,

721
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,040
 12 days in a row, or 12 times in a row,

722
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,180
 it made me feel like you don't care about me,

723
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,520
 you focus on the specific behavior,

724
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,660
 and the emotional response that it created within you,

725
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,620
 you stay away from character, you stay away from motive,

726
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,980
 this will save you so much money

727
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,760
 in marriage counseling someday, I can't even tell you,

728
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,820
 if you will be someone who just says,

729
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,580
 this is the specific, I'm not gonna assume

730
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,480
 it's 'cause you disrespect me, 'cause you don't care

731
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,740
 about me, 'cause you're different, we think different,

732
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,260
 we communicate differently, I'm not gonna go

733
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,440
 and attack your character, I'm just gonna say,

734
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,520
 this is the specific behavior,

735
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,540
 and this is the emotional response it created inside of me,

736
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,580
 and Jesus says, you go directly to that person,

737
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,840
 if they don't listen, he says, you go to step two,

738
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,880
 which is this, if they will not listen,

739
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,420
 you take one or two others along,

740
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,720
 so that every matter may be established

741
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,280
 by the testimony of two or three witnesses,

742
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,240
 so Jesus says, you go to that person,

743
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,680
 you share with them either an area

744
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,140
 where you're seeing them live contrary to God's word,

745
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,440
 you're seeing them either sin against you,

746
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,000
 or just you see a sin in their life,

747
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,480
 you love them enough to move in,

748
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,460
 and to discuss that with them,

749
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,520
 and if they don't listen, he says,

750
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,720
 you just widen the circle, bring in another person,

751
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,240
 another follower of Jesus, or maybe two other followers

752
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,760
 of Jesus, ideally, they're objective,

753
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,200
 they're not someone who, if you bring them with you,

754
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,920
 they're gonna be like, great, they're teaming up on me,

755
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,760
 double team, and they're not gonna feel that,

756
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,200
 someone who's objective, who they know cares about 'em,

757
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,840
 and you widen the circle, and you say, look,

758
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,840
 I pointed out with Kevin, that when he said this,

759
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,540
 it hurt me, or this particular behavior in his life,

760
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,020
 I think is inconsistent with God's will,

761
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,780
 he's living contrary to God's word,

762
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,700
 but I may be wrong, will you help us together,

763
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,740
 collectively, work towards whatever God's best would be,

764
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,180
 or what God's word says, and if the person still goes,

765
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,700
 no, talk to the hand, you and God can talk to the hand,

766
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,580
 I'm not listening, then it says,

767
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,360
 you do step three, Jesus says, which is this,

768
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,600
 if they still refuse, tell it to the church,

769
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,960
 now the word church in this time,

770
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,800
 is just the word assembly, ekklesia is a Greek word

771
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,120
 that was here, used, and it just means the gathering,

772
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,760
 the assembly, it's more closely,

773
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,480
 it's closer to a community group,

774
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,280
 if you're a Watermark member, or a small group,

775
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,420
 if you're at another church, it's closer to that,

776
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,720
 than it is up here, it's not like,

777
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,240
 all right, get 'em out here, here we go,

778
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,320
 this guy, you need to know, it's more closely,

779
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,880
 tell it to his community group,

780
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,500
 tell it to the community groups

781
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,340
 that may be represented and involved,

782
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:39,300
 and it says, if they still won't listen to the church,

783
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,760
 then deal on to step four,

784
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,300
 and if they refuse to listen to the church,

785
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,420
 treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector,

786
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,340
 so Jesus goes four steps, go to them individually,

787
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,220
 widen the circle as necessary from there,

788
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,580
 if they still continue to say,

789
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,940
 I don't care what the Bible says,

790
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,700
 then treat them as you would a pagan or tax collector,

791
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,160
 what is a pagan or a tax collector,

792
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,780
 and how, what does that mean?

793
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,640
 A pagan was essentially someone

794
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,200
 who just had no relationship with God,

795
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,580
 he may have believed in the gods,

796
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,360
 but was not a follower of Christ,

797
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,100
 same with a tax collector,

798
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,220
 and Jesus says, that's the type of way

799
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,060
 you're gonna now treat them,

800
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,020
 now how did Jesus, this is really important,

801
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,320
 how did Jesus treat pagans and tax collectors?

802
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,700
 Like, did Jesus just say, hey, if they still won't listen,

803
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,860
 then write 'em off, and blog about 'em,

804
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,780
 and talk mean about 'em on Facebook, no,

805
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,420
 Jesus loved pagans and tax collectors,

806
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,300
 he spent time with them, he invested in them,

807
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,140
 he loved them, what is your response,

808
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,220
 and my response if someone says,

809
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,740
 look, I'm just continuing,

810
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,900
 I don't care what the Bible says about marriage,

811
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,560
 I don't care what it says about premarital sex,

812
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,880
 I don't care what it says about life,

813
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,140
 I don't care what it says about alcohol,

814
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,220
 I don't care what it says about money,

815
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,460
 I don't care about that stuff,

816
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,540
 then you know how to treat that person

817
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,400
 as a pagan and tax collector,

818
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,460
 Jesus loved the pagan and tax collector,

819
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,300
 he didn't write them out of their life,

820
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,200
 he didn't hold them to the same standard

821
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,780
 that he held followers of Christ to,

822
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,100
 in other words, followers of Christ said, follow me,

823
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,380
 to those who didn't share those values,

824
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,320
 didn't hold 'em that standard,

825
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,580
 but he still loved those people,

826
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,380
 so you and I are to do with those in our life

827
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,740
 who continue to say, I don't care what God's word says,

828
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,420
 you don't write them off, you love them,

829
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,860
 like Jesus commanded us to,

830
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,060
 and you don't hold them to the same standards

831
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,500
 that you hold followers of Christ to,

832
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
 so he indicates that there is a difference

833
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,120
 in the way that we treat a person,

834
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,840
 the way that we resolve relationships or conflicts,

835
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,180
 based on whether or not they are a follower of Christ,

836
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,800
 and so now I'm gonna finish up

837
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,240
 with just a little bit of driving this home

838
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,120
 to make it super practical,

839
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,720
 as we talk through how do we resolve conflicts,

840
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,480
 depending on if they are a believer or a non-believer,

841
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,180
 inside of our world and inside of our life,

842
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,720
 these are giant dice,

843
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,320
 and they were made by an amazing member of our team,

844
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,280
 and they will kinda lay out

845
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,600
 some of the four different arenas

846
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,480
 where most of us have conflict in life,

847
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,480
 our family, our work, our dating relationships,

848
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,720
 and our friends, these are the four primary places

849
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,620
 that you and I are gonna have conflict,

850
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,400
 and they're usually gonna be with people,

851
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,800
 no, they're always gonna be with people

852
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,800
 who are either Christians or exes, non-Christians,

853
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,000
 and I don't know how else to convey that,

854
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,440
 and so let's talk about it, let's set up a scenario

855
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
 where hey, is a person, all right, great,

856
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,760
 so they are a non-believer,

857
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,800
 and they are a dating relationship,

858
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,160
 okay, you shouldn't be dating a non-believer,

859
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
 (audience laughing)

860
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,200
 so we're gonna roll the dice again,

861
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,040
 they're a family member who is not a follower of Jesus,

862
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,480
 so maybe you have a sibling,

863
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,360
 true story, you should not date someone

864
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,080
 who's not following Christ,

865
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,160
 there's a lot of messages that we've done on that,

866
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,080
 and 2 Corinthians 6, 14 says you and I

867
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,400
 are not to be unequally yoked,

868
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,120
 if you want a recipe to have maximum conflict

869
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,440
 in your life and marriage, you should marry someone

870
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,160
 who doesn't have Jesus as the most important person

871
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,120
 in their life, so before we cover that,

872
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,520
 and go into the family, now, onto family,

873
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,360
 family, let's say that you have a sibling

874
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,600
 who's not a believer, you have a parent

875
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,920
 who's not a believer, what is you and I's role

876
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,340
 as it relates to resolving conflict?

877
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,480
 Maybe they've heard us by the tone that they've used,

878
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,680
 by the actions they've taken, by the manipulative patterns

879
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,440
 and the passive aggressive language that they use,

880
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,560
 what is you and I's role as it relates

881
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,920
 to resolving conflict with a sibling who's not a believer,

882
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,320
 or a parent who's not a believer?

883
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,640
 Maybe it's a sibling who's not a believer,

884
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,720
 you and I have the same role every single time,

885
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,280
 that you and I are to own our part in every conversation,

886
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,840
 anytime we can own our part, I'm gonna own my part,

887
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,800
 I wanna own anything I can,

888
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,720
 I could've communicated better,

889
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,800
 I could've been a better sibling,

890
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,880
 I wanna own any of the ways that I was less

891
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,520
 than God's best to you, brother or sister,

892
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,840
 true family member, by that I mean a family member,

893
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,080
 I wanna own anything that I can,

894
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,920
 and then, they're not a believer, I'm gonna extend grace.

895
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,560
 If they're not a believer and they act like

896
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,880
 they're not a believer, they're just fulfilling

897
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,440
 their job description, I'm not gonna hold them

898
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
 and be like, man, you should've been a lot kinder

899
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,340
 and more like Jesus, no, they're not a follower of Christ,

900
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,240
 and so I'm gonna own my part, I'm gonna extend grace,

901
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,000
 and I'm gonna seek to model Christ to that person.

902
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,100
 What if they are a friend who is a believer?

903
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,300
 If they're a friend who's hurt me in some way,

904
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,520
 I'm gonna go to that person,

905
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,160
 and I'm gonna follow Jesus' four steps,

906
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,260
 I'm gonna identify the specific behavior,

907
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,500
 and how it made me feel, to them individually, privately,

908
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,380
 and if they won't listen and they reject that,

909
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,100
 then I'm gonna widen the circle as necessary.

910
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,100
 What if they are a non-believer at work?

911
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,720
 I'm gonna do the same thing.

912
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,600
 If a coworker's rude to me, maybe my boss is like,

913
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,680
 drops the F-bomb and I can't believe you,

914
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,340
 and you're terrible, what am I gonna do?

915
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,400
 I'm gonna own whatever I can.

916
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,620
 I should've had that reporting quicker.

917
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,960
 Will you please forgive me?

918
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,920
 How can I continue to grow and be a better employee?

919
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,760
 I'm gonna own whatever I can.

920
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,180
 I'm gonna extend grace.

921
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,560
 Not that there's never a time for you to help a leader

922
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,240
 that may be a non-believer,

923
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,400
 or a coworker that's a non-believer,

924
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,220
 over you, grow in their ability to communicate,

925
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,720
 but by and large, I'm gonna assume,

926
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,160
 man, I'm gonna own my part, I'm gonna extend grace to them,

927
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,680
 and I'm gonna seek to show the love of Christ

928
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,720
 to that person inside of that workplace.

929
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,760
 Over and over, the scripture commands

930
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,040
 this is what you and I are to do.

931
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,440
 You don't have to stay in violent or workplaces

932
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,100
 that are leading you directly into sin,

933
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,560
 but you and I, as it relates to a work relationship,

934
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,520
 or a coworker that is not a believer,

935
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,600
 I own my part, if I can own anything,

936
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,580
 and I extend grace, and I show them the love

937
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,040
 that Christ showed to me,

938
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,920
 in hopes that maybe God's gonna reach out,

939
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,360
 and through our relationship,

940
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,020
 invite 'em into a relationship with their Savior.

941
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,600
 What about if they're in a dating relationship,

942
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,500
 and they are a believer?

943
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,160
 That's probably a crucial one to talk about.

944
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,200
 What if they're dating someone, and they are a believer?

945
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,560
 What does it look like to work through Matthew 18?

946
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,360
 Depending on the relationship, and the hurt that's involved,

947
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,160
 it wouldn't be inappropriate to go there,

948
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,080
 depending on the relationship, and the hurt that's involved,

949
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,600
 to go and to ask for forgiveness,

950
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,480
 to own whatever part that you can,

951
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,620
 and to seek as best you can to leave that person

952
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,920
 better than you found them,

953
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,720
 to own the ways that you could've led them better,

954
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,220
 or brought more clarity to the relationship,

955
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,460
 to own the ways that you allowed insecurity,

956
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:58,960
 to govern, or to be the leader of your actions,

957
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,180
 more than the Spirit of God,

958
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,180
 or more than the faith that you hold to,

959
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,980
 that there's times that, man,

960
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,740
 it's totally appropriate and in balance,

961
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,580
 and here's what's big.

962
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,300
 Here's why, if you date a nonbeliever,

963
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,100
 you're gonna be set up for a lot of pain.

964
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,560
 The pain that comes from dating,

965
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,540
 or the conflicts that come from dating

966
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,700
 someone who's not following Jesus,

967
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,360
 are infinitely worse than the conflicts

968
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,800
 that are gonna come from someone who is.

969
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,420
 I mean, truly, not just, hey, I'm a Christian,

970
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,260
 I'm at the porch.

971
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,920
 Lot of non-followers of Jesus

972
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,380
 that attend the porch every week.

973
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,740
 I mean, actually following Christ.

974
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,160
 By and large, if you're dating someone,

975
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,580
 the two of you are following Christ,

976
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,420
 you're not gonna be like,

977
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,940
 I can't believe you cheated on me,

978
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,780
 and he slept with her, 'cause he's not sleeping with you.

979
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,460
 He's someone who holds the idea of sexuality and sex

980
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,580
 as something that God gave

981
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,900
 as an incredible gift towards marriage.

982
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,940
 So a lot of the pain and the heartache and the conflict

983
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:50,540
 and just the dysfunction of our dating relationships,

984
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,980
 you will be protected from if you are consistent

985
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,860
 to date someone who is following Jesus

986
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,980
 with the life that they live.

987
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,700
 And every conflict, you and I, as a wrap-up,

988
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,460
 have a perspective to have, it is not a bad thing.

989
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,420
 It is an opportunity,

990
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,020
 and one of the greatest opportunities that we have

991
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,900
 to honor Christ.

992
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,620
 You and I have a part to own.

993
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,140
 We always have a part to own.

994
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:19,120
 And finally, you and I have a path towards peace

995
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,580
 that Christ has given us.

996
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,420
 Let me close with this.

997
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,740
 This is why this is such a big deal to God.

998
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,700
 The Bible talks about conflict over and over and over again.

999
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,060
 In Romans chapter 12, Ephesians chapter four,

1000
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,040
 I mean, over and over and over again,

1001
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,460
 almost like every book in the New Testament,

1002
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,380
 it's like, man, you guys are gonna be diligent

1003
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,540
 to preserve the unity of the Spirit

1004
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,700
 and keep one another close in relationship.

1005
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,440
 Why is God so passionate about relationships being healed?

1006
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,740
 Because the whole message of the Bible

1007
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,020
 is about a relationship being healed.

1008
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,980
 The message of the gospel, the good news of Jesus,

1009
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,460
 and the good news of really the New Testament

1010
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,380
 and the Bible in general is that you and I

1011
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,020
 were in conflict with God.

1012
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,560
 You and I were, what the Bible says, children of wrath,

1013
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,620
 because of the sinful decisions that you and I have made,

1014
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,700
 because the decisions in your life that you've made,

1015
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,460
 you're ashamed of, nobody even knows about.

1016
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,820
 Because of the decisions that you look back

1017
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,780
 and you're just filled with embarrassment and regret,

1018
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,100
 and I can't believe that I did that,

1019
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,300
 because of the decisions that you made this past weekend,

1020
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,300
 because of any sinful action that you and I take,

1021
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,420
 we were in conflict with God.

1022
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,500
 We were by birth and by choice enemies of God.

1023
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,440
 And what did God do?

1024
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,660
 What did the heart of God move him to do?

1025
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,540
 The Bible says in Romans chapter five, verse eight,

1026
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,760
 that God demonstrates his love for this

1027
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,260
 while we were still in conflict.

1028
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,720
 While we had nothing and wanted nothing to do with God,

1029
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,460
 while we were enemies of God,

1030
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,060
 Jesus died for us and demonstrated God's love for us.

1031
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,740
 Why is God passionate about relationships being reconciled?

1032
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,500
 That's the point of the Bible,

1033
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,340
 is that all of us had this broken relationship

1034
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,780
 and God said, I will lay down even my life

1035
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,220
 to restore that relationship,

1036
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,520
 to bring that healing involved to that relationship.

1037
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,640
 And now as the people of God who have peace with God,

1038
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,900
 we go about and we introduce peace into the world around us

1039
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,340
 and we say that not only can you have peace

1040
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,820
 with one another, you can have peace with the God

1041
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,760
 who's there, who would lay down even his life

1042
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,600
 for his enemies.

1043
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,500
 I mean, think about that.

1044
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,960
 Jesus gave this radical ethic of love,

1045
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,460
 like love like our world has never seen.

1046
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,260
 I know our world thinks they know what love is all about.

1047
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,700
 They have no idea.

1048
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,460
 They think love is let me do whatever I want,

1049
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,300
 whenever I want.

1050
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,120
 That's not loving.

1051
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,740
 Jesus introduces this radical love that says,

1052
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,820
 I am willing to sacrifice whatever it takes

1053
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,220
 for your good, for your benefit, even my own life.

1054
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,060
 And I will lay down, not for my friends

1055
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,540
 and not for people who try really hard and do good things.

1056
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,840
 The Bible says that when you could do nothing,

1057
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,300
 he ran towards you and laid his life down.

1058
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,100
 He's a God of such great love, he dies for his enemies.

1059
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,140
 Think about that.

1060
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,000
 What type of love dies for their enemies?

1061
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,300
 We live in a world that's so fractured right now

1062
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,820
 in every single direction, racist, racially, politically,

1063
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,100
 sexually or sex, genders, and all these different things,

1064
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,540
 all these different, everyone's looking to fight.

1065
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,500
 And God says, look, I'm not here to take sides,

1066
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,340
 I'm here to take over this world.

1067
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,740
 And I gave my own life so that anyone wants,

1068
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,440
 anyone who wants to know the God who was there

1069
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,420
 can step into a relationship with me

1070
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,660
 and I will bring about healing

1071
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,180
 and they will become an agent of peace inside of this world.

1072
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,780
 There is no other message in all of our world

1073
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,960
 like the message that Jesus brings.

1074
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,500
 There's no words inside of the book of the Quran

1075
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,980
 of this picture of a God

1076
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,900
 who's willing to even die for his enemies.

1077
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,020
 Think about that.

1078
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,660
 American soldiers lay down their lives

1079
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,900
 and say, we will die for ISIS.

1080
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,980
 That's crazy.

1081
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,700
 And yet that's the picture inside of the Bible.

1082
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,080
 That's the picture of the God who's there.

1083
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,780
 That's the picture that our God is passionate

1084
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,480
 about you and I experiencing.

1085
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,760
 And when we begin to know and focus on him,

1086
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,040
 all of a sudden the conflicts,

1087
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,180
 all of a sudden the ways that we were the victim

1088
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,540
 and they hurt us and they did this to me,

1089
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,540
 all of a sudden that shrinks compared to what God,

1090
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,040
 after everything I did to him,

1091
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,440
 was willing to do for me.

1092
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,960
 If you've never had a moment where you have accepted

1093
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,500
 the God who's there,

1094
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:20,500
 the God unlike any other religion,

1095
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,400
 the one true God who despite the fact

1096
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,260
 that you as nice as you are are an enemy,

1097
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:35,400
 unless you've accepted what he did on the cross

1098
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,440
 and dying in your place and rising from the dead,

1099
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,600
 tonight is your night.

1100
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,040
 And he's so crazy about you having a restored relationship,

1101
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,840
 not just with family and friends and dating and work people,

1102
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,920
 but with him that he's already proven,

1103
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,700
 I will go to any length necessary.

1104
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,240
 Does our world need more peace or what?

1105
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,060
 Unlike any time I've ever seen,

1106
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:03,120
 everyone is interested in just,

1107
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,100
 you're the problem, you're the problem, you're the problem.

1108
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,300
 And the body of Christ is quick to say,

1109
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,860
 whenever they're at fault,

1110
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,540
 here was the problem that I introduced and it was wrong.

1111
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,640
 You can own whatever part you want or not.

1112
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,480
 You don't need to.

1113
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,660
 I'm not even gonna make that a part of the deal.

1114
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,260
 I want to make sure I own mine.

1115
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,180
 Because the God who's there,

1116
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:26,140
 despite the fact that he did nothing wrong,

1117
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,300
 would give his life for me.

1118
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,760
 And now I get to bring peace about that shows

1119
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,800
 I'm one of his children.

1120
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,760
 I'm a peacemaker.

1121
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,520
 Let me pray.

1122
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:47,800
 I'm gonna do this.

1123
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,800
 I'm gonna give us just a moment to pray wherever you are.

1124
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,520
 And I just want you to pray for the relationships

1125
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,360
 inside of your life where you know you need to take action.

1126
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:05,360
 I want you to pray for clarity to see your part.

1127
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:12,040
 And then I want you to pray for the body of Christ

1128
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,960
 inside of our country,

1129
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,200
 inside of everything that's going on in our world.

1130
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,280
 Inside of our country, inside of everything that's going on

1131
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,080
 and all the noise and all the yelling

1132
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,640
 that we would say, God, start with us.

1133
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:29,180
 Would you help us to be your people, us to bring the peace?

1134
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,360
 78% of America claims to be Christian.

1135
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,160
 What would happen if 78% of the people in our country

1136
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,720
 began to say, I'm gonna be a person who brings about peace?

1137
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,800
 And so I'm gonna give you a minute to pray

1138
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,840
 wherever you are for yourself,

1139
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,640
 for the relational conflict that you have,

1140
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,080
 and then for the body of Christ in general.

1141
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,840
 And then I'm gonna close this out

1142
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,400
 and then we'll go into worship.

1143
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,980
 (gentle music)

1144
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,560
 (gentle music)

1145
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,140
 (gentle music)

1146
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,720
 (gentle music)

1147
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,300
 (gentle music)

1148
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,880
 (gentle music)

1149
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,460
 (gentle music)

1150
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,040
 (gentle music)

1151
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,180
 Father, would you help us to be peacemakers?

1152
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:48,420
 Would you help us to resemble more the Prince of Peace,

1153
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,860
 your Son, Jesus?

1154
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,600
 I pray for just the relationships inside of this room

1155
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,780
 where people know that they need to own their part.

1156
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,300
 They've been talking bad about people.

1157
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,660
 They've been unwilling to move in the direction

1158
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,820
 of reconciling with people.

1159
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,540
 They've burned bridges behind them.

1160
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,180
 Would you help us to be a person who brings about peace?

1161
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,180
 Would you help us to be a person who brings about peace?

1162
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,180
 Would you help us to be a person who brings about peace?

1163
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,180
 Would you help us to be a person who brings about peace?

1164
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,180
 Would you help us to be a person who brings about peace?

1165
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,180
 Would you help us to be a person who brings about peace?

1166
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,180
 Would you help us to be a person who brings about peace?

1167
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,180
 Would you help us to be a person who brings about peace?

1168
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,180
 Would you help us to be a person who brings about peace?

1169
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,180
 Start with us.

1170
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,180
 Start with me.

1171
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:42,180
 Make us your agents of peace.

1172
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,180
 In the name of the Prince of Peace, we pray.

1173
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,180
 Amen.
