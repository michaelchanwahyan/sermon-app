1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
 - Well, what's up porch?

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,000
 It's great to see you tonight.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,960
 I normally get to spend my Tuesday nights

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,640
 in Fort Worth, Texas,

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,860
 but I'm so excited to get to hang with you tonight

6
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,700
 here in Dallas.

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,760
 Hey, Houston, El Paso, Tulsa,

8
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,720
 everybody else under the sun that's tuning in

9
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,600
 or under the moon since the days are getting shorter.

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,760
 It's great to see everyone tonight.

11
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,440
 Hey, we're gonna take a pause

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,240
 from our series First Comes Love.

13
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,720
 No big deal, it's gonna come back next week.

14
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,640
 But as we do, I wanna start by sharing with you

15
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,280
 that I went on my first fishing trip ever this last weekend.

16
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,200
 Now, I grew up in small town.

17
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,240
 Yes, way to go all seven of you who like to fish.

18
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,560
 Well done.

19
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
 This is your night, man.

20
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,680
 So I went on my first fishing trip ever.

21
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,680
 Now, I grew up in Deep East, Texas, like small town.

22
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,000
 And I don't know what to tell you.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,560
 Man, so I don't know what to tell,

24
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,820
 where two or three are gathered, all right?

25
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,280
 So I don't know what to tell you besides,

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,680
 the apple fell far from the tree, man.

27
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,520
 I just don't fish.

28
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,040
 My dad was a business guy and he coached baseball.

29
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,860
 That was what we did.

30
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,720
 So we were always at the ball field.

31
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,540
 We were never at the fishing pond.

32
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,680
 And so, or river, or lake, or whatever it is.

33
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,240
 And so, what happened was, I told,

34
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,400
 these guys were like, hey,

35
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,600
 there's 12 guys on the Fort Worth team.

36
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,560
 And he said, hey, we're gonna go do this.

37
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,400
 I said, okay, great.

38
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,220
 But you need to understand,

39
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,480
 I'm like basically a nine-year-old.

40
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,160
 I mean, I have no idea what to do.

41
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,720
 I'm gonna need some serious expertise.

42
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,680
 I don't know what to buy.

43
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,160
 I don't know anything for fishing.

44
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,600
 I got my hands, like that's what I got.

45
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,900
 And so, when you guys, and they're like,

46
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,320
 yes, we'll take care of you start to finish.

47
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,640
 So we go through the store, we go to Academy.

48
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
 There's a section for this.

49
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,200
 Some of you knew, but some of you didn't.

50
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,040
 Huge section.

51
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,240
 They're like, and there's these little bags for days.

52
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,000
 It's like half an acre of this stuff.

53
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,120
 And they're walking by and they start speaking

54
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,600
 another language and a strong accent.

55
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,000
 It's like, yeah, we need to get them a little bit

56
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,920
 of blah, blah, blah, and we need to get them

57
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,120
 some of this and a little of this.

58
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,960
 And they start handing me like all this stuff.

59
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,200
 And I'm like, yeah, blah, blah, blah,

60
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,040
 that's what I need.

61
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,120
 And so, they start putting all this stuff in my arms.

62
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,040
 I go and check out and we get to the river.

63
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,720
 Now, you need to understand, this is way back country,

64
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,320
 three days of not seeing another human soul

65
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,800
 except our group, and we are going to fish.

66
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,520
 So I'm loaded up in my kayak and we're gonna go

67
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,600
 and I'm ready.

68
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,880
 And there was a delightful redneck

69
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,160
 who took us to the spot to put in.

70
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,360
 It was amazing.

71
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,640
 And so, he put us in, all the kayaks go in,

72
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,760
 all 12 at once.

73
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,000
 And I start paddling.

74
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,320
 I'm like, I wanna get to the good water.

75
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,480
 I mean, I wanna get where no man has gone lately.

76
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,160
 I mean, I wanna fish, I wanna pioneer this thing,

77
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
 tip of the spear.

78
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,920
 And so, I go and start paddling as soon as I can

79
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,120
 to kind of put some distance between me

80
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,600
 and the rest of the guys.

81
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,160
 And I threw, it makes a very satisfying little,

82
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,640
 when you know when you cast it out there.

83
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,600
 And so, it hits the water and I sat there and grew a beard.

84
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,000
 I mean, nothing happened.

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,240
 And I know what some of you are thinking.

86
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,880
 You're like, oh, did you switch bait?

87
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,200
 Maybe you had the bait, you're supposed to move it.

88
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,480
 Yes, I had five or six different kinds of bait.

89
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,840
 I spent half of the next three days changing the bait.

90
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,160
 I did it near the bank.

91
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,280
 I cast it in the middle of the river.

92
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,920
 I put it on the bottom of the river.

93
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,880
 I put it near the top, kind of floating bait.

94
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,720
 I tried all kinds of bait.

95
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,480
 I had red bait, white bait, blue bait.

96
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,440
 I had all kinds of bait.

97
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,040
 And so, I'm just gonna save you an email.

98
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,440
 If you come down here after the message

99
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,080
 and you're like, hey man, I know what you did wrong.

100
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
 We are going to fight.

101
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,200
 I do not wanna hear,

102
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
 because I'm telling you,

103
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,720
 everybody knows the answer to the problem.

104
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,120
 And so, I'm just telling you, it was a rough weekend.

105
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,080
 At one point, I didn't catch any fish the whole day.

106
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,840
 I bet I casted 500 times, no fish,

107
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,400
 and this place is supposed to be an easy place

108
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
 to catch fish.

109
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
 And so, by the end of the second night,

110
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,360
 one of the guys,

111
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,280
 one of the guys who had taken me through the store

112
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,840
 came up to me, said, Garrett, do you wanna catch a fish?

113
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,120
 And I said, yes, I want to catch fish.

114
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,360
 And so, he said, come on.

115
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,000
 And so, we go down to the river.

116
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
 It is nighttime.

117
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,440
 He's got a headlamp on, okay?

118
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,120
 We're like to see, okay?

119
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,200
 People do this at night.

120
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,240
 And so, he's got a headlamp on,

121
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,840
 and we go down to his kayak,

122
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,160
 where he has got Academy Sports and Outdoors in his kayak,

123
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,800
 where he can give me anything that I need.

124
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,240
 And he starts rigging up,

125
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,960
 and he does the other language thing again.

126
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,800
 He's like, yeah, you need a little,

127
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,960
 you know, a little this, a little that.

128
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,040
 And then he pauses, and he goes,

129
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,760
 this is how you fish with kids, by the way.

130
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,880
 I'm like, oh, that's very encouraging.

131
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,720
 Thank you.

132
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,620
 And so, he starts rigging me up this deal,

133
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,280
 and he says, all right, go out there.

134
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,280
 And so, I walk out there into the leg-high water.

135
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
 It's nighttime.

136
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,940
 I'm like, the joke is on me.

137
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,780
 Are you kidding?

138
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,460
 I walk out there with his headlamp, and he goes,

139
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,500
 oh yeah, this ain't gonna take long.

140
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,340
 Chunk him out there.

141
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,460
 I'm like, yeah, sure, I'm not gonna, it's kind of,

142
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,420
 so boom, threw it out there, and grew my second beard.

143
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,280
 And nothing happened.

144
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,220
 It just sat there the whole time.

145
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,140
 It just sits there.

146
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,060
 Nothing happened the entire weekend.

147
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,140
 And so, here's what I wanna tell you about fishing.

148
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,300
 Fishing is actually waiting.

149
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,900
 Fishing is waiting and wondering what the fish want.

150
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,940
 'Cause you don't know.

151
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,200
 And at first, you don't really wonder what the fish want,

152
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,840
 because that's what insane people do.

153
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,760
 You don't wanna sit there and think,

154
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
 what do you want, fish?

155
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,020
 Instead, you just wanna fish.

156
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,860
 But eventually, your patience starts to get worn down,

157
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,780
 and you're like, what do you want?

158
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,620
 What do you want from me?

159
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,180
 Do you want it closer to the surface?

160
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,220
 Do you want it farther down?

161
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,420
 What is it exactly that you want?

162
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,260
 I mean, are you guys down there like,

163
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,260
 ah, it's Garrett's hook, ha ha, you know what I mean?

164
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,420
 What are you guys doing down there?

165
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,740
 Before you know it, I start to get vengeful.

166
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,420
 I walk through the grocery store, you know,

167
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,260
 and there's the fish right there,

168
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,860
 and I'm like, ha ha, you know?

169
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,900
 (congregation laughing)

170
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,300
 We win, we win.

171
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,540
 I cook you and eat you.

172
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,460
 And so, before you know it,

173
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,260
 you start asking yourself all these insane questions,

174
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,240
 and you realize that fishing is waiting

175
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,020
 and wondering what the fish want.

176
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,320
 And there's something else in life

177
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,240
 that involves a lot of waiting and wondering.

178
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,720
 And it is, that something else

179
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,280
 that involves a lot of waiting and wondering

180
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,280
 is a relationship with someone you can't see, namely God.

181
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,680
 When you're in a relationship with God,

182
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,280
 you are in a relationship with someone that you cannot see

183
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,520
 and someone that you cannot control,

184
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,160
 which many of you have noticed.

185
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,660
 You don't get to say what God does.

186
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,140
 You don't get to decide what God does.

187
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,300
 He gets to decide.

188
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
 And at first, no matter how patiently,

189
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,660
 you know, and you focus on it,

190
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,460
 just like I did with fishing, you know, you focus on it.

191
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,580
 You're like, okay, this time,

192
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,980
 I'm gonna get the right study Bible,

193
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,540
 and I'm gonna get the right journal and pen,

194
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,740
 and I'm gonna get the right mentors,

195
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,820
 I'm gonna get the right coaching,

196
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,940
 and I am just going to be very, very patient.

197
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,020
 But eventually, your patience wears down,

198
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,740
 and you're left wondering the same kinds of questions.

199
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,980
 What does God want?

200
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,020
 Eventually, you start going, okay, what do you want?

201
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,860
 What do you want?

202
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,680
 Is it me?

203
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
 I mean, is something wrong with me?

204
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,940
 Is it 'cause I haven't read my Bible enough lately?

205
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,260
 Is that why you're not doing what I want?

206
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,620
 It seems like you're jumping around,

207
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,820
 which by the way, on the trip,

208
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,740
 fish were jumping around me, just not on the hook.

209
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,540
 And it seems like, I mean, and you walk with God,

210
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,380
 you're going, okay, God,

211
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,280
 it seems like you're doing good things for other people,

212
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,560
 but I'm just waiting on you,

213
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,520
 waiting for a better circumstance,

214
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,220
 waiting for a better job,

215
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,300
 waiting for someone who is able to be convinced

216
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,560
 to spend the rest of their life with me.

217
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,440
 I'm waiting on a parent to be healed.

218
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,800
 I'm waiting on me to be healed.

219
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
 I'm waiting on a promotion.

220
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,640
 I'm waiting on you to get me out of this financial ordeal.

221
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,840
 And we wait and we wait and we wait.

222
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,300
 And eventually, you just start wondering,

223
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,480
 man, what's wrong with me?

224
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,600
 Is it because I pay more attention

225
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,820
 to fantasy football this week?

226
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,260
 Is it 'cause I signed up for Bumble?

227
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,440
 I mean, what's the deal?

228
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,480
 God, is there something actually wrong with me?

229
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,020
 We wait and we wonder.

230
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,580
 And if you're not careful, you end up getting frustrated.

231
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,620
 And so what I wanna do tonight

232
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,120
 is I want you to see in the scripture

233
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,000
 with complete clarity what God wants.

234
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,320
 That's what we're gonna spend our time on tonight,

235
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,640
 is what God wants.

236
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,240
 Because in the scripture, God gets to speak for himself.

237
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,440
 And so we can go straight to him

238
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,400
 to hear exactly what he wants.

239
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,520
 And so what we're gonna do

240
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,560
 is we're gonna go to a parable that Jesus told.

241
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,440
 Now, what's a parable?

242
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,520
 A parable is a short story

243
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,720
 that Jesus told to illustrate one point.

244
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,240
 All right, it's a short made-up story

245
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,760
 that Jesus made up in order to illustrate

246
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
 something very important about God.

247
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,560
 And in this story, which is found in Luke chapter 15,

248
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,880
 you're gonna see that Jesus illustrates what God wants.

249
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,280
 And specifically, you're gonna get introduced

250
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
 to a few people in this story,

251
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,560
 and you're gonna need to pay attention to them.

252
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,720
 And so the three are, one, you're gonna meet a father

253
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,600
 who has two sons, and those two sons

254
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,240
 are the second and third characters in the story.

255
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,160
 And now Luke is the third book of your New Testament.

256
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,220
 So Matthew, Mark, Luke.

257
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,280
 Luke is essentially a biography of Jesus.

258
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,360
 And just to give you confidence,

259
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,840
 and to give me confidence tonight,

260
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,440
 that Luke is a trustworthy source,

261
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,720
 the more archeological discoveries that are made,

262
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
 the more time goes on.

263
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,400
 Luke has proven himself over and over again

264
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,200
 to be one of the most reliable historians ever.

265
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,840
 The book of Acts, he also wrote it,

266
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,500
 which is, if you're tracking with us on Sundays

267
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,120
 here at Watermark, the book of Acts was written by Luke,

268
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
 and he has incredible eye for detail.

269
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,320
 The scripture says that he was a physician.

270
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,920
 And so if you're a medical type,

271
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,120
 you know that detail is important.

272
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,680
 And Luke is going to capture in detail

273
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
 exactly what Jesus wanted to express to us

274
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,000
 about what God wants.

275
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,280
 You'll see three acts as we go.

276
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,120
 The story develops.

277
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
 That's the fun part about a story,

278
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,920
 is there's some tension and some development to it.

279
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,120
 And so there are three acts in that story,

280
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,920
 and we're gonna pause after each one

281
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,880
 and draw attention to it.

282
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,080
 And so let's get to the text.

283
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,360
 This is a very famous story, by the way.

284
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,840
 Some of you have heard this before,

285
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,920
 and some of you are gonna get to enjoy this

286
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,880
 for the first time.

287
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,480
 Luke 15, verse 11.

288
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,780
 Jesus said, "There was a man who had two sons,

289
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,560
 "and the younger of them said to his father,

290
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,840
 "Father, give me the share of property

291
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,720
 "that is coming to me."

292
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,200
 And he divided his property between them.

293
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,720
 You should know up front, the father represents God.

294
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,640
 And this younger son comes up to him and says,

295
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,800
 "Father, give me the share of property

296
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,640
 "that is coming to me."

297
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,420
 What he's doing is he's doing a big no-no.

298
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,760
 You need to know how offensive this is.

299
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,680
 He is asking for his inheritance early.

300
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,020
 He's going to his dad and he's saying,

301
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,200
 "Hey, I know how this works.

302
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
 "When you die, I get money.

303
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,680
 "And so can we just pretend that's already happened?

304
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,620
 "You be dead to me.

305
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,580
 "I'm gonna remove myself from this house.

306
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,120
 "You're not my dad functionally anymore for sure.

307
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,360
 "And I would love to take the wealth

308
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,600
 "that you have accrued through your hard work,

309
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,480
 "and I would like to go and do whatever I want with it."

310
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,360
 And so this breaks any father's heart.

311
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,720
 No dad wants to hear this.

312
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,160
 No good dad wants to hear this.

313
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,240
 And this is exactly what he does.

314
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,800
 He used his father to get what he really wanted

315
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,580
 'cause he didn't want his father.

316
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,480
 This is heartbreaking for anyone.

317
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,880
 And so the first act kind of unfolds quickly.

318
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,120
 It's worth knowing that God wants you to want him

319
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,380
 more than what he can give you.

320
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,640
 God wants you to want him.

321
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,840
 If he's a father, and the father in the story

322
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,240
 represents God the father.

323
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,480
 And if he's a loving father, then he wants you,

324
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,800
 if he's in it for the relationship,

325
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,220
 then any father who's really in it for the relationship

326
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,400
 doesn't just wanna provide, he wants to have relationship.

327
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,640
 And I'm sad to say that this is where we get

328
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,840
 to see ourselves in the story,

329
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,520
 which is why the story is so gripping.

330
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,440
 Because every one of us to some degree or another,

331
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,600
 self-included, have made this deal with God.

332
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,440
 I'm sad to say that I made this deal with God.

333
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,280
 I didn't say it in these terms.

334
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,760
 I don't even think I said it consciously, but I knew.

335
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,600
 See, I grew up in church.

336
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
 I was churched a little bit at least.

337
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,680
 And I knew what was right, I knew what was wrong.

338
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,880
 And I knew, I had heard of the goodness of God.

339
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,300
 And I said, I think I know what is good,

340
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,140
 and I'm gonna go get it.

341
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,080
 So I essentially in my heart said to God,

342
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,340
 God, I don't want you, I'll just go have sex

343
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,480
 with your daughters, whoever I want.

344
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,520
 God, I don't want you, but your food is pretty good.

345
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,880
 God, I don't want you, but I'd love to have a lot

346
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,680
 of your creation so that I can be rich

347
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,320
 and I can feel like I'm managing a lot.

348
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,480
 God, I don't wanna worship you, I wanna worship,

349
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,240
 but I like it when your people worship me.

350
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,440
 Every one of us have made this deal with God.

351
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
 And no father wants it and God does not want it.

352
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,360
 He wants us to want him more than what he can offer us

353
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,700
 because he's in it for the relationship.

354
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,800
 But here's the thing, he won't force it.

355
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,280
 God didn't keep any prisoners.

356
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,560
 The door is wide open and this kid took it.

357
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,640
 And so it says in verse 13, not many days later,

358
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,940
 the younger son did what sons do

359
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,860
 when they got daddy's money,

360
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,640
 but they don't care about daddy's wishes.

361
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,260
 It says he gathered all he had

362
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,720
 and he took a journey into a far country.

363
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,140
 And there he squandered his property in reckless living.

364
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,360
 Now we find out later in the story

365
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,080
 that he didn't kind of party.

366
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,400
 When you see reckless living,

367
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,920
 you need to know what that means.

368
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,200
 It doesn't mean, you know, he went and had one too many.

369
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,640
 It means he threw some ragers, okay?

370
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,240
 It says later in the scripture,

371
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,060
 it says that he devoured the property with prostitutes.

372
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,620
 So whatever money can buy, that's what he bought.

373
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,200
 And don't you know that when someone with that kind of money

374
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,320
 and with that kind of influence is the new kid in town

375
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,960
 and the new kid in town has got money

376
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,160
 and he's got a taste for the party,

377
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,420
 you make friends kind of fast.

378
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,000
 So you can bet wherever he landed,

379
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,720
 he ended up being right in the middle of it.

380
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
 He's the new great Gatsby that just came to town

381
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,880
 throwing the huge parties.

382
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,240
 Everybody wants to be a part of it

383
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,280
 and it is reckless living.

384
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,200
 But here's the thing,

385
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,600
 when you spend your wealth in that way

386
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,160
 and you spend your time in that way,

387
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,440
 eventually it runs out.

388
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,440
 The money runs out, the music stops, the friends leave,

389
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,560
 and there's nothing but a wasteland there.

390
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
 It says when he had spent everything,

391
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,800
 a severe famine arose in that country

392
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,760
 and he began to be in need.

393
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,280
 We don't know if years went by, maybe a long time went by,

394
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,800
 but it says he began to be in need.

395
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,300
 So he went and hired himself out

396
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,040
 to one of the citizens of that country

397
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,920
 who sent him into his field to feed pigs.

398
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,680
 Now that's low work for anybody,

399
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,080
 but you need to know for a Jewish young man,

400
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,160
 a national identity to him was very important.

401
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,640
 And to be working for someone who was not an Israelite,

402
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,560
 working for someone who was not Jewish

403
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
 was the ultimate insult.

404
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,720
 On top of that, pigs were considered to be

405
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,000
 the most filthy, dirty, inedible animal to be around.

406
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,240
 You would be religiously unclean to be around pigs.

407
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,640
 And here he is working for someone

408
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,240
 who is not one of God's people and he's feeding pigs.

409
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,480
 And it gets worse, verse 16.

410
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,160
 He was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate

411
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,320
 and no one gave him anything.

412
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,160
 He's begging and he's not even begging for human food.

413
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,240
 He's begging for pig food.

414
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,280
 That's what he wants.

415
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,560
 And some parties land with a louder thud than others,

416
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,680
 but all parties land with a thud.

417
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
 If you've ever been to a party

418
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,080
 and seen it the next morning,

419
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
 you know it's not the scene of festivity

420
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,760
 and it's not the scene of fun.

421
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,680
 There's empty food containers, empty pizza boxes,

422
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,760
 there's empty beer bottles.

423
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,640
 Some poor soul may still be there asleep,

424
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,580
 about to wake up realizing what's going on.

425
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,600
 And it's just an absolute wasteland.

426
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,540
 And what used to be the place where people were gathering

427
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,080
 is now the farthest place that people wanna be from.

428
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,840
 And that's where he found himself.

429
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,520
 He woke up hungry, broke and alone.

430
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,600
 And that is eventually what happens

431
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,520
 when you party your life away.

432
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,360
 I've tried that.

433
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,320
 And finally, he does the first sane thinking

434
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,200
 that he's done in a long time.

435
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,000
 It says, "But when he came to himself, he said,

436
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,040
 "How many of my father's hired servants?"

437
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,440
 These guys just work for my dad.

438
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,520
 They're not even the sons.

439
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,440
 They're just not even my brothers.

440
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,880
 They just work for dad.

441
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,740
 "How many of my father's hired servants

442
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,140
 "have more than enough bread,

443
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,360
 "but I'm perishing here with hunger.

444
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,560
 "I'm about to die of starvation because I left dad.

445
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,000
 "I will arise and go to my father and I will say."

446
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,240
 Now, I love what he does next.

447
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,140
 You ever done something wrong

448
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,520
 and you knew you're gonna have to face dad?

449
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,820
 You remember these days?

450
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,200
 Like, you know you're gonna have to face dad.

451
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,800
 And all of a sudden you are a professional speech writer.

452
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,400
 You're like, "Listen, dad, here's what had happened.

453
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,560
 "Before you say anything, let me just say.

454
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,200
 "Before you do that, let me just explain."

455
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,100
 And we all of a sudden, we get very creative.

456
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,560
 And so we just kind of build and build.

457
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,680
 This is just common to humanity.

458
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,880
 It was going on 2000 years ago.

459
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,740
 It's going on today.

460
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,200
 When you're about to have to face dad,

461
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,960
 you get pretty creative about what you're about to say.

462
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,420
 And he writes a pretty decent speech.

463
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,260
 I will give him that.

464
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,940
 So look here, it says, "I will say to him,

465
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,320
 "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,"

466
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,360
 which is absolutely true.

467
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,680
 "I am no longer worthy to be called your son,"

468
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,400
 which is also true.

469
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,200
 By choice, he chose that.

470
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,300
 And then he comes up with a little idea.

471
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,400
 "Treat me as one of your hired servants.

472
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,200
 "Just take me back as somebody who can work for you.

473
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,720
 "Don't even have to call me a son.

474
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,620
 "I'll change my last name.

475
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,700
 "I don't care, I just need to eat.

476
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,560
 "I'll work, it doesn't matter.

477
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,320
 "Just let me on the property."

478
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,040
 And he arose and came to his father.

479
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,160
 Now pause right there.

480
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,100
 I want you to think about years of being gone.

481
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,760
 You haven't laid eyes on your dad or your brother

482
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,240
 or the servants or the extended family in a long, long time.

483
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,020
 And you don't know how they're gonna receive you

484
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,860
 because guess what?

485
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,120
 They know what you've been doing

486
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,520
 and it doesn't make daddy proud nor anyone else.

487
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,040
 And so now you're about to walk back home

488
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,600
 because this is not, you don't catch an Uber,

489
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
 you're walking, okay, long time ago.

490
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,240
 And so you're walking and every step,

491
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,760
 you've got a chance to think about what's been going on.

492
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,840
 You've got a replay going of everything you've done.

493
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,140
 Some of you had this negative replay

494
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,680
 of the low lights of your life.

495
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,360
 And he's walking home and he's got that going.

496
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,760
 He's going, "Okay, I got nothing but the speech.

497
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,200
 "That's all I've got.

498
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,460
 "And I've got dad's reaction and I have no idea

499
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,540
 "what it's gonna be."

500
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:59,900
 And if you don't know why God is worth singing to

501
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,460
 and about not just on Tuesdays, but every day,

502
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,760
 you are about to find out.

503
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,500
 It says, "But while he was still a long way off,"

504
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,920
 so dad's looking, he's waiting.

505
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,480
 "While he was still a long way off,

506
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,460
 "his father saw him and felt murderous."

507
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,580
 No, that's not what it says.

508
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,400
 "His father saw him and felt compassion.

509
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,480
 "And he ran and embraced him and kissed him."

510
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,280
 This is so shocking.

511
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,560
 This is crazy.

512
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,140
 This is insane for lots of reasons.

513
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,800
 Number one, old men in this culture don't run, okay?

514
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,140
 It's a respect thing, all right?

515
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,820
 You earned a right, you put it on cruise control.

516
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,420
 All right, you do not have to run.

517
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,720
 But this man is running, okay?

518
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,020
 Second, men in this culture happen to wear

519
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,840
 what we would commonly call a dress, okay?

520
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,560
 So they would call it a tunic or a cloak

521
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,320
 or something like that, but it's one piece, man.

522
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,920
 And so never put one on,

523
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,800
 but I'm assuming it's not easy to run in.

524
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,720
 And so he is all of that.

525
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,260
 You've ever seen an old man running a skirt?

526
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,400
 I mean, everybody's watching.

527
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,200
 And so he is so excited to see his son

528
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,720
 and he is moving towards him.

529
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,520
 And now if you're him, you're like, "Oh my goodness."

530
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,360
 I don't know about you guys.

531
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,320
 I had a fantastic dad, but he was intense.

532
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,500
 And if I had messed up,

533
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,760
 there was some intensity about that.

534
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,020
 And so if I had done this and I was coming home

535
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,780
 and all of a sudden dad's getting bigger in the windshield,

536
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,380
 I'm running, I'm like, I'm out.

537
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,420
 I don't want anything to do

538
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,860
 with whatever he's about to do to me.

539
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,500
 And it says, but when he got there, it's a hug.

540
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,340
 What?

541
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,280
 He embraced him and kissed him.

542
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,140
 And in shock, because everybody's in shock.

543
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
 I mean, if you're watching, you're like,

544
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,780
 this is a drive by, this is a sprint by punch in the mouth.

545
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,020
 That's what this is about to be.

546
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,420
 And it says, the son said to him, it's like,

547
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,260
 "What do I do?

548
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,100
 I don't know what to do.

549
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,920
 I guess I'll play role on the speech.

550
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,760
 So here we go.

551
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,080
 Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.

552
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,300
 I am no longer worthy to be called your son."

553
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,860
 And you might notice that the speech

554
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,480
 doesn't even get finished because the father interrupts.

555
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,200
 But the father said to his servants,

556
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,340
 "Bring quickly the best robe."

557
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,740
 What?

558
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,980
 Bring him the best robe?

559
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,460
 Did you say quickly punch him in the nose?

560
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,380
 Is that what you said?

561
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,140
 No, it says quickly bring him the best robe we've got.

562
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,420
 Whatever the best garment is that we have in the house,

563
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,660
 I want you to bring it out here

564
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,840
 and I want you to put it on him.

565
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,620
 It's like, hey son, glad you're back.

566
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,460
 What was it you're saying?

567
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,820
 It's not important what you have to say.

568
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,720
 Here's what I have to say.

569
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,660
 Get the best thing that we have

570
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,360
 and put it on him right now.

571
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,500
 And then it says, put a ring on his hand,

572
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,540
 which is a symbol of being in the family,

573
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,700
 a symbol of being a part of this group

574
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,480
 and a symbol of restored wealth.

575
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,820
 And it put shoes on his feet, get guys dirty.

576
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,100
 Don't you know he's just nasty, smells bad, he's dirty.

577
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,940
 Put shoes on his feet.

578
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,940
 And then it says, and bring the fattened calf and kill it.

579
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,900
 Now listen, if you're a vegetarian,

580
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,340
 I got nothing for you right here.

581
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,380
 (congregation laughing)

582
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,300
 My wife and I's birthdays are both in the same month.

583
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,620
 And in that month, we always go and have the fattened calf

584
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,740
 and have some really good steak.

585
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,980
 It is fantastic.

586
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,340
 And my friends, it's in October.

587
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,580
 I'm already thinking about it.

588
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,660
 All right, it's coming up.

589
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,360
 And so the fattened calf is a symbol of a special occasion.

590
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,940
 It's when you eat good.

591
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,220
 It's what you've been waiting for.

592
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,580
 And spontaneously, the dad just says,

593
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,340
 "Hey, we are about to have a party.

594
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,860
 "We're about to eat and celebrate."

595
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,700
 Why?

596
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,300
 "For this son of mine was dead and he's alive again.

597
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,460
 "He was lost and now he's found."

598
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,860
 And they began to celebrate.

599
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,140
 And don't you know the father knew everything

600
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,460
 that had been going on?

601
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,540
 People talk, man.

602
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,100
 People talk now, they talk back then.

603
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,400
 He knew what was going on.

604
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,740
 But he still valued the fact that his son was just home

605
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,780
 more than what his son had been doing.

606
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,420
 And so as act two draws to a close,

607
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,420
 you find out that God wants your presence

608
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,380
 despite your past.

609
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,760
 It might be the best news you've ever heard.

610
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,680
 God wants your presence near him,

611
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,040
 despite where you've been.

612
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,020
 For God, it's about where you are today, near him.

613
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,380
 And there's something inside of all of us

614
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,580
 that just wants to reject that.

615
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,740
 It's like, there's no way, not me, somebody else.

616
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,160
 Maybe the person on the other section.

617
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,020
 Maybe the person on the other row.

618
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,420
 Maybe the person right beside me.

619
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,940
 Maybe me if I hadn't gone quite so far.

620
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,000
 And we try to talk ourselves out of this.

621
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,500
 The point of Jesus's story is that this guy went as far

622
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,640
 as a human being could go.

623
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,480
 Do you understand?

624
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,540
 You are in bounds.

625
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,360
 God wants your presence despite your past.

626
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,700
 That's the goodness of God.

627
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,960
 And my favorite part of the story is actually still ahead.

628
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,180
 Act three.

629
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,380
 And a lot of people stop right there

630
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,460
 because that's a stopping point.

631
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,660
 I mean, could we not pause right there

632
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
 and just bring the guys back up

633
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,580
 and we're singing and worshiping in response to that?

634
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,680
 I mean, that's enough.

635
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,500
 But there happens to be another part

636
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,140
 where the heart of humanity and the heart of God

637
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,440
 is explained even further.

638
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,460
 Verse 25, it says, "Now his older son,"

639
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,760
 you remember this man had two sons.

640
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,460
 "Now his older son was in the field.

641
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,060
 "And as he came and drew near to the house,

642
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,560
 "he heard music and dancing.

643
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,200
 "And he called one of the servants

644
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,060
 "and asked what these things meant."

645
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,880
 What is going on?

646
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,040
 Last I checked, that doesn't just throw random parties.

647
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,240
 "And the servant said to him,

648
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,240
 "Your brother has come and your father has killed him.

649
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,100
 "No, your father has killed the fattened calf

650
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,400
 "because he received him back safe and sound."

651
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,500
 There's so much broken here.

652
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,480
 "But he was angry and refused to go in.

653
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,620
 "His father came out," here's the goodness of God,

654
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,500
 "and then treated him."

655
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,860
 Could have just let him pout outside.

656
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,700
 I don't know about in your house,

657
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,220
 but if I pouted, that was like being cut off

658
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,740
 from your people, nobody pouts.

659
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,660
 "But God, in his kindness," he says,

660
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,900
 "the father comes out and entreats him,

661
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,160
 "implores him, asks him to come inside.

662
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,080
 "But he answered his father,

663
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,700
 "'Look, these many years I have served you,

664
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,380
 "'and I never disobeyed your command.

665
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,220
 "'Yet you never gave me a young goat

666
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,980
 "'that I might celebrate with my friends.'"

667
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,140
 Now there's something you never complain to your dad about.

668
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,180
 Dad, where's the young goat, man?

669
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,740
 My friends and I wanna celebrate.

670
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,840
 The young goat represents even a little bit of a reward.

671
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,260
 "But when this son of yours came

672
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,440
 "who devoured your property with prostitutes,

673
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,880
 "you killed the filet mignon for him."

674
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,540
 What's the deal?

675
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,820
 And there is so much wrong there.

676
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,900
 He's competitive, he's angry,

677
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,540
 he's just a party pooper in general.

678
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,620
 But here's the deepest, darkest secret of all

679
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,020
 that just came out.

680
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,740
 He stayed home, but he didn't love the father,

681
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,540
 not any more than the other son had.

682
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,260
 He didn't love the father.

683
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,540
 He didn't like being near him.

684
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,420
 In fact, he wanted the same thing the younger son did,

685
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,020
 stuff, his own goodness.

686
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,500
 You could say the younger son was lost in his own badness,

687
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,860
 and the older son was lost in his own goodness.

688
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,340
 In your Bible, the parable is probably called

689
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,500
 the parable of the lost son.

690
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,800
 It should be called the parable of the lost sons.

691
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,200
 Because one of these kids left home,

692
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,600
 but they were both far away.

693
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,980
 Because the man who stayed home

694
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,900
 did not enjoy being around God.

695
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,560
 He was a self-righteous person.

696
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,700
 I'm sad to say this represents

697
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,340
 the self-righteous churchgoer.

698
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,340
 The self-righteous person who says,

699
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,020
 "You know what, I'm gonna, I wanna sin.

700
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,700
 "I mean, just like the younger brother wanted to sin,

701
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,680
 "I mean, I want the same thing, but you know what?

702
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,600
 "Instead of just saying yes, like he did,

703
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,700
 "I'll say no for the wrong reason.

704
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,520
 "Like I'll watch him do it, but I'll say no, I won't sin,

705
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,980
 "just so I can feel clean.

706
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,100
 "Just so I can feel a little relatively better.

707
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,880
 "Just so I can feel like I'm a better person.

708
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,600
 "Just so I can keep up my projection

709
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,740
 "and false idea of myself as a righteous person."

710
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,840
 There's nothing fundamentally different

711
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,000
 about what they wanted.

712
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,800
 Neither of them loved God.

713
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,000
 Neither of them loved the Father, that is to say.

714
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,900
 And I'm sad to say that that is where many, many,

715
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,080
 many people who have been in church for decades,

716
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,920
 I'm afraid, live, near God, close to God,

717
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,480
 in God's house, in the meetings, in the services,

718
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,680
 at the porches, in the podcasts, in the book even.

719
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,960
 But there is no love for God.

720
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,400
 And that's why the story is so powerful,

721
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,900
 because the two sons encompass all of humanity.

722
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,960
 If you can hear my voice right now,

723
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,660
 you're some mix of these two guys.

724
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,060
 Because you love something other than God, just like me.

725
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,760
 You love something other than God.

726
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,140
 And in neutral, you'll decide either just to give in

727
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,340
 to that desire or say no to it and be proud that you did.

728
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,900
 And both of them will take you away from the Father.

729
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:44,300
 And listen to how relational the Father is.

730
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,980
 If you are that self-righteous person,

731
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,300
 if you're the person who says, "You know what?

732
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,560
 "I am not the typical North Dallas young adult.

733
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,660
 "I didn't go off and party.

734
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,320
 "And I don't live in this place.

735
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,180
 "And I don't go to these places and blah, blah, blah."

736
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,220
 And that's your pride.

737
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,180
 I wanna tell you, God has a kind word for you.

738
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,460
 Verse 31, "He said to him,

739
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,060
 "Son, you're always with me."

740
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,180
 Didn't you remember that's what this whole thing is about?

741
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,400
 "You're with me.

742
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,620
 "And all that's mine is yours anyway.

743
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,160
 "It was fitting to be celebrated and be glad.

744
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,620
 "For now your brother who was dead is now alive.

745
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,800
 "He was lost and is found.

746
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,380
 "Don't you see, son, I want your devotion.

747
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,680
 "I don't want your achievement.

748
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,120
 "I know your younger brother was a screw up.

749
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,660
 "But the fact that you're doing better

750
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,720
 "doesn't achieve your way into good grace, man."

751
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,460
 The Father wants devotion.

752
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,280
 The Father wants relationship.

753
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,180
 Any good father doesn't want just accomplishment.

754
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,240
 He doesn't want hollow compliance.

755
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,740
 He wants the heart of his children, both of 'em.

756
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,800
 So at the end of Act Three,

757
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,300
 you find that God wants your devotion,

758
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,420
 not your achievements.

759
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,340
 God's not looking for your hollow Christian achievement.

760
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,260
 He's not looking for the verse

761
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,900
 you memorized a long time ago or even last week,

762
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,200
 unless it stirs your affections for him.

763
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,460
 God is not trying to tell you to behave, people.

764
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,620
 He wants to be with you.

765
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,700
 He wants to be with you.

766
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,380
 He doesn't want the older son to sit there and behave.

767
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,380
 He's not saying, "Hey, behave.

768
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,220
 "Hey, behave, behave."

769
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,780
 He's saying, "I wanna be with you."

770
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,520
 He's intensely relational.

771
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,820
 And it is a shame to live close to him and not know.

772
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,500
 It is a shame to live close to God

773
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,700
 and be just more into good than into God,

774
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,800
 to be moralistic and to be empty,

775
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,600
 just so you can feel good about you.

776
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,100
 So I just wanna close by asking you, which son are you?

777
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,860
 Which son are you?

778
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,520
 Maybe a mix of the two.

779
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,460
 I know I've woken up and been discouraged

780
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,480
 to find both sons alive and well in me.

781
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,660
 I just wanna ask you, which son are you?

782
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,540
 Are you a way?

783
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,700
 For some of you, Dallas is a way.

784
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,220
 You moved away and you've done some things

785
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,400
 that if dad heard, it would not be good.

786
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,740
 But the real dad that counts, man, he knows.

787
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,940
 He is aware of what you came to this city to do.

788
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,100
 He's aware of what you are currently doing.

789
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,740
 And he's not chasing you down to harm you.

790
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,460
 He's ready to receive you.

791
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,700
 He wants to be reunited with you.

792
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,460
 This reunion could be waiting on you right now.

793
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,060
 And so if you're the lost son, I wanna tell you,

794
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,940
 if you're the physically far away son

795
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,620
 and you know you're just giving up to your sin,

796
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,860
 you know you just said yes to it,

797
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,300
 and you totally left God behind,

798
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,140
 I wanna tell you, God is waiting for you.

799
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,740
 He wants to be reunited with you.

800
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,660
 He wants to be with you.

801
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,260
 And if you're the son who is at home,

802
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,060
 but somehow you forgot that God's not keeping

803
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,380
 a scorecard on you and you shouldn't be

804
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,700
 keeping a scorecard on yourself,

805
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,780
 somehow you forgot that better is one day in his courts

806
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,660
 than a thousand elsewhere, and somehow you missed that fact

807
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,020
 and you slipped into moralism

808
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,660
 that doesn't have anything to do with your heart.

809
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,480
 You need to know God's interested in being with you,

810
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,300
 and he's glad you're home.

811
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,820
 He's not saying, well, might as well go party

812
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,640
 if you're not gonna love me.

813
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,060
 That's not what he's saying.

814
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,300
 He's saying, be with me.

815
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,860
 If you're gonna be here, be with me.

816
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,540
 If you're gonna be engaged in the local church,

817
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,360
 if you're gonna be, if you're gonna count yourself

818
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,220
 a follower of Christ, be with me 100%.

819
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,660
 I love this story because it involves two brothers.

820
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,500
 And I grew up with an older brother,

821
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,260
 and I'd love to close it tonight by telling you about him.

822
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,260
 He and I grew up rebelling together, if you will.

823
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,740
 So we kind of slept through the same Sunday school.

824
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,400
 And we did the wrong things, man.

825
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,380
 We did a few of the wrong things.

826
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,820
 We drank the wrong things, we smoked the wrong things,

827
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,700
 then we smoked the other wrong things,

828
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,900
 and we decided to steal my mother's car one night together,

829
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,620
 and then we got pulled over by the police at 4.30 a.m.

830
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,580
 Together, this is before I was a believer in Christ,

831
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,260
 neither of us were, and we were both pretty lost.

832
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,200
 And we had heard things like this,

833
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,700
 but it didn't matter to us.

834
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,980
 We wanted to be a way.

835
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,780
 That's what we wanted to do.

836
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,460
 And something happened that changed that for me.

837
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,380
 The night before I went to college,

838
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,380
 I walked in to a church for some strange reason.

839
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,840
 And as I walked in, I heard a communicator

840
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,740
 communicate the love of God and the desire of God for me.

841
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,700
 And I found out the answer to that question

842
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,220
 that we started with tonight, what does God want?

843
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,180
 The answer is you, you, first name, last name, you.

844
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,020
 That's what he wants.

845
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,940
 And that came over me, and that started to change my life

846
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,180
 from the inside out.

847
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,300
 And so what happened all of a sudden,

848
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,500
 when I was 18 and my brother was 21,

849
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,160
 our paths started to diverge a little bit

850
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,940
 because I wanted to be around the Father.

851
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,820
 And now for my brother, he looked at me and he thought,

852
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,160
 you know what, he must have gotten some shot of religion.

853
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,280
 You know, he must have woke up and he must have woken up

854
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,020
 and like grew a conscience.

855
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,980
 You know, maybe he just kind of got indoctrinated

856
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,040
 and now, you know, he was always a little better, you know.

857
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,800
 So maybe he just wants to double down on being better.

858
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,820
 And I'm telling you, that is not what happened.

859
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,100
 And I would try to tell him in return,

860
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,620
 I would say, you don't understand, bro.

861
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,800
 The goodness of God, the fact that God wants me

862
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,220
 and wants you is so real.

863
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,860
 You have no idea how good he is.

864
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,520
 And he just wasn't interested, wasn't interested.

865
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,660
 Well, a year later, our mother passed away.

866
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,540
 And as that happened, I was so convinced that God wanted me,

867
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,340
 despite the chaos of my life,

868
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,340
 and despite the fact that I had been the lost son

869
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,020
 who went away a long way.

870
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,900
 And the fact that he wanted me just took such a grip on me

871
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,700
 that even that hardship drew me closer to God.

872
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,700
 But that hardship, because my brother could not see

873
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,420
 that God wanted him through that chaos,

874
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,740
 it pushed him even farther away.

875
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,640
 And what started out as adolescent partying

876
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,320
 went into full-blown adult alcoholism.

877
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,900
 And the week night or the weekday adventures

878
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,800
 kind of turned into weeknight reality.

879
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,340
 It just became normal.

880
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,380
 And he became more and more confused, more and more angry,

881
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,060
 more and more frustrated at God,

882
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,680
 and more and more convinced that somehow

883
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,800
 I had just woken up and decided to behave.

884
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,320
 And I told him over and over again, several times.

885
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,420
 One night he called me on the phone.

886
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,600
 He flew to Vegas to party by himself.

887
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,380
 This is where this ends, by the way,

888
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,020
 if this is how you feel your life spiraling out of control.

889
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,960
 It doesn't go well.

890
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,200
 He called me from Vegas,

891
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,680
 and he was about to go party by himself.

892
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,440
 And I said, "Man, why don't you just fly home?

893
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,280
 "Why don't we just hang out?

894
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,120
 "Let's talk some more, man."

895
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,520
 So I talked to him on the phone for about an hour.

896
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,540
 And he said, "There's no justice."

897
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,060
 He was confused by the world around him.

898
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,300
 He was angry at the world around him,

899
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,440
 and he raged against the world around him.

900
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,000
 And he just thought there was no justice in the world.

901
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,580
 How could our mom die while there are criminals

902
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,660
 that are thriving millionaires?

903
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,340
 I mean, how could this happen?

904
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,640
 And I tried to tell him, I said,

905
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,520
 "Buddy, it's the chaos of the world.

906
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,360
 "It's not God.

907
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,180
 "God wants you.

908
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,020
 "He's calling for you.

909
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,880
 "He's reaching out, he's reaching out."

910
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,000
 And our paths continued to diverge.

911
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,060
 And about two years ago, I got a phone call.

912
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,820
 I was in the Ridgely Theater in Fort Worth

913
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,260
 on a Sunday morning, and I got a phone call

914
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,000
 that he didn't make it.

915
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,940
 That's the phone call I woke up to

916
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,200
 on Sunday morning while I was in church.

917
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,040
 And you hear something like that,

918
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,460
 and you hope it's not true.

919
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,260
 And so they told me they were at a hospital.

920
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,500
 And so I went to a hospital in North Dallas,

921
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,340
 and he, far North Dallas,

922
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,340
 and he had hit a telephone pole on his four-wheeler

923
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,420
 at 10 in the morning.

924
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,780
 And they didn't know why.

925
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,420
 They didn't know if he had been drinking or not.

926
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,380
 It seemed likely, but we weren't sure.

927
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,660
 We didn't know what kind of intent

928
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,960
 or what was mentally going on

929
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,660
 in his life or heart that morning.

930
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,780
 But I walked into a hospital room,

931
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,420
 and when there's nobody in the hospital room,

932
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,640
 it means it's over.

933
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,360
 And I walked in, and it was him.

934
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,300
 And he was dead.

935
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,980
 And it was real, really real.

936
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:40,740
 And five days later, I stood up at the front

937
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,580
 with him.

938
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,980
 He was right there in the casket.

939
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,940
 I was in the front, suits on, you know.

940
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,740
 And I looked at our family and friends,

941
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,780
 and I said, "Guys, I'm gonna say

942
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,680
 "the most encouraging thing I can say.

943
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,540
 "He had heard that God wanted him.

944
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,480
 "He heard, he knew.

945
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,700
 "And what we can do is we can hope

946
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,120
 "that that penetrated his heart

947
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,380
 "in a way that we never saw.

948
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,780
 "And we can trust God, because we know that God wants him

949
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,980
 "even more than we do."

950
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,020
 But I know this, if he was here right now,

951
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,460
 he would tell you that God wants you.

952
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,980
 He would tell you that God's priority

953
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,180
 in the universe is you.

954
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,340
 He would tell you that Jesus Christ lived a perfect life

955
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,140
 and died a painful death and rose again from the grave

956
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,220
 so that the chaos of the world can make sense to you.

957
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,500
 And that the pain of what you're going through

958
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,580
 can make sense to you.

959
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,540
 And the whole existence I never understood

960
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,900
 was that God was after me.

961
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,140
 That's what he would say.

962
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,500
 And that's what I'm here to tell you.

963
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,780
 I invited him to this room years ago and consistently.

964
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,800
 I wanted him here.

965
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,420
 But here's the deal.

966
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,260
 You're here.

967
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,860
 You get to hear God wants you.

968
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,580
 You get to hear God desires you.

969
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,260
 And I don't know what you came into the room

970
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,380
 thinking God wants from you.

971
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,620
 Maybe you thought he doesn't care.

972
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,020
 Maybe you thought he wants you to suffer.

973
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,820
 Maybe you thought he wants to pay you back for something.

974
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,060
 But the truth is God loves you.

975
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,220
 He wants you.

976
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,740
 He is after you with passion and with ferocity

977
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,780
 and with focus and with a want that you could never

978
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,540
 even dream up for another human being.

979
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,420
 That is how God is after you.

980
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,540
 And you aren't waiting on him, by the way.

981
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,620
 As much as he's waiting on you to want him.

982
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,840
 More than what you thought you were waiting on.

983
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,980
 So I wanna tell you, if you're more into good

984
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,980
 than into God, you're wasting your life.

985
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,500
 And I'm telling you, I hope you didn't miss anything.

986
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,540
 I hope you didn't miss, I hope you didn't misunderstand

987
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,020
 me and think that I think that I'm better

988
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,060
 or I think that I did good.

989
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,620
 If you didn't miss it, I'm telling you,

990
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,740
 the only reason I'm here is 'cause one little idea

991
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,220
 got lodged in my head.

992
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,060
 It's the idea that God loved and wanted.

993
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,980
 And God loved and wanted me.

994
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,580
 That's the only reason I'm here.

995
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,860
 And I'm telling you, if you don't believe God wants you,

996
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,580
 the end of your life has already started.

997
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,140
 But if you know that God wants you

998
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,540
 and you know that he desires you

999
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,020
 and you know that he can turn this thing around no problem,

1000
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,260
 then whether you are in heaven or on earth,

1001
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,340
 you are with him.

1002
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,780
 And that is better than being any other place.

1003
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,940
 Let's pray together.

1004
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,580
 Thank you for sending your son

1005
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,820
 to take the form of a servant,

1006
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,660
 to pursue us and make a statement of your love to us

1007
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,100
 that we can know your love for us.

1008
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,940
 Thank you that you wrote the words.

1009
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,060
 By this we'll know your love.

1010
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,100
 By this you demonstrate your love

1011
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,460
 that while we were sinners, Christ died for us.

1012
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,060
 There's not a one of us in here that is good, God,

1013
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,020
 and we know that.

1014
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,900
 God, both of our strategies ran dry a long time ago.

1015
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,460
 The desire to go off and do what we want

1016
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,140
 and the desire to stay home and pretend we're good,

1017
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,620
 they're both dead ends, God, and we confess it

1018
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,860
 and we welcome you.

1019
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,340
 Thank you for your entreaty of us.

1020
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,820
 Thank you for your love and pursuit of us.

1021
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,300
 You could have just let us go,

1022
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,540
 but you desire us in a way

1023
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,340
 that changes us from the inside out

1024
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,580
 and it preserves life,

1025
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,700
 not just eternally, but right now.

1026
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,980
 And God, for any human being in this room,

1027
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,780
 any human being in these rooms,

1028
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,300
 any human being who is connected to us in any way,

1029
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,620
 God, if they don't know what it's like

1030
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,220
 to have that reunion,

1031
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,980
 if they don't know what it's like to feel that embrace, God,

1032
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,340
 I pray that they would just feel that wash over them

1033
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,220
 in these very moments,

1034
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,300
 because you're glad to see us

1035
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,780
 despite the mess that we're wearing.

1036
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,980
 We love you for it and we thank you for it.

1037
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,480
 for it, in Jesus' name, amen.

1038
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:12,480
