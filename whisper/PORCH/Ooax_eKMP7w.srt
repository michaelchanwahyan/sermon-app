1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 (dramatic music)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,340
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:18,880
 - All right, here we go.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,160
 Ready up for romance, kicking off.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,960
 Welcome friends here, Fort Worth, El Paso,

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,240
 Phoenix, Fayetteville, Philadelphia,

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,840
 wherever you are joining and tuning in from, Nashville.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,480
 We are kicking off a new series, Rated R for Romance,

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,800
 looking and exploring love, dating, relationships,

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,320
 and looking specifically at the Song of Solomon.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,320
 What would you say is the greatest love song of our era?

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,560
 - Maybe.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,480
 - Maybe, okay.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,760
 In this room, we're probably divided about some.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,280
 There's probably some classics that make the list,

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,400
 like this oldie but goodie from T. Swift.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,560
 (silence)

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:07,800
 Love story, such a classic.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,280
 Or maybe you, like me, can bring it back to high school

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,040
 and you're like, dude, this was just the jam back then.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,400
 Hit that falsetto, Usher, come on.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,240
 But I think without question,

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,840
 the greatest love song of our generation,

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,960
 or of just like this era that we're living in,

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,200
 has got to be this by your girl, Whitney.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:55,200
 (laughing)

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,400
 Falsetto coming from the audience, man.

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,920
 Oh, dude, what is it with that song?

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
 It almost makes you emotional in here.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,840
 You're dating, you're welcome.

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,560
 The reason I start there is 'cause tonight,

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,200
 we are starting a series where we are looking at a song

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,200
 that the Bible calls the greatest love song of all time,

34
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,160
 the Song of Solomon.

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,200
 And for the next six weeks, we're gonna explore

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,120
 just the relationship that this song that Solomon,

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,760
 who wrote in 1 Kings chapter four,

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,120
 we're told that Solomon, who was a king in ancient Israel,

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,800
 lived 3,000 years ago, so some of this literature

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,840
 we're about to study will be the oldest literature

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,760
 you maybe have ever read.

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,840
 And Solomon wrote a ton of songs, not thongs.

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,560
 (laughing)

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,320
 Hopefully he didn't write a ton of thongs.

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,400
 But he did write a ton of songs.

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,200
 And this one, he said, was the greatest of all of them.

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,880
 Get your, yeah, rate it R, man.

48
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,960
 It is rated R for romance, okay?

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,840
 And so we're gonna explore.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,960
 So here's what you need to know about this song.

51
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,000
 It's never been, I don't know that it's ever been

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
 more needed and more relevant.

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,440
 We live in a culture that both loves love

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
 and is really bad at love.

55
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
 Everyone loves it.

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,480
 You know, there's a reason why "The Bachelor"

57
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,840
 is the most successful show, like on ABC,

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,960
 year after year, wow, this room.

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,480
 And yet at the same time, we live in a culture

60
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,960
 that the divorce rate is 50% where no one seems

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,160
 to be able to, or many people, though they fall in love,

62
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,280
 they don't seem to be able to stay in love.

63
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,120
 There's kind of bad example after bad example

64
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,080
 that we're given from Hollywood,

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,200
 and just the most notable names are people

66
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,640
 who fell in love but they couldn't stay in love.

67
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,200
 We're given bad example after bad example,

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,560
 including many of "The Bachelor," you look around,

69
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,360
 trending over the weekend is Miley Cyrus

70
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,360
 leaves her bisexual relationship with a girl.

71
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,040
 She just had divorced her husband.

72
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,600
 We just are given one bad picture

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,560
 of what it looks like to have love and romance

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,240
 after another.

75
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,440
 And even the ones that we would all be like,

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,400
 oh, they're so beautiful, must be amazing,

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,120
 that Brad and Angelina, they end up falling apart.

78
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,400
 And so, so many different bad examples are given,

79
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,940
 and it would be awesome if there was a great example.

80
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,640
 And the good news is that God, who's there, loves romance.

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,400
 He created it, he loves sex, he created it,

82
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,480
 and he intended it to be a part of just his incredible

83
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,560
 design for human relationships,

84
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,760
 specifically in the context of marriage.

85
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,800
 And he gives us this amazing, beautiful picture

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,680
 in the Song of Songs.

87
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,280
 And it showcases what a romantic relationship

88
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,140
 should look like, really from the chase to the wedding

89
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,520
 to the rest of their life together.

90
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,560
 It's a book that, honestly, as we're gonna go through it,

91
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,840
 you're gonna be like, dude, I cannot believe

92
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,000
 this is in the Bible.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,440
 It is a book that young Hebrew boys,

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,640
 or just Hebrew men and women, were not able to read

95
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,820
 until they were either married or 30 years old,

96
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,680
 because it was so erotic and sexual

97
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,060
 in its nature and content.

98
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,480
 They're gonna make love two times in this book.

99
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,000
 They are including types of sexual expression

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 towards one another that, dude, you do not wanna read

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,320
 with your mom sitting next to you,

102
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,040
 'cause you're like, I cannot believe this is in there.

103
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,800
 And so we're gonna explore what God has to say,

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,080
 because God, one of the greatest lies that people are told

105
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,040
 is that God is against sex.

106
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,360
 God created sex, he is all about it.

107
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,640
 And he wants you and I to experience his design for sex

108
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,880
 in the context of marriage and have a romance

109
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,360
 like so few people ever begin to experience

110
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,200
 or ever really experience inside of their life.

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,360
 So we're gonna look at this book

112
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,280
 for the next handful of weeks.

113
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,000
 Here's what you need to know about the book.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,640
 It is Hebrew poetry.

115
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,600
 In other words, it was a song,

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,920
 and the original Hebrew language,

117
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,120
 which is what it was written in and translated to English,

118
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,200
 it was a song that rhymed together.

119
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,120
 So a lot of the things you almost miss out on,

120
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,360
 so we'll try to highlight some of those,

121
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,760
 because it was just like a song.

122
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,400
 It had moments where it rhymed and flowed together.

123
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,360
 And in the song, it has three different characters.

124
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,400
 It has a man, a woman, and her friends.

125
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,720
 It has a man who speaks about 30% of the time,

126
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,800
 a woman who speaks about 55% of the time, feels normal,

127
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,720
 and then her friends, 'cause it's like,

128
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,360
 man, if you're gonna be my lover,

129
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,320
 you gotta go with my friends.

130
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,080
 And that's what we're gonna trace and see

131
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,140
 as we explore this book together.

132
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,880
 And tonight, we're gonna look at the chase.

133
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,720
 What do I mean by the chase?

134
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,400
 I mean those kind of initial stages in dating

135
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,380
 where the book starts off.

136
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,180
 I don't know if you are in the middle of a chase right now,

137
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,420
 if you are like, I haven't had anyone chasing me

138
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,440
 in years or ever, or you are someone

139
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,700
 who probably needs to stop chasing,

140
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,160
 'cause they said no, but it's applicable to all of us,

141
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
 'cause at some point, that initial stage of relationship

142
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,180
 is gonna be a part of your life.

143
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,000
 And what does it look like to successfully navigate

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,540
 those waters together?

145
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,660
 Most of you will be married in the next decade,

146
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,500
 statistically.

147
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,080
 It's not a guarantee, I'm not making promises,

148
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,580
 but statistically, the majority of you

149
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,520
 in the years that you're a part of are gonna decide

150
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,360
 who is gonna be your spouse.

151
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,680
 And next to who is gonna be the God that you worship,

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,600
 who is going to be the person you marry

153
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,980
 is one of the most important decisions that you can make.

154
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,200
 And so if we're gonna do so and have the opportunity

155
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,960
 to learn from what God says this is who you should look for,

156
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
 this is how you should handle the chase,

157
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,080
 what a tragedy it would be to not take advantage of that

158
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,480
 and to learn from Miley Cyrus

159
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,080
 versus the God of the universe.

160
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
 So in this book, we're gonna go through the chase,

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,340
 dating and engagement, the wedding night and sex,

162
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,440
 conflict, how to stay in love after you fall in love,

163
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,160
 and kind of a till death do us part,

164
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,520
 continuing to move together and marry together.

165
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,080
 So tonight, I'm gonna read the verses

166
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,480
 that we'll cover from this first chapter.

167
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,920
 There's a lot of Bible we're about to cover,

168
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,740
 a chapter and six verses total.

169
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,960
 So if you didn't get a quiet time in,

170
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,320
 you're about to get it in right now.

171
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,200
 Here we go, we're gonna start in verse two.

172
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,360
 After verse one, he says, "The song of songs,"

173
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,760
 Solomon's song, and it immediately launches into her.

174
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,540
 She's the first one speaking.

175
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,820
 "Let him," talking about her boo,

176
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,240
 "kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,

177
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,400
 "for your love is more delightful than wine.

178
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,340
 "Pleasing is the fragrance of his perfumes.

179
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,260
 "Your name is like perfume poured out.

180
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,140
 "No wonder the young women love you.

181
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,180
 "Take me away with you, let us hurry.

182
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,860
 "Let the king bring me into his chambers."

183
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,340
 The friends jump in, they say,

184
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,620
 "We rejoice and delight in you, you too.

185
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,920
 "We will praise your love more than wine.

186
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,140
 "How right they are to adore you."

187
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,740
 Her speaking, "Dark am I,"

188
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,940
 talking about her skin complexion,

189
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,980
 "yet I'm lovely, daughters of Jerusalem.

190
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,980
 "Dark like the tents of Kadar,"

191
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,180
 which is just this kind of tribe

192
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,180
 that made these dark tents,

193
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,860
 "like the tent curtains of Solomon.

194
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,660
 "Do not stare at me because I'm dark,

195
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,980
 "because I've been darkened by the sun.

196
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,940
 "My mother's sons were angry with me,

197
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,620
 "and they made me take care of the vineyards,

198
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,340
 "and my own vineyards I hadn't neglected."

199
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,580
 So she's just, in that culture,

200
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,820
 it would have been attractive,

201
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,300
 unlike in our culture where it is like,

202
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,020
 everyone is trying to get tan.

203
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,100
 In that culture, everyone was trying

204
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,860
 to not be tan, 'cause it showed

205
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,580
 that you were out working in the fields a lot

206
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,660
 if you were dark, showed you were a commoner.

207
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,740
 So she's basically saying, like, man,

208
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,060
 she's got this humble insecurity

209
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,260
 about the way that she looks,

210
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,140
 but she also knows that she's lovely.

211
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,560
 Verse seven, she speaks to him,

212
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,800
 "Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flocks,

213
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,220
 "and where you rest your sheep at midday.

214
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,460
 "Why should I be like a veiled woman

215
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,420
 "besides the flocks of your friends?"

216
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,620
 He speaks and responds in a flirty, almost playful way,

217
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,220
 "If you don't know most beautiful of women,

218
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,940
 "follow the tracks of the sheep,

219
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,540
 "and graze your goats, your young goats,

220
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,380
 "by the temps of his shepherds."

221
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,020
 You know exactly where I am, lady, you come and get me.

222
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,040
 Verse nine, he speaks, "I liken you, my darling,

223
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,860
 "to a mare among Pharaoh's chariot horses."

224
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,900
 I'm gonna come back to that, 'cause he's not just saying,

225
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,320
 girl, you like a horse.

226
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,940
 Your cheeks are beautiful, and your earrings,

227
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,220
 your neck with strings of jewels,

228
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,240
 will make earrings of gold studded with silver.

229
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,420
 While the king was at his table,

230
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,820
 my perfume, she's speaking, spread its fragrance.

231
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,260
 My beloved is like a sachet,

232
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,620
 that's just kind of like a necklace with a sack on it,

233
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,020
 of myrrh, that's perfume, that would have been in there,

234
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,980
 resting between my breasts.

235
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,420
 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms

236
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,920
 from the vineyards of En Gedi.

237
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,300
 "How beautiful are you, my darling," he says,

238
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,380
 "Oh, how beautiful, your eyes are like doves."

239
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,500
 Doves could only focus on one thing at a time,

240
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,540
 so he's not saying, you have birdie little eyes,

241
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,460
 he's saying, you only have eyes for me.

242
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,220
 "How handsome are you, my beloved,

243
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,620
 "oh, how charming," she says to him.

244
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,260
 Our bed is verdant, or green, as in, of grass,

245
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,220
 and the beams of our house are cedars,

246
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,020
 rafters and firs, talking about the kind,

247
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,840
 they're outside in a park, if you will,

248
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,340
 having a conversation.

249
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,260
 She says, "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valley."

250
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,260
 He says, "Like a lily among thorns

251
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,540
 "is my darling among young women."

252
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,220
 She says, "Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest

253
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,760
 "is my beloved among the young men.

254
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,880
 "I delight to sit in his shade,

255
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,360
 "and his fruit will be sweet to my taste.

256
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,640
 "Let him lead me into the banquet hall,

257
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,020
 "and let his banner over me be love."

258
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,280
 Beautiful.

259
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,800
 "Strengthen me with raisins," she says,

260
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,660
 "refresh me with apples," those are aphrodisiacs.

261
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,760
 "For I am faint with love.

262
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,860
 "His left hand is under my head,

263
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,420
 "and his right hand embraces me.

264
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,800
 "Daughters of Jerusalem," she then turns

265
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,260
 and talks to her friends.

266
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,560
 Actually, she's getting all hot and bothered.

267
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,340
 "I charge you by the gazelles and does of the field,

268
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,420
 "do not arouse or wake in love till it so desires."

269
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,560
 What I wanna cover tonight as it relates to the chase

270
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,260
 is I would call red flags in romance.

271
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,600
 I wanna look at some of the characteristics

272
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,140
 that mark this couple's relationships,

273
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,460
 and there are five red flags

274
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,220
 that if they do not mark your relationship,

275
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,540
 or if the things that we're gonna cover

276
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,320
 are absent from your relationship,

277
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,660
 you should be concerned.

278
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,580
 And as you navigate the waters of a relationship someday,

279
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,040
 'cause maybe you're like, "Man, I'm single,

280
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,420
 "and I have no way to apply this right now."

281
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,620
 In some context, in some future day,

282
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,060
 you may enter into a relationship,

283
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,780
 and you need to know, "Hey, these are red flags

284
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,620
 "I should really be concerned about."

285
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,220
 Consistent red flags all throughout the Scripture,

286
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,580
 the Bible says, but tonight we're gonna see it

287
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,760
 as we look at some of the characteristics

288
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,060
 that mark their relationship,

289
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,460
 and if they're absent from yours,

290
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,460
 you should be concerned.

291
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,700
 So red flags in dating.

292
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,660
 The first red flag that I wanna highlight

293
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,220
 comes from the first couple verses that she said,

294
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,300
 and it's that you should have a red flag

295
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,940
 if what attracts you to them

296
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,220
 does not include their character.

297
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
 If what attracts you to them

298
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,380
 does not include their character,

299
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,080
 or when their character is not what attracts you to them.

300
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,920
 Red flag number one.

301
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,940
 Why do I say that?

302
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,300
 She basically, the first verse,

303
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,460
 it says, "Hey, let him kiss me."

304
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,580
 Another translation says,

305
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,420
 "Kiss me, and kiss me, and kiss me again."

306
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,420
 And she's basically going like,

307
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,220
 "Dude, this is a guy, I want him to lay one on me right now."

308
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,220
 And if you read that, you're going,

309
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,740
 "What has possibly got her so in the mood?"

310
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,460
 And she says, "Here's why.

311
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,300
 "My man," verse three,

312
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,380
 "is pleasing in his fragrance and perfumes."

313
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,200
 But he says, "But his name or his reputation,

314
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,420
 "the person that he is, is like perfume poured out."

315
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,460
 In the original Hebrew, it actually all rhymes together,

316
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,300
 but she basically says like,

317
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,060
 "Dude, this brother smells good,

318
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,460
 "but even better than how he smells on the outside

319
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,220
 "is the type of person he is on the inside."

320
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,140
 His reputation, his name,

321
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,160
 is like the highest and greatest perfume

322
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,220
 that there could be.

323
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,660
 It's of incredible value.

324
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,140
 What attracts her most to him

325
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,780
 was not an outside appearance,

326
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,860
 but his character, his reputation,

327
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,620
 who he was as a person.

328
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,440
 And this drove her to go,

329
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,140
 "Man, that is someone that I want to be

330
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,060
 "in a relationship with."

331
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,820
 Is what attracts you to the person that you're dating,

332
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,140
 their character, like who they are,

333
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,640
 their relationship with Jesus,

334
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,260
 their ability to be trustworthy.

335
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,740
 The person, not just how they look on the outside,

336
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,660
 but are you attracted to, can you with integrity,

337
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,980
 like if you're dating someone right now,

338
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
 is part of what attracts you,

339
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,380
 and I'm not saying, like physical attraction,

340
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,940
 dude, I hope you're madly in love

341
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,420
 and madly attracted on the outside of what they look like.

342
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,280
 But if you don't have a character

343
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,700
 that you're also attracted to,

344
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,940
 you are attracted to something that is fleeting,

345
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,660
 declining, and the Bible says deceiving.

346
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,340
 It's going away, the character's gonna be there.

347
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,960
 And so if you do not have someone,

348
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,620
 or if the character of the person that you're dating

349
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,340
 in a relationship is not attractive to you,

350
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,300
 you should be concerned.

351
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,740
 Is what attracts you to them their love for people?

352
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,140
 The way they treat people?

353
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,820
 The way they use their time, the words that they say?

354
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,080
 The way they keep their word or promises?

355
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,760
 Do they seem like someone who's gonna be a good mom

356
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,820
 or a good dad?

357
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,020
 Someone that you want your daughters to be like someday.

358
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,260
 Someone you want your sons to be like someday.

359
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,420
 Is what attracts you to them, your character.

360
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,460
 Girls, the Bible says that a man

361
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,780
 is supposed to lead you in marriage.

362
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,500
 And if you're gonna allow somebody to lead you

363
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,340
 in a relationship, in your marriage,

364
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,860
 I cannot stress enough,

365
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,220
 you need to be asking, who is leading him?

366
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,140
 If you're gonna allow him to lead your life,

367
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,500
 he's gonna lead the direction of your family,

368
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,180
 lead your children someday.

369
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,260
 Ask them the question, is he being led by himself,

370
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,900
 by his own desires, by his future work preferences

371
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,380
 and his dream for his life,

372
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,080
 or is he led by the Spirit of God and the Word of God?

373
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,840
 And the same I would say to guys.

374
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,340
 Guys, if you're gonna ask a girl,

375
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,660
 and you wanna know, is this a girl who's gonna be like,

376
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,380
 dude, she's just gonna wear me,

377
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,860
 I cannot stress this so important.

378
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,420
 There's so many beautiful women

379
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,260
 who guys go in and they're like, oh man,

380
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,700
 they're just, look at her, this is amazing,

381
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,540
 we're gonna have this amazing sex someday,

382
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,740
 and they get in and the wife is nagging,

383
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,740
 she doesn't love them, she doesn't love Jesus,

384
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,700
 she's selfish, she ends up just doing anything

385
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,300
 but pursuing God's best, and they're just really hot.

386
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,620
 And that honeymoon sex, it faded away,

387
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,540
 and now the relationship and romance is cold.

388
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,300
 You need to be asking, hey, this is a woman

389
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,780
 that I wanna covenant my life with.

390
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,140
 Can she follow me?

391
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,320
 How do I know if she can follow me?

392
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,640
 Is she following Jesus right now?

393
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,780
 And so the way that you can determine,

394
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,140
 like, is this someone who has character in their life,

395
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,860
 is like, hey, what if they're a guy, what is leading him?

396
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,740
 What's directing his life?

397
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,180
 Is he a part of a church and committed

398
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,500
 underneath the authority of elders?

399
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,940
 'Cause that's what the Spirit of God in the Bible says,

400
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,100
 it leads men to do.

401
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,940
 Is she being led to spend time caring for other people?

402
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,460
 Does she serve with her gifts?

403
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,980
 That's what someone who follows Jesus is gonna do.

404
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,100
 What is the character of the person that you're dating?

405
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,460
 And if they are not someone who is following Jesus,

406
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,940
 focusing on the relationship with them,

407
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,220
 where character, who they are as a person,

408
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,300
 is what jumps out and attracts you to them,

409
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,940
 you should be concerned.

410
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:34,100
 This is so huge, and I'm gonna try to say this

411
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,180
 as gently as I can.

412
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:41,240
 Bad character attracts bad character.

413
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,740
 And good character attracts good character.

414
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,820
 In other words, they find each other.

415
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,660
 Like if you're, and so bear with me,

416
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,940
 if you are in a place where you're like,

417
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,900
 dude, I've just been in one dysfunctional relationship

418
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,340
 after the next, all men are pigs,

419
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,900
 can't believe these guys are just a bunch of jerks out there,

420
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,100
 this is just what they are,

421
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,180
 and I've just had like seven messed up jerk guys

422
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,420
 take advantage of me, it's just what guys do.

423
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:08,380
 Who's the common denominator in all of those relationships?

424
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,060
 It's you.

425
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,780
 Or they're hot.

426
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,500
 But it's you.

427
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,220
 Like if you're dysfunctional,

428
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,820
 I've said before, my wife is a counselor,

429
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,980
 she'll always just say like,

430
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,820
 man, the level of dysfunctionalness in a person,

431
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,340
 it's like the other person will find

432
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,060
 that same person of dysfunction.

433
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,660
 The best way that you can set yourself up

434
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,660
 to have the type of marriage

435
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,340
 and to find the type of spouse that you want

436
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,500
 is to focus on your character.

437
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,340
 Because the opposite is true,

438
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,380
 like someone of good character who's following Jesus,

439
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,780
 who cares about the things God cares about,

440
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,620
 they're not gonna date someone who has bad character.

441
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,420
 You know that, right?

442
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,060
 Like in other words, you feel like, man,

443
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,740
 what the Bible says, when it lays out,

444
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,260
 like this is what a godly husband should be,

445
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,140
 should lay his life down for his wife

446
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,940
 and serve her and care for her

447
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,860
 and spend time with his kids

448
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,940
 and sacrifice all of his desires

449
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,660
 to care for the needs of his family,

450
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,580
 that's a really mature character man.

451
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,340
 And the best way that you can focus on

452
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,220
 making sure that you move in the direction

453
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,020
 of having that type of man in your life,

454
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,780
 and it's not guaranteed,

455
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,500
 but the best way that you can move in that direction

456
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,180
 is by being that type of,

457
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,380
 or being the type of person that that man is looking for.

458
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,340
 'Cause a man of incredible character

459
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,580
 is not gonna be like, oh, you know what,

460
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,060
 you know, she's out, she's probably gonna sleep around,

461
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,380
 she's got kind of this side addiction

462
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,380
 or she drinks a little too much,

463
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,340
 but dude, she is smoking hot.

464
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,380
 That's not a man of character.

465
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,660
 And so the best thing you can do right now

466
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,820
 is focus on working on your relationship with Jesus,

467
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
 not focusing on dating.

468
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,260
 Some of you may need to break up and just say,

469
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,540
 I'm gonna go to the region,

470
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,980
 I'm gonna work on my character,

471
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,220
 I'm gonna develop and become the type of person

472
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,300
 that God wants me to be.

473
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,780
 And I'm gonna set myself up, hopefully,

474
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,460
 to find a spouse that has that same vision,

475
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,980
 shares those same values and character,

476
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,220
 which lasts far longer

477
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,820
 than the physical characteristics

478
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,260
 that I see today that are gonna be gone tomorrow.

479
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,020
 I had a friend recently call

480
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,220
 and they were sharing about a relationship

481
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,340
 that they had just formed,

482
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,180
 they had not been walking with Jesus

483
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,220
 for really any amount of time,

484
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,860
 and really kind of in general,

485
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,020
 they'd just kind of been in and out,

486
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,300
 they'd been in some rehab,

487
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,460
 and God's grace is big enough

488
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,940
 and bigger than all of that stuff,

489
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,220
 but just had just been a mess.

490
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,100
 And they called and they were like,

491
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,340
 hey, got this new girl, you're gonna love her,

492
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,700
 she's a church girl, loves Jesus, Christian,

493
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,380
 it's been great, we're going to church together,

494
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,220
 living together.

495
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,660
 And my biggest red flag was like,

496
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,620
 man, I don't know that that's true.

497
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,140
 I don't know that she is falling in Jesus,

498
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,340
 because she's dating you.

499
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,580
 And if she was following Jesus,

500
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,420
 she would be dating someone who's following Jesus.

501
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,940
 And you're not following Jesus right now.

502
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,820
 And so my biggest flag and biggest concern about her

503
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,700
 is that she's dating you.

504
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,140
 And you need to get healthy,

505
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,660
 you need to get into an abiding relationship with Christ,

506
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,980
 you need to get in community with other people around you,

507
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,340
 and as gently and as compassionately as I can,

508
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,580
 I don't mean to say that to pick on you,

509
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,940
 'cause that's applicable to some of us in the room.

510
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,100
 The biggest concern I would have

511
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,940
 is that they're dating you.

512
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,260
 And you need to say,

513
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,380
 man, I've just not been following what God says for me,

514
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,620
 but what the Bible lays out,

515
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,740
 a type of romance and love that is possible for me,

516
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,380
 the type of peace that can mark my home

517
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,700
 and my children could grow up in,

518
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,820
 I would love to have that.

519
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,260
 And God says, work and focus on your character.

520
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,340
 So the first quality, first red flag is that

521
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,540
 what attracts you to them is not their character.

522
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,980
 The second quality is when others

523
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,340
 don't celebrate their relationship.

524
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,780
 You see in verse four,

525
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,540
 that the friends chime in and they say,

526
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,540
 we rejoice and delight in you, you too.

527
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,620
 We praise your love more than wine,

528
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,220
 how right they are to adore you,

529
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,540
 more than wine or more than the party,

530
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,060
 essentially, that would be.

531
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,220
 Hey, better than any weekend party thing

532
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,140
 that we're getting together is this relationship.

533
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,380
 They had friends in their life being like,

534
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,300
 dude, this is amazing.

535
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,580
 You guys are better together than you are apart.

536
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,380
 We celebrate, we're all about it.

537
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,940
 Why do I say the word celebrate?

538
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,940
 Because the people in your life

539
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,140
 are not coming alongside and going like,

540
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,940
 I'm not just kind of neutral on you guys moving forward,

541
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,380
 but this is a great thing.

542
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,500
 People in your community group or your small group,

543
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,580
 people who are believers in your family or friends,

544
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,420
 people coming around being like,

545
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,300
 this is awesome, I support this.

546
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,980
 I support you dating him.

547
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,420
 He's the type of guy that I wanna date someday

548
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,020
 or that I hope my children end up dating.

549
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,860
 Oftentimes, the inverse is true.

550
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,020
 Where people in our life try to tell us like,

551
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,940
 hey, I'm just concerned.

552
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,420
 He doesn't seem like that great.

553
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,980
 He doesn't seem like that great of a guy.

554
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,780
 Or I'm not sure he's the right one for you.

555
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,820
 And if that is things that you're hearing,

556
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,260
 you should be concerned.

557
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,500
 Whoever over and over says that God's provision

558
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,140
 and protection for us is other believers in our life

559
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,140
 speaking out the truth of what they see.

560
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,460
 Oftentimes, this leads people to go,

561
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,220
 to almost like buy this lie that's like,

562
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,380
 you know what, the world is just against us.

563
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,420
 Everyone's jealous of our love together,

564
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,700
 and they don't like it because they just can't have it,

565
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,940
 and it's so sizzly together, and I don't even care.

566
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,700
 I'm disconnecting from everyone.

567
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,060
 This couple didn't do that.

568
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,980
 How do I know that?

569
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,300
 Because you can't celebrate what you don't see.

570
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,660
 And they had people in their life going like,

571
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,060
 this is a great thing.

572
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,940
 Are people in your life encouraging

573
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,100
 and celebrating the relationship,

574
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,500
 or are they concerned about it?

575
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,600
 And if so, you should be concerned.

576
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,140
 If you have believers in your life,

577
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,980
 and you're dating someone,

578
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,300
 I wanna encourage you to ask them these two questions.

579
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,340
 Like in your community group,

580
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,660
 I wanna invite you to take advantage of what God says,

581
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,140
 that plans fail for lack of counsel.

582
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,700
 Over and over, the prophets say like,

583
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,340
 man, you gotta have wise people in your life

584
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,180
 speaking into it.

585
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,500
 So I wanna invite you, if you're dating someone,

586
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,340
 and you're in a community group,

587
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,060
 or you're in a small group, or someday if you ever are,

588
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,900
 to invite them in and ask them this question.

589
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,920
 I wanna hear from each of you.

590
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,060
 Does anything that you see in my relationship with him,

591
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,740
 or my relationship with her,

592
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,820
 give you pause about us moving forward?

593
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,600
 Honestly.

594
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,420
 Does anything that you see in my relationship with him,

595
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,540
 or in him, or in her,

596
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,740
 give you pause about us moving forward?

597
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,580
 Honestly.

598
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,880
 And invite them to speak in.

599
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,440
 And the second question being,

600
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,340
 do you think that we're good together?

601
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,940
 Do you think that we're good together?

602
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,060
 If you're in the room, and maybe you're like,

603
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,740
 dude, I have a friend that is in a relationship,

604
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,860
 it just seems toxic, I'm concerned about them,

605
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,780
 I don't think he's a believer, or she's a believer,

606
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,820
 just I feel a burden, and maybe I should say something,

607
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,660
 how do I do that?

608
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,860
 Here's how you do that.

609
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,500
 You go to them individually,

610
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,020
 and humbly, and prayerfully,

611
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,660
 you just say, man, can I just share with you what I see?

612
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,340
 I'm concerned about Rob.

613
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,980
 I'm concerned about Jessica, I'm concerned about her,

614
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,540
 and here's the three things that I've noticed

615
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,380
 that could be wrong,

616
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,300
 I'm gonna be open to the fact that you may be wrong,

617
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
 but just communicate, as someone who loves you

618
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,580
 and cares about you, is committed to seeing you flourish

619
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,980
 like I hope you are for me,

620
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,820
 I just felt like I had to bring this up,

621
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,660
 'cause I'm concerned, I have so many friends,

622
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,700
 or know so many people just in doing this

623
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,260
 for the last 10 plus years,

624
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,160
 that they didn't have friends in their life

625
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,380
 that spoke those truths, and everybody saw it,

626
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,060
 'cause here's the deal, dude, most people, we see it.

627
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,220
 It's not crazy where it's like, oh yeah, I saw that coming,

628
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,700
 and they ended up divorcing one another,

629
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
 just entirely fell apart,

630
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,180
 and nobody ever told them the truth in that dating phase.

631
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,100
 And the worst thing you can do, candidly,

632
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,380
 is stop being the friend who,

633
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,140
 when you don't think a relationship is healthy,

634
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,660
 follow them on Instagram together and be like,

635
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,220
 oh my gosh, heart, heart, heart, love this,

636
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,220
 when they post a picture of them two together,

637
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,860
 and you're like, yes, this is so beautiful, I love it,

638
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,300
 hope I get in the bridal party,

639
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,400
 that you are not being a good friend.

640
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,740
 But you can be a good friend,

641
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,020
 but it involves you going, if you see something,

642
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,360
 and saying something.

643
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,500
 So that's the second quality,

644
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,940
 is, or second red flag that you should have,

645
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,660
 is that people in your life, or other believers,

646
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,460
 are not celebrating the relationship together.

647
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,300
 The third one,

648
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,500
 is really almost personal,

649
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,940
 but the best way I know how to put it,

650
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,820
 is a red flag of like, whenever you are not okay,

651
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,980
 or they are not okay being single.

652
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,820
 Why do I say that?

653
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,100
 'Cause one of my favorite lines in this first chapter

654
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,460
 is what she says to the guy, where she says,

655
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,420
 tell me you whom I love, where you graze your flock,

656
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,880
 where you rest your sheep at midday.

657
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,640
 Why should I be like a veiled woman

658
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,540
 beside the flocks of your friends?

659
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,620
 She's basically like, hey, where you at, boy?

660
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,100
 I wanna come and be around you.

661
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,260
 What gym do you go to?

662
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,300
 I wanna go to that gym.

663
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,140
 Where do you live?

664
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,240
 I'm gonna, you know, put myself in your presence.

665
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,740
 I want to be around you.

666
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,860
 And then she says, and I'm not just looking for any man.

667
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,180
 Why would I wanna be like a veiled woman

668
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,020
 that's a prostitute?

669
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,620
 She's basically like, hey, I'm interested

670
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,900
 in waiting for the right person,

671
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,500
 and if I don't find the right person,

672
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,980
 I'm not just gonna put myself out there

673
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,740
 among the flocks of your friends,

674
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,080
 or among the flocks of other people.

675
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,740
 I'm looking and waiting for the right person.

676
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,060
 She was content with being single.

677
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,120
 It was okay if she wasn't in a constant state

678
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
 of being in a relationship with someone.

679
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,860
 Are you someone that is okay in this season of singleness?

680
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,960
 That you're allowing God to grow your patience,

681
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,020
 grow your contentment in him?

682
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,220
 You're allowing God to teach you,

683
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,300
 and you're believing and seeking to trust,

684
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,900
 man, Jesus is enough, I'm okay.

685
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,220
 I'm not going from one relationship

686
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,140
 to the next relationship to the next relationship.

687
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,140
 Are you someone who's like, man,

688
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,580
 I've never been single for more than three months?

689
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,900
 And it may be that you're not okay being single.

690
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,540
 And that may be something that you need

691
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,700
 with other people in your life to evaluate.

692
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,900
 The second thing I love about that verse

693
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,180
 is it answers a question that so many girls ask all the time.

694
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,860
 One of the most common things that we got asked this week

695
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,100
 was like, hey, is it okay for a girl

696
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,260
 to show she's interested in a guy?

697
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,180
 And this woman would say yes.

698
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,300
 I mean, that's pretty forward, where you're like,

699
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,980
 hey, boo, where you gonna be, 'cause I'm gonna be there.

700
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,360
 And I may just conveniently show up and be like,

701
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,700
 oh, I didn't know that you shopped at this grocery store.

702
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,300
 But I followed you here, so now I do.

703
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,700
 And this is great, should we go in together?

704
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,140
 And he was reciprocating.

705
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,340
 He was like, girl, you know exactly

706
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,600
 where I shop at this grocery store.

707
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,420
 You followed me here, I saw it, I liked it, okay?

708
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,980
 And that's what happened.

709
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,940
 It's like it's catty and it's flirty

710
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,300
 and it goes back and forth.

711
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:35,740
 But she, she puts herself out there.

712
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,140
 And in some ways, I think that's an okay thing.

713
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,620
 Generally speaking, guys, step up.

714
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,700
 There's a bunch of godly, amazing, beautiful girls

715
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,120
 in this room, ask 'em out.

716
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,060
 But also, women, I don't think it's inappropriate

717
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,900
 for you to put together an event

718
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,640
 and strategically try to put yourself

719
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,440
 in the presence of godly men.

720
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,380
 Be like, hey, we're going to the movies

721
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,740
 and I'm inviting these other four people

722
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,300
 so I can invite you, wanna ride together?

723
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,820
 And I think there's some level where that's okay.

724
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,920
 Or throwing it out on the radar.

725
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,020
 You probably should realize, and my team told me

726
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,220
 not to say this, but I'm going here anyways.

727
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,600
 Guys are a lot less intelligent than you think.

728
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,960
 So when you throw the event, yeah, claps, good.

729
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,280
 When you throw the event, you're like,

730
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,120
 oh man, I'm totally putting myself out here.

731
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,720
 Like, hey, do you wanna, we go to the movies

732
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,260
 with all these people and ride together.

733
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,840
 He's going, oh, I love that movie, that sounds great.

734
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,440
 I wanna see Avengers.

735
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,560
 For real, you drive?

736
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,680
 I love to save on gas, this is cool.

737
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,520
 He had no idea.

738
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,200
 So you just need to know, it's,

739
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,760
 and I know there's some guys that are picking it up

740
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,260
 in the room, I was not one of them.

741
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,980
 And in fact, I don't know that I would be married

742
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,000
 if my wife didn't throw herself on the radar

743
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,020
 out there to me.

744
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,920
 Where we were working at this Christian camp

745
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,640
 and I was teaching at the camp over a couple summers

746
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,640
 and I remember she wrote these different notes to me,

747
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,720
 like just for encouraging.

748
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,760
 And I didn't know her well.

749
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,240
 I knew that she, we had gone to the same college

750
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,000
 and knew of her character, knew positive things,

751
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,080
 but she wrote these notes and she was like,

752
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,680
 I was totally putting myself out there.

753
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,040
 And I just read the note like, oh my gosh, that's so nice.

754
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,720
 She loved the message, that's amazing, this is great.

755
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,740
 But it did put her on my radar in a way

756
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,040
 that only continued to grow from there.

757
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,120
 So all that to say, point being,

758
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,800
 is it okay to strategically put yourself

759
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,360
 in the presence of godly men?

760
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,200
 Yes.

761
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,400
 Hopefully that answers your question.

762
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,240
 All right.

763
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,760
 Moving on to red flag number four.

764
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,920
 When there is lack of clarity in the relationship,

765
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,360
 you should be concerned.

766
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,140
 When there is lack of clarity in the relationship,

767
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,320
 you should be concerned.

768
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,920
 This is a couple and the guy leads well

769
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,480
 by defining who she is to him,

770
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,040
 both to her and everyone else around him.

771
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,140
 What do I mean by that?

772
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,240
 On multiple occasions, like that mayor,

773
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,040
 where he brings up, hey, you're like the mayor

774
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,560
 of Pharaoh's chariots, or the mayor

775
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
 that pulls Pharaoh's chariots.

776
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,920
 What does that even mean?

777
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,900
 Well, the horses that would line whenever Pharaoh

778
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,640
 would go to war, he'd bring all the soldiers out

779
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,140
 and they'd go out to war and they'd form this huge line

780
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,780
 of all the warriors together and there would be

781
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,160
 black stallions that lined, it was an intimidating force.

782
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,000
 You'd see black horse, black horse, black horse,

783
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,080
 except for right in the middle would be Pharaoh

784
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,560
 and he would be led by a white mayor,

785
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,600
 a white female horse.

786
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,560
 So Solomon's basically saying, hey, you're like

787
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,740
 the only one for me, you're my bae.

788
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,160
 You're before anybody else, you are the only girl for me.

789
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,800
 Everything else, I'm not even seeing it.

790
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,160
 You're one of a kind, that's how I see you.

791
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,240
 And then she says that I am like a rose of Sharon

792
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,680
 and a lily of the valleys.

793
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,320
 It's an incredibly beautiful verse,

794
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,400
 unless you actually study what that verse means.

795
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
 And what I mean is like a rose of Sharon

796
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,780
 was an incredibly common flower.

797
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,280
 And a lily of the valley was like very, very common.

798
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,880
 In other words, she's saying like I'm nobody,

799
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,040
 I'm nothing special, I'm just kind of a commoner.

800
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,200
 I'm like a dandelion amongst a field of weeds.

801
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,720
 That's who I am, I'm nothing special.

802
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,180
 She's almost doing what I feel like girls still do today

803
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,440
 where they downplay themselves in hopes that the guy

804
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,480
 would be like, no, you're not.

805
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
 You know what I mean?

806
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,480
 Where girls are like, oh my gosh, look at this picture.

807
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,080
 Oh, I just, oh, this is, ah, I look terrible in it.

808
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,920
 And you're hoping the guy isn't like, oh, yeah, yeah.

809
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,400
 [audience laughing]

810
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,040
 That is not your color for sure.

811
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,440
 It's okay, everyone has bad hair days.

812
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,720
 I mean, you'll get an accent.

813
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,920
 You're hoping the guy is like, are you serious?

814
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,960
 You look like Mona Lisa is put to shame right now.

815
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,200
 Which is not that hard to do.

816
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,200
 [audience laughing]

817
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,900
 It's not my notes, I apologize, that one got me, okay.

818
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,720
 I lost track of thought.

819
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,780
 The point being, you hope the guy is like,

820
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,280
 man, you are beautiful.

821
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,000
 That's what you look like to me.

822
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,360
 And luckily, our Don Juan responds and says,

823
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,480
 hey, this is who you are.

824
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,880
 You're not some lily of the valley.

825
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,200
 You are like a lily among thorns is my darling

826
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,640
 among all the other women.

827
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,080
 Like, you are the only girl for me.

828
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,600
 Every other woman is like a thorn compared to this lily.

829
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,520
 That's how I see you, that he drives for clarity

830
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,600
 in the relationship with her.

831
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,940
 She does the same in her comment about her myrrh

832
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,880
 being around her necklace.

833
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,240
 The myrrh would have been the most valuable thing

834
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,320
 and possession that she would have,

835
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,240
 and she'd be like, hey, this is this incredibly

836
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,560
 valuable thing to me, that's who you are.

837
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,480
 And you rest, and you are as it were,

838
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,180
 resting close to my heart, this thing of incredible value.

839
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
 In a verse later, a couple of verse later

840
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,440
 in chapter two, verse four, so two verses later,

841
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,320
 he literally says, hey, let him lead me

842
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
 into his banquet hall, let his banner over me be love.

843
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,160
 What does that mean?

844
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,200
 It's incredibly beautiful, whatever it means.

845
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,440
 But here's what it means.

846
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,120
 A banner over something would signify

847
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,420
 like this is whose this is, or it kind of designates

848
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,960
 like this is who I am and whose I am.

849
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,920
 Like similar to a flag, you know at the Olympics

850
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,800
 when all the teams come in and they carry the flags,

851
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,360
 and they're like, oh, there's Jamaica,

852
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,080
 and there's USA, and there's just all the different teams.

853
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,920
 In the same way, when you went off to war,

854
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,920
 people would carry a banner, and it would declare

855
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,840
 we're the nation of Israel, we're the people of God.

856
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,240
 And she's saying, hey, when I go in,

857
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,000
 it's like I went into his banqueting hall,

858
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,340
 the palace banqueting hall, publicly on display

859
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,920
 for everybody, and his banner over me was love.

860
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,200
 This is my girl.

861
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,800
 He was not ashamed to publicly display, this is my girl.

862
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,880
 He brought clarity to the relationship.

863
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,040
 The Facebook status was changed.

864
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,520
 He was willing to say, I'm in with this girl,

865
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,940
 I'm in love, and I don't care who knows it,

866
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,080
 is essentially what he's saying right there.

867
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,640
 If you're in a relationship, and the guy or the girl

868
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,360
 is unwilling, and you've been dating for more

869
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,720
 than a couple dates, or you've been dating

870
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,740
 for more than a month, and they're unwilling

871
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,040
 to acknowledge publicly that there's something

872
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,760
 going on there, you should be concerned

873
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,960
 that you're not dating, you're getting played.

874
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,920
 Because a godly guy with character, and a godly girl

875
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,580
 is gonna fight to bring clarity

876
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,880
 to that relationship together.

877
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,960
 The clarity should mark the relationship together.

878
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,220
 Solomon did not leave her wondering.

879
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,440
 One of the best things, as we've talked about

880
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,040
 so many times, guys, is you will set yourself

881
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,760
 ahead of the pack if you will just do this.

882
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,640
 If you wanna be a guy who you're like, man,

883
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,560
 I wanna wake up and be 10 points more attracted

884
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,080
 to women tomorrow, be a guy who leaves

885
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,040
 by removing confusion.

886
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,760
 Don't leave them wondering, don't leave them going,

887
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,560
 man, where's this thing kinda going together?

888
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,180
 You bring clarity, I'd like to take you out.

889
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,640
 Then at the end of that date, if you wanna continue

890
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,720
 moving forward, you say, I'd like to continue

891
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,280
 taking you on another date.

892
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,100
 I enjoyed our time together.

893
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,280
 I'd love to spend time getting knowing you.

894
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,920
 When you feel like it's clear in your head

895
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,440
 you'd like to do that again, or you'd like

896
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,520
 to spend more time, you sit them down,

897
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,920
 or you call them, or you communicate to them,

898
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,240
 I would love to continue getting to know you

899
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,520
 in an intentional way.

900
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,760
 I'm not sure we're gonna get married,

901
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,920
 I'm not promising any of that stuff,

902
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,520
 I just would like to continue spending time with you.

903
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,800
 And you just tell and telegraph, or you communicate,

904
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,560
 like here's where I see this going.

905
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,280
 Is that okay with you?

906
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,520
 And girls, when they do that, if you're not in,

907
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,420
 don't be like, uh, yeah, and then just ghost 'em

908
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,200
 and not ever respond.

909
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,040
 You say, I'm not interested right now.

910
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,720
 Thank you for honoring me in the way that

911
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,440
 you've communicated and spending time with me,

912
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,320
 but I'm not interested in moving forward.

913
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,000
 You communicate intentionally and drive for clarity

914
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,840
 in the relationship.

915
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
 You need to be intentional, at the same time,

916
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,080
 just don't be intense.

917
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,960
 I also have had guys that feel like they need

918
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,640
 to telegraph every five seconds when they're

919
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,480
 with that person.

920
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,760
 Like, I am now going to sit down and use the salt here,

921
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,800
 and I would like to spend more time with you,

922
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,000
 and I have already chosen six children's names,

923
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,500
 if you would like, just be intentional.

924
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,920
 You don't need to be intense, you don't need to be weird,

925
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,560
 just be like, just consistently be like,

926
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,520
 here's where I see the relationship going,

927
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,840
 and then define the relationship.

928
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,360
 See the responsibility on you to define it.

929
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,600
 And women, bring clarity on those moments

930
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,040
 if you don't want the relationship to keep going,

931
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,820
 but if there's not clarity driven around your relationship,

932
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,080
 you should be concerned.

933
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,040
 You should be concerned.

934
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,720
 You shouldn't be spending, and I think the further

935
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,280
 implication would be like, publicly,

936
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,680
 you should be declaring, if you're in a dating relationship,

937
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,440
 like, it should be no mystery to the world around you.

938
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,160
 Like, I am with her, she's the one I'm spending time with.

939
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,400
 You're not texting other girls, you're not sliding

940
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,600
 into DMs and telling them like, oh, it's other random people

941
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,040
 just kind of putting feelers out in case

942
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,480
 this thing falls apart.

943
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,800
 You're not posting a lot of comments on other girlfriends

944
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,640
 of like, man, you look so great, good to see ya.

945
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,840
 You know, if you make it to town, love to catch up.

946
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,120
 You're not spending a lot of one-on-one time,

947
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,360
 or maybe any one-on-one time with other girls

948
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,220
 that you are bringing clarity to the relationship.

949
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,100
 And whatever clarity you have in that moment,

950
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,020
 you don't have to say like, I've heard from the Lord,

951
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,020
 we're getting married.

952
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,820
 (congregation laughing)

953
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,140
 In fact, that's probably a miss.

954
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:48,020
 I'm gonna go ahead and say, is a miss, in my opinion, okay?

955
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,380
 The point being, bringing clarity as you have it.

956
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,100
 And guys, at the same time, and girls, respect

957
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,180
 when someone says, no, I'm not interested in moving forward.

958
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,420
 You should respect them.

959
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,700
 And if you don't listen to that,

960
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,420
 and you're unwilling to respect them,

961
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,980
 you are disrespecting them.

962
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,580
 And let me just, this isn't even in my notes,

963
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,580
 but let me just say this.

964
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,580
 The picture the Bible paints in 1 Peter chapter three

965
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,420
 about the way that you and I are to interact with,

966
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,100
 and I'm just talking to guys, with girls,

967
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,060
 is kind of terrifying.

968
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,700
 Where it says that God is like a heavenly father,

969
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:24,700
 and he sees his daughters like any son sees their daughter.

970
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,780
 So you should see, like, man, you're not just treating

971
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,780
 this woman, you're responsible for how you interact

972
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,620
 and how you treat them.

973
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,140
 And you should see, you know that dad who sits

974
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,220
 on the front porch with like the shotgun, like,

975
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,340
 (imitates gun firing)

976
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,140
 take care of my girl, son.

977
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,020
 That's how you should see a heavenly father.

978
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,380
 And you are accountable and responsible.

979
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,020
 Listen to me, you are accountable and responsible

980
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,380
 for how you treat them.

981
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,860
 And at the same time, women, you're accountable

982
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,060
 and responsible for how you interact

983
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,700
 and how you're honest with guys.

984
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,860
 So the fourth one was that, and the fifth one,

985
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,220
 final one, final red flag, is when you are

986
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,340
 sexually compromising, or when you're compromising sexually.

987
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,660
 She says this in verse three of chapter two.

988
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,940
 Like an apple tree, among the trees of the forest

989
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,540
 is my beloved among young men.

990
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,580
 I delight to sit in his shade,

991
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,620
 and his fruit is sweet to my taste.

992
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,700
 Scholars disagree on what this verse means.

993
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,260
 So I'm gonna give you both,

994
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,340
 because it's rated R for romance.

995
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,420
 One interpretation, the clearest thing is that

996
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,940
 she's at least saying, you're like an apple tree

997
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,580
 among all the other forest trees that are all normal.

998
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,420
 You're unique to me.

999
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,900
 And then the next verse, scholars would disagree and say,

1000
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,580
 she's either talking about looking forward

1001
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,100
 to performing oral sex, or she is saying that

1002
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,540
 I delight to be a part of the protection and provision

1003
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,660
 that being under his tree brings me.

1004
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,980
 And scholars will disagree across the board.

1005
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,060
 You decide for you.

1006
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,740
 The point being, we at least know

1007
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,820
 she's getting all hot and bothered

1008
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,340
 because the next couple verses say that

1009
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,260
 she is looking forward to increasing amounts

1010
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,980
 of sexual touch to come in marriage.

1011
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,060
 'Cause she says this, strengthen me with raisins,

1012
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,300
 refresh me with apples, I'm faint with love.

1013
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,980
 Both of those are aphrodisiacs.

1014
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,900
 King David, when his men came home from war,

1015
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,500
 he literally gave out raisins and apples to his men,

1016
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,780
 saying, hey, eat these, go be with your wives,

1017
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,620
 make some babies, and that's what he handed out.

1018
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,220
 It was an aphrodisiac that's seen in that day.

1019
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,660
 So she's basically going, oh my,

1020
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,700
 (laughing)

1021
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,220
 (laughing)

1022
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,780
 oh man, I want this man.

1023
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,660
 And give me some apples and raisins, I'm faint with love.

1024
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,020
 His left hand is under my head,

1025
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,060
 his right hand embraces me.

1026
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,660
 And then she says, daughters of Jerusalem,

1027
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,500
 I charge you by the gazelles and the does of the field,

1028
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,620
 do not arouse or awaken love until it's time,

1029
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,180
 or until it so desires.

1030
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,860
 What is she saying?

1031
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,620
 Do not introduce sex

1032
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,140
 before you can fully go all the way.

1033
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,140
 Do not introduce sex biblically until you're married.

1034
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,780
 And that's what the word arouse means.

1035
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,620
 I mean, there's a reason why we call it turned on.

1036
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,180
 God designed you to be turned on in the context of marriage.

1037
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,100
 You don't need to feel bad about that.

1038
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,220
 You don't need to feel bad about having sexual desire

1039
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,460
 for the person that you're dating.

1040
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,940
 That's called normal.

1041
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,140
 But you should be aware that that's not something

1042
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,700
 that you should allow to mark your relationship.

1043
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,100
 You should be very cautious to not allow that turning on,

1044
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,380
 'cause you weren't designed to be turned on

1045
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,340
 and then turned off.

1046
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,540
 You were designed, and God created sexual intimacy

1047
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,860
 to be something that you experience,

1048
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,340
 that the human body is wired

1049
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,780
 to pursue that intimacy together.

1050
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,300
 And she just says, hey, look, man,

1051
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,020
 even though all these desires are here,

1052
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,340
 we're not going there until we can go all the way,

1053
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,380
 until we are married, the Bible says.

1054
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,020
 And if you are compromising sexually,

1055
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,220
 you should be concerned, should be a red flag.

1056
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,940
 If the guy that you're dating,

1057
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,700
 or the girl that you're dating is saying,

1058
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,660
 I don't care what God says,

1059
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,220
 I'm gonna do what my body says,

1060
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:01,340
 I'm not gonna honor sex inside of marriage,

1061
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,380
 what do you think is gonna happen someday?

1062
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,460
 When he is married, he's gonna immediately flip the switch

1063
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,620
 and be like, now I honor sex inside of marriage?

1064
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,780
 The Bible says, man, do not arouse,

1065
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,420
 don't bring that into your relationship.

1066
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,540
 Don't even put yourself in a position together

1067
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,060
 where you're laying down, where you're spending time,

1068
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,820
 where your body is beginning to prepare itself for sex.

1069
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,460
 It was not designed and created to be that way.

1070
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,580
 Here's why I think this is so crazy to us,

1071
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,820
 but so important.

1072
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,540
 The Bible says, and it's so brilliant, dude,

1073
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,140
 like God, in his infinite wisdom,

1074
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,980
 he gave sex, he's all about it, dude.

1075
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,700
 Like here's an answer to the question

1076
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,980
 everyone wants to know all the time.

1077
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,460
 Hey, where is the line?

1078
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,900
 Where is the line, how far is too far, where's the line?

1079
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,020
 The Bible doesn't say there's a line.

1080
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,820
 It says there's a time.

1081
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,060
 It's not concerned about, oh, man,

1082
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,340
 this is exactly where the line is.

1083
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,540
 It says, man, the line is we're gonna explore

1084
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,500
 is pretty far out there.

1085
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,140
 It's more concerned about when the time is,

1086
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,340
 and that's in the context of marriage

1087
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,580
 for a couple reasons.

1088
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,260
 One, sex was given as this powerful thing

1089
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,460
 to glue a man and woman together,

1090
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,980
 that they would become almost intoxicated

1091
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,340
 and bonded together.

1092
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,260
 It even says that sex is intoxicating

1093
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,540
 and it's like getting drunk, the Proverbs say,

1094
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,980
 in Proverbs chapter seven, verse 18.

1095
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,820
 And the reason why that's so crucial

1096
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,420
 is just like it's bad to drive after you're drinking,

1097
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,420
 it is bad to date drunk in sex.

1098
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,300
 And alcohol probably, not even probably, yes,

1099
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,820
 it's bad to date drunk too.

1100
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,380
 But it's bad to be intoxicated in sex

1101
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,340
 because here's what it's gonna do.

1102
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,900
 It's gonna keep you in a relationship

1103
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,020
 longer than you should be in.

1104
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,140
 Just like alcohol, it numbs your inhibitions

1105
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,220
 of like, oh, man, I was gonna go home,

1106
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,900
 but now I'm just hanging out for another party.

1107
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,700
 And you just like quickly, inhibitions go.

1108
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,660
 So it is with sex.

1109
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,380
 And it blinds you to like, man, there's character flaws,

1110
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,900
 and it does what sex is meant to do.

1111
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,780
 Like this is the amazing thing God's designed.

1112
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,900
 It's like I'm gonna give you this powerful thing

1113
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,620
 that's gonna give you the ability

1114
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,620
 to even overlook offenses because you love them so much.

1115
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:07,620
 It's gonna pour this intimacy to bond you together

1116
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,820
 where you're willing to bear with each other,

1117
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,820
 which is amazing in marriage.

1118
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,500
 It's not great when you are dating someone

1119
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,380
 of really bad character.

1120
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,620
 It's not great when you're dating someone

1121
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,980
 and there's clear warning signs that, man,

1122
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,780
 this is not someone that you should marry.

1123
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,100
 But sex, just like getting drunk on alcohol,

1124
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,180
 you're getting drunk and it blinds you from like,

1125
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,100
 oh, man, this is, I'm no longer able to see as clearly.

1126
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,540
 You're putting on drunk goggles

1127
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,060
 as you're dating that person.

1128
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,220
 And the Bible says when it comes to the selection

1129
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,340
 of who you're going to marry other than worshiping God,

1130
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,340
 what else is more important?

1131
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,100
 And so introducing that is incredibly dangerous.

1132
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,220
 The second thing and reason why it's dangerous

1133
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,460
 is think about the just number of scars.

1134
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,700
 Think about just the guilt and shame

1135
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,300
 represented inside of this room.

1136
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,700
 If you're engaging in sexual activity

1137
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,060
 with someone that you're dating right now,

1138
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,900
 God has never wanted that for you.

1139
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,180
 Not 'cause he's angry at sex or angry at you, he loves you.

1140
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,660
 Think about just the scars that people carry uniquely

1141
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,740
 from sexual sin.

1142
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,100
 God didn't give instructions 'cause he's like,

1143
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,300
 man, I just don't want anybody to have fun with this.

1144
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,340
 Are you kidding?

1145
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,780
 We're about to dive in to all types of sexuality

1146
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,780
 and we're not gonna be able to save it

1147
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,940
 for everything that they do in the book.

1148
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,780
 It's very all about it.

1149
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,500
 But that romance being in marriage

1150
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,300
 and he gives instruction and context

1151
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,540
 because this incredibly powerful thing that is sex

1152
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,260
 is also incredibly destructive if used in the wrong way.

1153
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,380
 It's like this.

1154
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,460
 There was a couple months ago where in Dallas,

1155
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,580
 there was a storm and it marked the,

1156
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,220
 it basically like ripped up all kinds of trees.

1157
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,500
 Yeah, welcome to church.

1158
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,500
 It ripped up all kinds of trees in our neighborhood

1159
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,580
 and it tore down trees and like, dude, it was just a mess.

1160
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,420
 If you guys were here in Dallas

1161
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,340
 or you live in any of the neighborhoods,

1162
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,060
 there were trees every single place

1163
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,580
 and while we were looking, I basically was like,

1164
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,780
 man, I need to get a chainsaw.

1165
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,020
 One, 'cause that'd be awesome

1166
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,140
 and two, because we need to cut back some of this brush.

1167
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,340
 Just is like we're living in a jungle right now

1168
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,300
 and so what happens when you get a chainsaw?

1169
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,380
 Well, you go and you begin to examine

1170
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,740
 and you put it all together

1171
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,740
 and you begin to look very carefully at the instructions

1172
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,900
 that Home Depot gives you 'cause you're like,

1173
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,540
 one thing I know is I like my fingers

1174
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,620
 and so I'd like to keep them.

1175
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,380
 So I wanna make sure that I have the right amount of oil,

1176
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,220
 that I use it in the right way,

1177
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,540
 that I'm not careless with it,

1178
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,820
 that I follow the instructions

1179
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,620
 and I keep it away from the ability to cut off limbs

1180
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,940
 'cause it's incredibly powerful

1181
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,820
 but it's also very, very dangerous

1182
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,460
 and so just like in that scenario.

1183
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,380
 (chainsaw buzzing)

1184
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:49,380
 This thing could tear through, thank you.

1185
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,300
 (audience laughing)

1186
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,100
 I've prepared all day for this moment

1187
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,820
 and this thing could tear through my leg.

1188
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:02,140
 It also could remove brush, it'd be an incredible tool

1189
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,020
 and you know what I didn't think with Home Depot

1190
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,580
 and you know what nobody thinks with Home Depot?

1191
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,220
 Is there like instructions.

1192
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,140
 These guys are a bunch of killjoys over here,

1193
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:11,980
 are you kidding me?

1194
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,380
 I'm gonna use this thing however I want to,

1195
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,540
 toothpick, juggle it around,

1196
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,940
 I'll do whatever I want Home Depot,

1197
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,860
 you bunch of fun killers.

1198
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,980
 No, I thought, yeah, I'm gonna read every word

1199
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,900
 and be careful 'cause this thing I know

1200
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,900
 is incredibly powerful and it is incredibly helpful

1201
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,780
 and good when it's used in the wrong way

1202
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,220
 but it is incredibly dangerous

1203
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,100
 when it's taken out of the context

1204
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,460
 and used in a way that contradicts

1205
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,940
 the creator's instructions.

1206
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:45,140
 The Bible says this is how sex is.

1207
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,620
 God created it and he's all about it

1208
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,780
 and he wants that powerful tool

1209
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,260
 just like somebody at Home Depot

1210
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,180
 wants you to use that chainsaw to cut through things

1211
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,580
 and cut back debris, doesn't want you to use it

1212
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,700
 to cut off your hand.

1213
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,620
 And so it gives instructions.

1214
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,340
 So God says, man, I want you to use

1215
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,680
 and experience this incredible tool and gift

1216
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,740
 but I give instructions on how to best do

1217
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,900
 and best experience that

1218
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,180
 because I love you and I care about you.

1219
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,500
 And I'll close here.

1220
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,420
 In conclusion, things to focus on are red flags

1221
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,820
 you should be concerned about.

1222
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,380
 Character is not something that's drawing you

1223
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,100
 to the other person, you should be concerned.

1224
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,300
 If others don't celebrate their relationship in your life,

1225
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,660
 that should give you pause.

1226
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,680
 If it was formed or is being formed

1227
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,260
 in a season where you're not okay being single,

1228
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,160
 you should be concerned.

1229
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,060
 If clarity doesn't market and purity doesn't market,

1230
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,280
 you should be concerned.

1231
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,160
 My heart for this series is that you and I

1232
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,340
 will begin to experience God's design

1233
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,740
 for romance and love inside of your relationship.

1234
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,460
 I had porch leaders, some of our volunteers

1235
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,940
 that lead different teams over to my house

1236
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,580
 and over Christmas break and had a Christmas party

1237
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,740
 and did the whole white elephant here,

1238
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,900
 tacky sweaters, Christmas party, everything was great.

1239
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,220
 Whole night was going amazing

1240
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,420
 and I had a fire pit set up in the backyard

1241
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,040
 where I was gonna have just fire

1242
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,360
 and a moment where we'd come together,

1243
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,500
 kind of family time all together.

1244
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,380
 And I forgot that I just had wood and lighter fluid.

1245
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,100
 And I put the wood inside of there

1246
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,700
 and I forgot to light that wood before everybody came out.

1247
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,580
 So I was like, oh, I'll just light it

1248
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,660
 while everyone's out here.

1249
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,220
 And if you've ever lit a fire,

1250
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,460
 it takes some time to get that wood to actually burn

1251
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,060
 unless there's a foundation of kindling

1252
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,500
 or other things that help it to burn

1253
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,540
 and to continue to burn long term.

1254
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,940
 In other words, you can throw a lighter fluid on there

1255
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,340
 but it's up and then it's gone.

1256
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,380
 Versus if you have the right foundation burning beneath it,

1257
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,100
 it's gonna take longer,

1258
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,940
 but it's gonna burn hotter and burn longer.

1259
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,540
 The book of Song of Solomon is God writing to you,

1260
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,580
 to me, to people everywhere.

1261
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,620
 I want your romance in life to not be something like,

1262
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,500
 it's up in a moment and then it's gone,

1263
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,580
 but something that with the right foundation

1264
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,260
 is gonna burn longer and hotter,

1265
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,300
 more in a way that you want it to for the rest of your life

1266
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,300
 because he loves you.

1267
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,300
 And what I hope for this series more than anything

1268
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,760
 is that you, if you're dating,

1269
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,460
 or maybe you just got out of a relationship

1270
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,900
 and you're just walking through heartbreak

1271
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,340
 and just all the horrific stuff that it is to break up,

1272
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,180
 it's terrible,

1273
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,180
 that throughout this series,

1274
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,260
 you would not just be focused on,

1275
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,420
 man, what are some of the red flags

1276
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,780
 that I should be looking for, but you would be willing.

1277
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,380
 And even tonight, you wouldn't just leave here

1278
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,500
 and focus on one individual or maybe those five red flags,

1279
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,340
 but you would just say, God, I surrender.

1280
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,940
 I'm waving the white flag over my dating relationship,

1281
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,340
 over my life, I'm saying, God, I give it all to you.

1282
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,040
 I'm gonna trust you and I'm gonna do your way.

1283
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,180
 I'm gonna date like you call me to.

1284
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,660
 And I hope this series and our team is praying

1285
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,700
 for this series to just unleash incredible marriages

1286
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,700
 in the future of our country,

1287
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,260
 incredible marriages inside of this room

1288
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,580
 that you would rise up and just say, man,

1289
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,980
 I'm gonna surrender this to you.

1290
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,020
 I haven't done it well, I've really messed up.

1291
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,460
 I've got all red five flags.

1292
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,140
 I've got 'em here with me if you wanna see 'em.

1293
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,100
 No matter where you are in the room,

1294
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,060
 you would say, man, I'm gonna surrender to God.

1295
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,140
 I'll wave just the white flag, God, I wanna do it your way

1296
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,420
 because he is crazy about you.

1297
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,100
 The greatest love story that is contained in the Bible

1298
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:20,000
 beyond song of song is the love story of God's love for you.

1299
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,860
 He's madly in love with you.

1300
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,340
 I mean, like insane in love.

1301
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:26,460
 Like, we are coming in.

1302
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,860
 I love my wife so much.

1303
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,580
 You know what sometimes I think about?

1304
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,100
 I think about I don't know what I would do

1305
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,380
 if something ever happened to her.

1306
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,780
 Both like raising children and operating

1307
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,220
 and also like I would be so heartbroken.

1308
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,780
 I sometimes get sad about the day that we're ever separated

1309
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,020
 if one of us dies first.

1310
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:49,860
 And I've said before and I'll say it again,

1311
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,460
 there is no husband, there is no wife,

1312
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,780
 there is no person who loves their spouse

1313
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,260
 more than God loves you.

1314
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,180
 How do I know that?

1315
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:03,380
 Because he already went to the greatest length possible

1316
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,440
 by sending his son to die in your place,

1317
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,060
 by God becoming a man in the form of Jesus

1318
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,140
 and giving his life for you.

1319
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,500
 And his love for you is so great

1320
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,140
 and for us to think anything other than man,

1321
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,560
 I wanna surrender even my dating life.

1322
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,980
 I'll give it to you, God, 'cause you're crazy about me.

1323
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,140
 I know you're for me.

1324
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:24,380
 You know what's best for me.

1325
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,060
 I'm gonna follow your instructions

1326
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,420
 knowing that you love me and you'll lead me in a life.

1327
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,580
 And I'm praying that some of us in the room,

1328
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:36,700
 'cause a lot, maybe not even most of you are gonna do it,

1329
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,540
 but some of you guys are gonna say,

1330
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,380
 man, I'm gonna do it God's way.

1331
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,220
 Go on forward.

1332
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,380
 I'm gonna date his way.

1333
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,780
 We're gonna handle sex his way.

1334
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,700
 We're gonna pursue marriage his way.

1335
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,060
 It's the best way and it's a way I can trust

1336
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,400
 because he loves me, he's proved it.

1337
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,180
 And any love I'm gonna experience on this earth,

1338
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,820
 if it's disconnected from that love,

1339
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,940
 will not experience the fullness

1340
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,020
 of the romance I was made for,

1341
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,340
 which is a romance first with him

1342
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,720
 and then that bleeds into other ones.

1343
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,560
 Let me pray.

1344
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,900
 Father in heaven, I pray that you would,

1345
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,820
 oh man, unleash the strongest marriages

1346
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,780
 our world has ever seen from this group in front of me.

1347
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,360
 I pray that children would be born

1348
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,080
 to men and women in this room right now

1349
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,840
 who love you, who know you, who walk with you,

1350
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,480
 and they would raise those children to know you.

1351
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,800
 I pray for any relationship here that needs to break up,

1352
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,200
 that they wouldn't leave here covered in shame,

1353
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,200
 they wouldn't leave here covered in guilt,

1354
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,380
 but the spirit of God would be heavy on their hearts,

1355
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,520
 that sin would be confessed,

1356
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,080
 and we'd move in the direction of your love.

1357
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,560
 You've already, out of your love, moved in our direction

1358
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,720
 and pursued a relationship with us.

1359
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,800
 Father, would you bless our time this next six weeks?

1360
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,920
 Would we learn, would we grow,

1361
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,960
 would we be encouraged and strengthened

1362
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,640
 of your design for romance?

1363
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,240
 We worship you now in song, amen.
