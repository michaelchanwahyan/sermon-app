25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 All right, well tonight we are starting a new series,

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Quarter Life Crisis.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 What is a quarter life crisis?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 When we're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 It's miserable and magical, this thing.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Going through this quarter life crisis.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I just thought I'd start, maybe kind of our team put together a list.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Hey, how do you know if you're having a quarter life crisis?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And so I would say, you know, if you recently bought a juicer,

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 and you're eating lots of kale, and you don't know what it is,

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 you might be having a quarter life crisis, right?

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 If you have bought a pet for companionship, and to show your parents you're responsible,

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 you might be having a quarter life crisis.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 If you have a self-diagnosed gluten allergy,

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 you might be having a quarter life crisis, right?

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 If you've started blogging, like you look at your life and it's like,

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 "My life is so boring, but the entire world should know what I'm doing."

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 You might be having a quarter life crisis.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 If you are OCD, but it's the new OCD, okay, wait for it.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 It's obsessive comparison disorder.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 This is where you stay up all night looking at your frenemies,

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Facebook and Instagram, right?

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And you're going to that album, "My Life is So Much Better Than Yours,"

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 and you stay up all night looking at their pictures, and you're like,

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 "Why are they always in Tahiti? How come I'm never in Tahiti?"

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 In fact, if you're always planning a vacation, you might be having a quarter life crisis.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 If you're constantly on Travelzoo or Expedia thinking, "Man, I've got to get out of here,"

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 you might be having a quarter life crisis.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 If you start thinking all the time, "You know what?

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Maybe I just need to go back to school.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Like this career--you know, that's what the solution is to all my problems.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Now, I don't know what I want to go to school for, but I think I just need to go.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Maybe I'll go to grad school, or I'll go get a different degree.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I'll try a different track."

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 You might be having a quarter life crisis.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And if you think the solution to all of your problems is a new job,

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 you know what? "Man, I just need a new job.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I need a new job. You know what I need?

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Here's the deal is I really thought I was at school, I was at college,

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I got that diploma, I worked hard, and now I'm going to make a big splash

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 into corporate America, and I've landed here."

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And it's like, "This is it? This can't be it.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 There's got to be something else."

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And then they started hitting a little closer to home, right?

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 If you think, "Man, I just need a new job."

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 That's what we're going to talk about this evening as we kick off this series,

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 is when life takes us a different direction than we expected.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 In fact, that is what I believe a quarter life crisis is.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 What is it? It's when you thought that you were going one way,

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 and life takes you a separate way.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Let me tell you one of my favorite stories about my kids.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I have two little girls and a baby boy, Weston.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 One of my favorite stories of Presley and Finley when they were a toddler

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 was when we would go to the store.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 When they would go to the store with Daddy, I would usually take one of them.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Finley, in this case, I'll take Finley to the store,

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 and we'll get in that shopping cart, the one with the car on the front.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Do you guys know that one? Yeah. There it is if you don't know.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 There we are, hanging out at the grocery store, having fun.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 That's how we roll.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 We're there. I'll put Finley in that front car.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 When they were toddlers, so when they were a little younger than that,

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 what we would do was this fun game.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 They would get in there, and I would push that cart, and I would watch them.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Wherever they would turn, I would go.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 That's funny because they're bad drivers.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 They're sitting there. When you're a toddler, you don't know how to drive,

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 so you just kind of jerk the wheel back and forth.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I would just do this with the cart, and then they would throw the wheel to the right,

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 and I would just take the cart to the right.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 We'd hit the apple stands. Apples are falling.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 I'd throw the cart to the left, and I'd go to the left, and we'd hit the Cheerios,

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 and the Cheerios would fall over.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 We would just steer that thing through the grocery store.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Finley thought she was driving. She thought she was in charge.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Then every single time we did that, we would have this moment.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 This is the moment. Let me explain it to you.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 She would go right. She'd turn right, and I'd go left.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 The game was over.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I would watch a frustrated Finley grab that wheel and tightly turn it to the right.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Right with all her might. No, right. I said right.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I'd just effortlessly go left.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 She learned in that moment that she wasn't in control.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 At that very point in your life, I think, is when this idea of a quarter-life crisis happens.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 When our expectations aren't met,

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 maybe we had a sense of entitlement and were dealing with disappointments,

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 we turned right, and for whatever reason, life took us left.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 We sit there and we say, "Wait a minute. Why can't I go right?"

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 But the curtain of life just seems to keep going left.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Why?

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Now you can think of a lot of scenarios.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Maybe you're singleness. Maybe you're married. Maybe you're divorced.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Maybe it's relationships.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But tonight we're talking about work.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 When you go right at work, when you steer right at work,

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 but it just seems that God, who is in control, keeps taking you left.

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 In this moment when you realize that you don't have nearly as much control of your life as you thought you did,

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 it is in this moment that your quarter-life crisis begins.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And so maybe you think you do have a lot of control,

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 and you just live in fear of losing that control.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And that is the cause of your quarter-life crisis.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And so you're realizing that someone else is in control,

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 and you're not happy with their pace or their direction.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 And ensues this idea of a quarter-life crisis.

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And so I can look at some stats on our generation in regards to jobs.

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Just six in ten millennials have jobs.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Half of them are part-time jobs.

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 That comes from Harvard University.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Average tenure for Generation Y, that's most of us in the room, is two years.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And so for the generation before us, that was five years.

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And the generation before them, that was seven years.

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 So what's happening is tenure at work gets less and less.

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Most of you will be at your job two years or less.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And what's interesting is we keep looking for happiness in our workplace.

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 We keep trying to find purpose in our career,

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 but our depression stats, our depression rate is 19%.

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 It's the highest it's ever been of any other generation.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 We are the most depressed generation ever to live.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Why is this?

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Because we keep looking for purpose in the wrong places.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And so tonight we're talking about purpose in your career.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I'm going to be in James 4.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 If you don't have your Bibles, turn with me to James 4.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 James is in the back of your Bibles.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 It's one of those small books towards the very end of your Bible.

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Get near Revelation, and you will find James after Hebrews,

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 before 1 Peter, the book of James.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 We're going to look specifically tonight.

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I'm going to ask you three questions.

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 We're going to try to answer three questions from this text in James 4, starting in verse 13.

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Those questions are what is the purpose of your plans?

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Who is determining your direction?

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 What does God have for you to do right where you are?

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And so James is the brother of Jesus.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 We love Jesus. Most of us in the room love Jesus.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And how great would it be to interview someone who actually knew Jesus,

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 not just knew Jesus, but lived with Jesus,

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 ate with Jesus at the dinner table,

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 maybe argued with Jesus, okay,

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 maybe threw the football with Jesus.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 No, they didn't throw the football. It wasn't there yet.

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 But they hung out with Jesus a whole lot.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And so we know that James probably was not a believer

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 that Jesus was the Christ until the resurrection.

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 So the whole time in his life, he just thinks his brother is kind of weird,

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 going around claiming to be the Messiah and walking on water and stuff.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And then all of a sudden he comes back to life.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And did you know that then James, this is history now,

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 James gave his life for the cause of the resurrection.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 In fact, the Jews at that time came to James and said,

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 "James, you've got to stop talking about the resurrection."

176
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 He said, "I will not. I saw my brother came back to life."

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And so they threw him off the top of the temple.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 He wasn't dead yet though, so they went down there

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 and they beat him with clubs until he wasn't breathing anymore.

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 James died a martyr. That's the one who wrote this book.

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 It's known as the New Testament Proverbs,

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 a book of wisdom from Jesus' bro James.

183
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 It's written to the scattered church, the persecuted church,

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 otherwise known as the Diaspora.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 This is who James wrote this letter to,

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 but we can take it and apply it to our lives today.

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 So as we dive in, I want you to go back to a moment with me.

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Do you remember that moment when you graduated?

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 If you graduated, and maybe it was high school, I don't know,

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 but you graduated and you're like,

191
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 "You know what, I know what I'm going to do."

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Everybody has this moment, "I know what I'm going to do.

193
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 "I'm going to go to that city and I'm going to make a bunch of money.

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 "I know what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over there

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 "and I'm going to make a name for myself.

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 "I'm going to make it big. I'm going to go and do something good.

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 "It's going to be awesome. I'm going to move there and do that.

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 "I'm going to go to Dallas and do that."

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And I'm just wondering, if it doesn't work out that way,

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 why wouldn't God tell us?

201
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 If it's going to be different than that,

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 and we're all going to have that moment where we're sitting there like,

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 "Hey, I'm going to move to that city and I'm going to make some money."

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Why wouldn't God tell us it's not going to be exactly like that?

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Let's dive in.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Now listen, literally Greek is translated, "Go now."

207
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 He's trying to get your attention.

208
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 "Go now, you who say today or tomorrow we will go to this city or that city.

209
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 "Spend a year there. Carry on business and make money."

210
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 The Greek there for "carry on business" is "empadromai."

211
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 It's literally where we get the word "emporium."

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 We're talking about a career here.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 We're talking about a place where you go to work to support yourself and others.

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Your emporium, your place of business.

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 He says, "Hey, you need to listen to me if you think,

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 'Hey, I'm going to move to Dallas and make some plans and make some money.'"

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 First question tonight is, "What is the purpose of your plans?"

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 What is the purpose of your plans?

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Is it self-promotion?

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Is it self-advancement?

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Is it self-prospering?

222
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 What do those three ideas have in common?

223
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Self. Are you at the center of your plans?

224
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Because if you are, I think you might have missed something.

225
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I want to talk to you really driven folks for a minute, you really gifted folks.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 You guys that get Dallas, Dallas wants to offer you something really special.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 I get you, man. I get you. I understand you.

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Let me talk to you for a moment.

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Maybe in life you turn left and life takes you left.

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Maybe in life you turn right and life takes you right.

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I want you to know something. I want you to hear me.

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Sooner or later you're going to turn right and life's going to go left

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 and your world's going to come crumbling down

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 because you put the wrong thing at the center of your life.

235
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 You are living for the wrong purpose.

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 I tell you that because I love you. I tell you that because I've experienced it.

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 I tell you that because God's Word says that that's true.

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And so you turn left and life takes you right and you fall apart

239
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 because you thought you were in control.

240
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 For so long life let you think you were in control.

241
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And then all of a sudden you realize you weren't.

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Proverbs 16, 9 says it like this,

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps."

244
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 So let me talk to you for a second.

245
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 If you have a career goal, as you think, "Man, what do I want to achieve with my plans?

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 What are the purpose of my plans?"

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 If the purpose of your plans is your happiness, you've missed it.

248
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 You do not have what's called a biblical worldview.

249
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 You have a worldly worldview.

250
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 This is the message of the world that your happiness is ultimate.

251
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 I hear it so often, "Man, well, all I want for my children is for them to be happy."

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 No, you don't. You want them to be holy.

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 In fact, if they're miserable and holy,

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I would argue that's a whole lot better than them being happy.

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Okay?

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And so in the number one song in America,

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 it's been the number one song for a few weeks, Pharrell Williams, "Happy."

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 It has a subtle lie in it. Let me show you.

259
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 It says, "Because I'm happy, clap along if you feel like a room without a roof."

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Because I'm happy, clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth.

261
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Because I'm happy, clap along if you know what happiness is to you.

262
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Because I'm happy, clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do.

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 What he said is, "What's the truth is how you feel."

264
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And I want you to know that's an absolute lie.

265
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 So often, your feelings do not define reality at all.

266
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 So often, what you feel is very different than what is.

267
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 And you can maybe experience some happiness for a moment, but maybe you shouldn't.

268
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And you can experience some despair in seasons, but maybe you shouldn't.

269
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Your feelings do not define reality.

270
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 There's another truth.

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 What Pharrell is saying, that the end goal is that you would do everything that you can to be happy.

272
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And I'm saying that God is saying you should do everything that you can to be holy.

273
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 When we become holy, he makes us holy.

274
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Christ's righteousness is given to us not by what we do, but what he did.

275
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And so if your happiness is your end goal, I'm afraid you're setting yourself up for failure.

276
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 You can't pursue happiness and get it.

277
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 In fact, the pursuit of happiness is a contradiction in terms.

278
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 To pursue happiness is not to have happiness.

279
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 It is synonymous with discontentment.

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 What leaves you wanting--I've seen guys spend their entire life to the grave looking for happiness, but never finding it.

281
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 But the joy of the Lord, it comes from the Spirit.

282
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Living in right relationship with him, it is a joy that you will never have without him.

283
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Never even understand without him.

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And so have you ever felt like your job was going to make you happy?

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Let me ask you like this.

286
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 This happens all the time.

287
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 You ever had a dream job?

288
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 You're like, "Man, I found a great job."

289
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 People tell me, "Dude, I got a great job.

290
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 "Man, I landed this job. It's the best job. It's my dream job."

291
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 The cynical part of me is like, "Give it some time, man.

292
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 "Pretty soon it's just going to be a job."

293
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 I learned this early in life.

294
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I graduated from college. I was living with my best friend's parents.

295
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 I was waiting tables at the time, and I woke up one morning, and I was like, "Man, I'm going to get a real job today."

296
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 I'm not saying waiting tables is not a real job, but that's where I was at.

297
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 I was like, "I'm going to get a real job today."

298
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 So I put on some khakis and a polo at 8 in the morning.

299
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 I left the house. Usually I wasn't up before 8.

300
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 So I leave the house, and I'm driving around Waco, Texas.

301
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I'm like, "I'm going to get a real job, but I don't know where to go to get a real job in Waco."

302
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 So I go to one of the only places I know. I go to the mall.

303
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 The problem is the mall is not open.

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 So I sat in the parking lot. I don't even think I was a Christian.

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I wasn't following Jesus. I don't think I was saved.

306
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 But I prayed, "God, would you help me find a job?"

307
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And I sat in my truck for an hour.

308
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 And they came, and they unlocked that mall door, and I walked inside.

309
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And I'm walking through the mall, and this girl comes up to me and says, "Hey, what's your story?"

310
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And I said, "Well, I'm looking for a job."

311
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And she goes, "Oh, yeah?"

312
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And she goes, "You want to work at Abercrombie?"

313
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And I said, "Is this how this prayer thing works?"

314
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And I go, "Sure."

315
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 She goes, "You want to manage at Abercrombie?" I said, "Sure."

316
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 She goes, "Where?" I said, "How about Dallas?" She goes, "Okay, I'll get you an interview there."

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 So I drive to Dallas. I interview at North Park Abercrombie.

318
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 I go back to Waco. They call me. They offer the job.

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 I'm going to give you some details. It might make you feel uncomfortable.

320
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 But they call me. They offer me the job.

321
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 They said, "Hey, we'd like to offer you $23,000 a year."

322
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And I began to weep. Tears of joy.

323
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Okay? Truly, my best friend came in.

324
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I remember, given just this long, awkward, manly embrace.

325
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And he said these three words, "You made it."

326
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 It was actually four words. It was, "Dude, you made it."

327
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And I was just like, "Yes, I did, man. I did. I'll do this the rest of my life."

328
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And so I moved to Dallas, and I did it for three months, and I quit.

329
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And then I got a job selling gym memberships.

330
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 100% commission, eat what you kill. I was like, "Dude, I have found it.

331
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 I'm good at this, too. I will do it forever."

332
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 I did it for three months, and I quit.

333
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Sold this guy this gym membership. He was in telecom.

334
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Okay? I went and worked in telecom.

335
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I was making more money than I ever thought that I would make.

336
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I will do this forever. I did it for three months, and then I quit.

337
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 My boss took me to another telecom company. I worked there for three months.

338
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 This is true. I worked there for three months. It went bankrupt.

339
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 I was 21 years old and laid off.

340
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 And I was like, "What just happened?" My whole world was spinning.

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I will never work in telecom again.

342
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 So I did what anyone would do, and I went back to work at telecom.

343
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I did that for five years, and I climbed up the corporate ladder.

344
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And I don't mean to boast. This is just kind of what happened.

345
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And I started pursuing this path, this career in sales.

346
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And when I was making $23,000, it was more money than I ever knew what to do with.

347
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Now I was making 10 times that, and I was very much aware that it would never be enough.

348
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Something happened in a very short period of time.

349
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 I began to pursue fulfillment in my work.

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And I got caught up in it, realizing that fulfillment now--

351
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I realized fulfillment cannot be found in your work.

352
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Your work will never fulfill you. It was not meant to.

353
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 In fact, God said it will be hard, and it will war against you.

354
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 As a result, in the fall, your job cannot fulfill you.

355
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It will be difficult, he says.

356
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 You cannot avoid that difficulty.

357
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And so I think some of our hope is constantly what we will have in the future.

358
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 We're constantly trying to see around the corner.

359
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And I'm telling you, you have set yourself up for some despair, maybe even depression, some hurts.

360
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Why? Why would I say that? Let me show you from the Word, verse 14.

361
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Why? You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.

362
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 You don't know what will happen tomorrow.

363
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 What is your life?

364
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.

365
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Why? You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.

366
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.

367
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Can I show you what James just said your life was?

368
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Look, I'm going to show you a picture of your life. Infancy to the grave. Ready?

369
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Did you see it?

370
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Let me show you your life again. Ready? Here today.

371
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 One more time. Your life.

372
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Here today and gone. It's banished.

373
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 You're like, "No, it's not."

374
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 We've asked you before, "What's your great-great-grandfather's name?" You don't know.

375
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Dude, that's family.

376
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 That's family. Some of you are living on his money, man.

377
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 You don't even know his name. He was alive 50 years ago.

378
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Your life is a vapor.

379
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Oh, let me get this straight. Your strategy is to work hard.

380
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Make as much money as you can so that you can experience as much comfort as you possibly can.

381
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And then die.

382
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And then go to a place that you will be forever and ever and ever and ever.

383
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And there it says you can store up treasures, but you had them here.

384
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Hey, friends, that's bad investing at best.

385
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 That's just bad investing at best. Ask any financial advisor.

386
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 If you are investing in a temporary asset and going somewhere permanent, it's just not a good strategy.

387
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 It's a bad strategy at best.

388
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And so there must be a bigger purpose in our career and our plans than us.

389
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 There must be something else. He who dies with the most still dies.

390
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Verse 15, "Instead," okay, instead, he's going to resolve this.

391
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 "Instead you ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.'

392
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 As it is you boast in your arrogant schemes, all such boasting is evil."

393
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 He says, "Instead, you need to acknowledge the one who is actually in control."

394
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 And so that's my second question this evening is who is determining your direction?

395
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Who is determining your direction?

396
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Asked in another way, it is who is driving?

397
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Are you in the driver's seat?

398
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I meet with young adults all the time, 20s and 30-somethings all the time,

399
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 who are very upset with God because of where they ended up.

400
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And it looks like this, it looks like, "God, how come you let me be in this relationship?

401
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 God, how come I got in this career? You knew I was going to get laid off.

402
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 You knew that guy would be my boss. God, I'm so mad at you."

403
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And my sense is that God's like, "Bro, you didn't even ask me.

404
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Sister, you did not even ask me. You didn't consult me.

405
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 I've been jumping up and down, waving my arms, saying, 'Hey, don't date him.'

406
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 But you weren't listening.

407
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 I was telling you, 'Hey, that job, that's not the best use of your gifts and your talents.

408
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 I've got other plans for you. I want you to glorify me. I want you to honor me somewhere else.'

409
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 But you didn't consult with me."

410
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And some of you might have, but how are you listening?

411
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 How are you listening to him?

412
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Like if you're not regularly in this book, if you're not living life in community,

413
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 if you're not diligently meeting with other followers of Jesus and seeking their counsel,

414
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 as the Scripture says over and over, "Wisdom comes from the counsel of others yielded to the Spirit,"

415
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 then you have hushed the voice of God.

416
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 You've told the Holy Spirit to be quiet. You're not interested in his counsel.

417
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 That you're going to go the way that seems right to you.

418
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Proverbs 14, 12 says it ends in death.

419
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And you're mad at God, and God's like, "Oh, I would have loved to help you. You didn't ask.

420
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 I would have loved to chat with you, but you didn't talk to me."

421
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 This hit home for me.

422
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Years ago, before vocational ministry, Monica and I were processing a move back to Waco now.

423
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And so a friend of mine had started a company there, and the company had kind of taken off.

424
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And he sat down with me and said, "Hey, I would love for you to kind of influence our sales organization.

425
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 You would work side by side with me. We'd be partners in the business."

426
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And the entrepreneurial side of me was very attracted to this.

427
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And so I would tell you that it was something we wanted to do.

428
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 We went to Waco, and we began to look at real estate there.

429
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And this opportunity was going to afford us to buy a house on property.

430
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And we were very excited about that.

431
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 We began to interview churches there.

432
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 We were believers now and followers of Jesus now.

433
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And so we're looking at churches there in Waco.

434
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And I began to wrestle with this idea, "What is God's will? What is God's will?"

435
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And so I couldn't figure it out.

436
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 So I finally gathered some wise men.

437
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Also this idea of community.

438
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And I sat them down, and I said, "Hey, guys, I don't know what God's will is."

439
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And one of them began to point out a flaw in my thinking.

440
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 See, I really wanted to move to Waco.

441
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And he just said this.

442
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 He asked me these questions, which changed my life, rocked my paradigm even.

443
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 He said, "If you go to Waco, and this business really takes off, and you make a ton of money, it goes public even,

444
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 and it just goes so well, was it God's will that you went there?"

445
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And I said, "Yes."

446
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And he said, "If you move to Waco, and this business fails miserably,

447
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 two weeks in, the doors are shut, and you have to move in with your in-laws,

448
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 and you can't feed your children, you can't buy them food,

449
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 was it God's will that you would go to Waco?"

450
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 And I said, "Absolutely not."

451
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And he said, "I think you've got it all wrong.

452
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 You're processing God's will based on your own desires and your own desires alone."

453
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And he said, "Jonathan, is it possible that God would keep you here and refine you

454
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 and sanctify you through difficult times, and that would be His will?

455
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Is it possible that He would send you to Waco, and He would sanctify you there through some challenging times?"

456
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 As James also says, "Rejoice in those trials."

457
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Is that possible, that that would be the Lord's will?

458
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And then he said this, and it changed everything.

459
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 He said, "You need to be asking, 'Where can I honor God the most?

460
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Where can I bring God the most glory?'"

461
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 That is, to honor Him, to serve, and to love Him.

462
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 He told us, "Hey, I want you to love me and love my people."

463
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 He said, "Where can you do that the most?"

464
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And it changed everything.

465
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 We ended up staying in Dallas because we were plugged into a church here,

466
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 and thriving in a community here, and growing in our faith here by others who were teaching us the Word.

467
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 And it made all the difference.

468
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 When we answered that question, "God, where?"

469
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 So this is crazy.

470
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 You could have a job that's a good job, that pays more money than your current job,

471
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 and God could say, "No, stay there, because that's where I have you doing ministry."

472
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And you could be like, "God, I hate it."

473
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And He might say, "I need to change your perspective.

474
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 I need to work on your heart, and I need you to stay there."

475
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And you're asking Him the question, "God, where can I bring you the most glory?

476
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Where can I honor you the most?"

477
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 It's such a selfless question.

478
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 It feels almost Christian.

479
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 So I'm telling you that your job was not meant to fulfill you.

480
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 It just wasn't.

481
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 So what is it for if it's not meant to fulfill you?

482
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Titus 2:10, in a great verse, just says this.

483
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 It says that you work, you have a career, so that in every way you will make the teaching about God, our Savior, attractive.

484
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 You work so that in every way you will make the teaching about God, our Savior, attractive.

485
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 What does James say?

486
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 James says it like this in verse 17.

487
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Listen.

488
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 "If anyone then knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it, it is sin for them."

489
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Okay, man, this feels like a new idea.

490
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Like James just went ADD on us.

491
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 It feels like a little bit.

492
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Okay, it feels like that doesn't fit with the others, and I want to make an argument that it does.

493
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 This last verse here, "If anyone," listen, "then knows the good they ought to do and they don't do it, they sin."

494
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Man, what is he saying?

495
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Okay, this is this profound idea that I believe is extremely biblical and repeated throughout the Scriptures, and it is simply this.

496
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Stop wondering what you're supposed to do and look at the good for you to do right in front of you.

497
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Start considering where does God have me and why does he have me there?

498
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 What is the good that I can accomplish right in front of me?

499
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Maybe I'm so distracted by my schemes and my desires and my plans, which don't include God.

500
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 If I'm honest, they're all about me, and I have missed the purpose why a sovereign creator has me right where he has me.

501
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 See, so often we get so caught up in the unrevealed will of God.

502
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 "God, what is your will for me? God, what do you want me to do? Who do you want me to marry? Where do you want me to work?"

503
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 And we've forsaken the revealed will of God.

504
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And some of us, you know, and God's like, "Why would I tell you my unrevealed will when you've forsaken my revealed will? My revealed will."

505
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 I've told you what to do right there in the Scriptures.

506
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 I want you to love me with your whole heart, mind, and strength, and I want you to love your neighbor as yourself.

507
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 I want you to do the good I have you to do right in front of you.

508
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Will you open your eyes? Will you listen to me? Will you consult with me?

509
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I want to play. I want to use you. I made you for this very purpose.

510
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Can we hang out, man? Can we do this thing? Can I talk with you?

511
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 A third question, final question is this.

512
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 What good does God have for you to do right where you are?

513
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 What good does God have for you to do right where you are?

514
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 I will tell you that miserable jobs make excellent mission fields.

515
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Miserable jobs make excellent mission fields.

516
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Guys, here's the question. Do you believe that God is sovereign?

517
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 That means do you believe that he's put you where you are for a purpose?

518
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Do you believe that? Like, do you believe that?

519
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Like, has his hand slipped off the wheel, or is he still driving this cart?

520
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Did he put you strategically exactly where you are?

521
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 I want to show you from the scriptures and make a case that he has.

522
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Acts 17, verse 24 says this.

523
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 "The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth

524
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 and does not live in temples built by human hands.

525
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 And he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything.

526
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.

527
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 And one man," listen closely, "he made all the nations,

528
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 that they should inhabit the whole earth," this part,

529
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 "and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.

530
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 He chose where they live and when they live.

531
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 He is sovereign over that.

532
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 He has made you for this very purpose."

533
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 This is crazy that God puts you in that company, in that school,

534
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 that God puts you in that community, in that place that he's driving

535
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 and he has his servant right where he wants his servant,

536
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 and he is very much in control.

537
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 And he's doing something, and I don't want you to miss it

538
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 by not seeing the good that you are to do right in front of you.

539
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Paul says it like this, Ephesians 2:10, "For we are God's handiwork.

540
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 We are his masterpiece. We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works."

541
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Literally, the Greek is to walk through the good works

542
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 which God has prepared in advance for us to walk in.

543
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 God made you for a purpose, and he has you right where he wants you,

544
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 and he's accomplishing his will through you if you will look his way

545
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 and pay attention to what he's doing and seek out his agenda.

546
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 See, Presley thought, "I was there for what she wanted."

547
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Do you know why I didn't go right when she turned right?

548
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Because I wasn't there for what she wanted. I was there for what she needed.

549
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 I was there to get groceries. I had an agenda, man.

550
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 And I was accomplishing something that was bigger than her,

551
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 but it certainly helped her because she needs to eat.

552
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And so I was there for something that she needed,

553
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 and she thought I was there for whatever she wanted.

554
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 Guys, God loves you, man. He's crazy about you.

555
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 This is so awesome. This is great news I'm giving you.

556
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 God loves you, and he's in control.

557
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 He controls everything, and he loves you.

558
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Man, how awesome is that? God's so awesome.

559
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 That's so awesome that he controls everything, and he looks at you, and he's crazy about you.

560
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 And then he has a plan for you, a purpose for you,

561
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 and he's created you with some gifts purposefully for him.

562
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Can I show you how James' brother says it?

563
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 This is beautiful. Listen. It comes from the Sermon on the Mount.

564
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 It's Jesus.

565
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 He says, "You," read you, "are the light of the world.

566
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 A town built on a hill cannot be hidden,

567
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.

568
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Instead, they put it on its stand.

569
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 They put it purposefully where it goes,

570
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 and it gives light to everyone in the house.

571
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 In the same way, let your light shine before others,

572
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

573
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 This is what Jesus is saying, is that in the first century homes,

574
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 lights were very expensive. They didn't have a lot of lights.

575
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 They had one light, and they would have to put that light in a very strategic place.

576
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 They couldn't put it in a place where its light would be wasted.

577
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 They would put it in a place purposefully so that others can see.

578
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Jesus is saying that God has put you in a place purposefully so that others can see.

579
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 See who? See Him and glorify your Father in heaven.

580
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 That God has put a light at AT&T and a light at that Richardson ISD

581
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 and a light at that place of business and a light at that company

582
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 and a light in that place and a light in that community so that others can see.

583
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And He put it in a very purposeful place, a very strategic location,

584
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 so that by it others would see Him.

585
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 "They would see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

586
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 How, JP? How can they do that?

587
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 By you doing the good in front of you that He has for you to do.

588
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 In your quarter-life crisis, stop saying, "Where, God? Where?"

589
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 and start saying, "How, God? How?"

590
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Start saying, "What, God? I'll do it."

591
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Stop saying, "Where, God? Where do you want me to work?"

592
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 and start saying, "God, how do you want me to work right here?

593
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 God, what do you want me to do right here

594
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 so that I can honor you and be on mission for you?"

595
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And so stop trying to find your purpose in your career

596
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 and start being purposeful in your career.

597
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 I'm telling you that someone has to take out the trash.

598
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Someone has to do those things, and it might be you.

599
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Someone has to do the things no one else wants to do,

600
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 and God might have created you to do those things so that you can be--

601
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 Some of you are like, "But, JP, you don't understand.

602
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Where I work, it's really dark."

603
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 Good. God has a light there. Turn it on.

604
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Okay? He puts you there on purpose.

605
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Would you shine? Would you shine?

606
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Your purpose is not fulfilled in what you do, but how you do it.

607
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 So what you need is not a new job.

608
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 What you need in this quarter-life crisis is a new perspective in your job.

609
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 What you need most is not a new job.

610
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 What you need is a new perspective in your career.

611
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 So in summary, what is the purpose in your plans?

612
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 I'd love for you to ask these questions in your community group this week.

613
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 And you can even pray this. This is just a great prayer there.

614
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 "God, you have me here for a purpose. Help me see it."

615
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 You ask them, "Who is determining my direction?"

616
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 And you can pray this.

617
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 "God, I don't want to go unless you're sending me. Help me hear you."

618
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 You can ask them, "What does God have for you to do right where you are?"

619
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 And you can pray, "God, you have me here for a purpose. Give me the courage to do it.

620
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Give me the wherewithal to stay here, the stamina, the energy, the joy that I need.

621
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 God, I hate it. Help me. Sanctify me. Make me yours. Take my life. I'm almost dead. Use me."

622
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 I was speaking at a conference not very long ago in this past year.

623
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 I needed an illustration. The title of the talk they assigned to me was "Work is Worship,"

624
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 which is a topic I'm very passionate about.

625
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 And I was looking for this illustration, and I'll tell you the illustration I was looking for.

626
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 It was somebody that was doing a task in a company, but they were actually undercover, like undercover agents.

627
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 And so they're actually working for this larger organization, a government organization,

628
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 but they have to do the day-to-day mundane tasks in this company.

629
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 That was the illustration that I was looking for.

630
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 And so a friend of mine asked me if I had seen the movie "The Informant."

631
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 And I had not, and you don't need to either. It's not very good.

632
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 But it's a movie that came out in 2009 starring Matt Damon.

633
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 I think we might have a picture. There we go.

634
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 And it was called "The Informant," and it was actually a true story.

635
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Now, it's a confusing story, so listen closely.

636
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Okay? It is the true story of a man named Mark Whitaker.

637
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Mark Whitaker worked at a company called ADM.

638
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 At that company, there was the largest price-fixing scandal in U.S. history.

639
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Here's all you need to know.

640
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 There's some people doing some illegal stuff at this company, so illegal that the FBI got involved.

641
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 The FBI finds Mark, who works there, and says, "Hey, we need your help.

642
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 We want you to be undercover for us."

643
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 So for three years at this company, Mark Whitaker wore a wire every single day to work.

644
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 And the instructions they gave him, "We want you to work hard," okay, so you're not to get caught.

645
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 "We want you to talk to a lot of people, to gather information.

646
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 And we want you not to lose your job. Just stay there so that you can help us out.

647
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Report back to us."

648
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Now, I wanted some more information, so I told my friend who told me this,

649
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 "Man, I wish I could gather some more information on this deal."

650
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 And he goes, "Why don't you email him?"

651
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 And I said, "Email him? How am I going to do that?"

652
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 He goes, "Well, it turns out I found his email on the Web.

653
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 You can find anything with Google. And so here, here's his email address."

654
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 So I emailed Mark Whitaker, and I asked specifically,

655
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 "Mark, when you were doing those day-to-day tasks, I imagine they became boring.

656
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Were they more exciting when the FBI said, 'Hey, now you're really working for us,

657
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 but we want you to do the same thing'?

658
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 Did it become more exciting?"

659
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 I had just finished up a porch Tuesday night. It was 930. I was here.

660
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 My phone rang. I said, "Hello."

661
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 I said, "Jonathan, this is Mark Whitaker."

662
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 I said, "Yeah, right."

663
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 He said, "No, it really is."

664
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 He said, "Hey, I got your email. I want you to know, absolutely, man,

665
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 when the FBI came to me and they said, 'Hey, we want you to do the same things,

666
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 but this time we need you to report to us.

667
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 We need you to work hard so you don't get caught.

668
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 We need you to talk to a bunch of people to gather information,

669
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 and then we want you to report back to us all that you have found

670
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 so that we can stay involved in what you're doing.'"

671
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 Man, my job became so exciting.

672
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 Every day I went to work so excited because my perspective had changed.

673
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 Guys, don't you see that's what happened?

674
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 You have been sent by your commanding officer, not the president of the United States,

675
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 not the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but the creator of the heavens and the earth,

676
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 and he put you where you are, and he has a mission for you to accomplish there.

677
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 Do you know what Mark told me next?

678
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 He said, "But, JP," he said, "it's nothing like the mission I have today."

679
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 And I said, "Oh, yeah? Why? Why do you say that?"

680
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 Well, it turns out that Mark actually himself got involved in that price-fixing scandal,

681
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 and he went to prison.

682
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 He served years in prison, and in prison he met a mutual friend of ours, Chuck Colson,

683
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 the late Chuck Colson.

684
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Chuck Colson shared the gospel with him, and in prison Mark trusted Christ.

685
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 And now out of prison, Mark travels the world and tells people about Jesus.

686
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 He said, "Hey, I see you work at a church. I'm a follower of Jesus too."

687
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 He said, "I've never felt more on mission than I am right now."

688
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Do you know what he told me?

689
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 He said, "At ADM, I made $3 million a year."

690
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 He was an executive. $3 million a year.

691
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 He said, "In the United States penitentiary, I made $29 a month, less than a dollar a day."

692
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 He said, "I had never felt more on a strategic undercover mission than I did in the U.S. penitentiary."

693
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 For the first time, I understood why I was actually created.

694
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 I understood that God was sovereign over my plan, even in prison.

695
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 See, also Joseph.

696
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 And that God could use me there to save people, and he has been.

697
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Friend, you're quarter-life crisis.

698
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 You don't have a job problem. You don't have a career problem.

699
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 You have a perspective problem.

700
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 You don't understand that God created you for a purpose.

701
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 You've been living for you, man.

702
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 And I'm here to tell you, you can live for him right where he has you.

703
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 You can shine and be a light and let him call others to know him in greater ways.

704
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 If you would just move past yourself, work hard so you don't get caught.

705
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 Talk to others because you love them, and report back to him, your commanding officer,

706
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 so that he can stay involved in what you're doing.

707
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 Let me pray that you would.

708
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Father, we do ask that you would help us do exactly that.

709
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 We understand that our life is but a vapor, God,

710
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 and that you have plans for us that are bigger than us.

711
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 So, God, would you use us?

712
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 Father, that person that sits in the cube next to us, would you save them?

713
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 That teacher in the other classroom, God, would you save them?

714
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 That coworker, would you allow them to see my good deeds and glorify you in heaven?

715
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 Father, would you use me for your honor and for your glory?

716
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 Would you glorify yourself through me?

717
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 And as I'm asking questions, where should I go and what should I do,

718
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 what I consider most important, what my friends here tonight at the porch consider what is most important,

719
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 is where can we honor you the most?

720
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 Father, use our lives.

721
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 I pray that Jesus would be ultimate,

722
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 that you would remove all of the other distractions,

723
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 and that he would be of most importance to us.

724
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 It's in his name.

725
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 Amen.

726
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 I just don't want you to miss what you're saying.

727
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 Jesus commands my destiny.

728
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 It's true.

729
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 He sure does.

730
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 In Christ alone, man.

731
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 And so some of you, you have forsaken your purpose because you don't know God.

732
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 And my hope is that you're surrounded by people right now who do.

733
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 And so when I'm talking about things like relationship with God or talking to God or consulting with God,

734
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 that's like this foreign idea because you're in your car and you're praying to him,

735
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 and he feels really far or like he's not there at all.

736
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 It feels like your prayers are being kept in that cab.

737
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 Or when you lay in bed and you talk to him, it feels like they're bouncing off the ceiling.

738
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 I've been there.

739
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 I've been there.

740
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 And here's what you need to know, that 2014 years ago in the greatest event in the history of the world,

741
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 God became a human, fully God and fully man.

742
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 He lived a perfect life for about 33 years.

743
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 He's the most polarizing character in the history of the world.

744
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 The book is bestseller year after year and also in the history of the world by a large significant margin.

745
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 His followers are a majority in regards to religion.

746
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 But what he asked of you is love and to know him.

747
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 And what he did was the greatest example of love is he took your sins on him on a cross.

748
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 Every image you've looked at that you shouldn't have,

749
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 every person you've slept with, everything that you've done, word that you said,

750
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 place that you've been, drink that you consumed, line that you snorted went on him.

751
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 He goes in the grave and he came out without it.

752
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 He stayed in the grave, man.

753
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 And if you've trusted in that, it's no longer you who lives but Christ who lives in you.

754
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 Yeah, it's good news, man.

755
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 You can't even do good on your own.

756
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 It's a dependence thing.

757
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 God, help me see it.

758
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 Give me the courage to do it with your spirit through me accomplish it.

759
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 I can't even do it on my own.

760
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 And so if you've trusted in that, he got what you deserved and you get what he deserves.

761
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 You get to be with God forever in his kingdom and he'll work to you even now in this place

762
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 as we patiently await for his return.

763
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 He's coming back too.

764
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 And so I pray that you would live that mission out.

765
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 Don't get caught up in your quarter life crisis.

766
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 Let's build a movement of people in this season changing the world.

767
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 [silence]
