00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:31,480
 All right.

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,620
 All right.

5
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,660
 Welcome to the porch.

6
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,540
 Hey, help me welcome my friends all across the nation.

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,220
 We got the Porch Live, Austin, Texas, Midland, Texas,

 And there's a whole host of more.

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,660
 Help me welcome my friends all across the nation.

00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,180
 [APPLAUSE]

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,700
 And of course, my friends right here in Dallas.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,140
 Anybody watch the Super Bowl?

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,780
 [CHEERING]

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,280
 Chiefs!

 [CHEERING]

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,320
 Hey, hey.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,480
 I'm not a bandwagon.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,360
 I lived in Kansas City almost eight years,

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,160
 moved to Dallas 3 and 1/2 years ago,

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,360
 but grew up in the motherland right here in Texas.

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,560
 Let's make that clear.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,080
 No, I love the Super Bowl.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,160
 Like, I love it.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,920
 Like, I love a lot about the Super Bowl.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,840
 I love the fact that there's two teams, the best

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,240
 two teams of the year.

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,120
 They're facing off, and you hope to be this epic showdown,

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,080
 right?

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,360
 Like, I love the food.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,800
 Anybody, like, just a foodie?

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,600
 Like, I'm a foodie.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,360
 Got to watch what I eat, because, you know,

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,200
 I'll just go to town.

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,760
 Like, there's all kinds of food at Super Bowl parties.

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,840
 And, you know, I love the commercials.

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,000
 You know, you never know what's coming, right?

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,640
 Better guard your eyes, man.

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,360
 But I love the creativity of commercials.

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,240
 I love the halftime.

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,680
 Some of you, you thought the main show was Rihanna.

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,720
 You still don't know the score of the game.

44
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,960
 Oh, somebody, somebody excited about Rihanna.

45
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,840
 The halftime show.

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,440
 But here's what I like the most.

47
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,400
 I love the fact that the Super Bowl brings people together.

48
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,080
 Like, your friends, like, maybe coworkers, neighbors,

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
 you know, just people, you know, in church.

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,760
 Like, it just brings people together.

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,720
 And, you know, let me just show you a pic of my people.

52
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,600
 That's my people.

53
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,360
 So this is who I watch the Super Bowl with, right?

54
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,440
 This is my crew, my people.

55
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,760
 I got my kids.

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,640
 I got the best man of my wedding, my boy JD, his wife,

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,520
 and, you know, best man of my wedding's wife.

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,760
 Like, we just had a blast together.

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,000
 And, you know, what I know about that picture

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,720
 is that picture, the people in that picture,

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
 they're way more important than the game itself

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,880
 and everything that surrounds the Super Bowl

63
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,560
 because they're a part of my community.

64
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,960
 And when I think about this word community,

65
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,080
 there's these two root words that come to mind,

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
 commune and then unity.

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,760
 And so community is this idea that you commune,

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,440
 you gather with people around something

69
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,600
 that you're unified on.

70
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,960
 Here's what I mean by that.

71
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,520
 Like an event or a place.

72
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,760
 So say it'd be the Super Bowl, a birthday,

73
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,600
 maybe it's the gym, you know, happy hour,

74
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,840
 your coffee shop, like that coffee shop,

75
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,680
 maybe it's Merritt, I don't know what your coffee shop is

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,960
 in Indianapolis, but it's your coffee shop.

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,240
 And then you gather with your people,

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,320
 like it might be a coworker, a friend, a neighbor,

79
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,720
 it might be a date.

80
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,160
 And then it's, you know, you're doing some type of activity,

81
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,280
 you're grabbing a meal together, you're eating,

82
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,080
 you're grabbing some drinks together,

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,520
 you're working out, you're going on that first day.

84
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,640
 Like some of you came in this place,

85
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,960
 you're like, man, I hope I get that first date tonight.

86
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,480
 You know, and I would just say, you men,

87
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,040
 hey, shoot your shot, bro, if you're in it, you know,

88
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,800
 if you're in the game and the game is Christianity,

89
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,560
 like you're following Jesus, you're healthy, go for it, man.

90
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,200
 Some of y'all need to step up anyways.

91
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,360
 So that's your encouragement.

92
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,600
 But no, this is what I mean.

93
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,320
 Here's why I say that.

94
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,480
 Because if we had to be honest tonight,

95
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,640
 like our community is comparable

96
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,600
 to what we had on Sunday night.

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,320
 It starts and ends with just that.

98
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,000
 Like the things that maybe you do,

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
 if you had to be honest tonight,

100
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,800
 it just starts and it ends with only that.

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
 That thing you do with the people that you gather with,

102
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,360
 the people that you're unified with.

103
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,160
 We were created for so much more.

104
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,360
 Although this type of community isn't bad in and of itself,

105
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,080
 it's not the only thing we were created to do.

106
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,720
 Like we were created for deep, intimate relationships.

107
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,160
 And like, you know this to be true,

108
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,080
 like don't you like,

109
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,000
 how come the moment you leave that social event,

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,320
 you're hit with a wave of loneliness?

111
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,920
 You have this social anxiety,

112
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,400
 maybe sometimes when you're in the crowd.

113
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,720
 Or you are filled with anxiety,

114
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,840
 like you have a lot of acquaintances,

115
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,040
 but you go home and you're just plagued with this anxiety

116
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,720
 that so much so you have to take sleeping pills

117
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,760
 just to go to sleep.

118
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,480
 Or when you're around those so-called friends,

119
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,600
 like something about that group

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,960
 doesn't really sit well with you

121
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,920
 because they don't know the true you.

122
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,600
 Like they still don't know you.

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,960
 No one really knows you.

124
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,880
 Could it be that the way that we're doing community

125
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,680
 is not at all how God intended for us?

126
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,120
 In the quietness of your own heart,

127
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,000
 I just want you to ask yourself these questions, okay?

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,960
 Just do an evaluation of where you are right now

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,920
 with your people.

130
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,320
 Who in this world really knows you?

131
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,360
 With whom in this world are you fully known,

132
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,800
 but also fully loved?

133
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,080
 Who in this world knows your positive qualities,

134
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,160
 yet they get to see behind the curtain of your life,

135
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,120
 and they see your insecurities?

136
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,160
 They see your hangups,

137
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,200
 your unhealthy tendencies, your weaknesses.

138
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,040
 With whom in the world are you fully known and fully loved?

139
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,920
 See, God has wired us with deep-meaning relationships

140
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,760
 with each other.

141
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,480
 Unfortunately, many of us, we just go through life,

142
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,040
 and we never really experience this.

143
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,240
 So maybe we even settle for isolation.

144
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,640
 Like some of you, man,

145
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,240
 you just wanted to be at a Super Bowl party,

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,480
 but the Super Bowl just reminded you that you're alone.

147
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,360
 Or you come into a place like this,

148
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,440
 and there's just a big place,

149
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,680
 and there's a lot of young adults,

150
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,560
 and yeah, you got some acquaintances,

151
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,760
 but you don't really have your people.

152
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,920
 And listen, we can escape these feelings of being alone

153
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,840
 because today we come into this place,

154
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,000
 and it just happens to be Valentine's Day

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,840
 on a Tuesday night.

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,120
 Gosh, the last thing I needed to be reminded of

157
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,840
 was maybe I'm alone.

158
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,280
 And so tonight, I wanna talk to you

159
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,600
 not about dating.

160
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,680
 Many of you probably come into this place thinking,

161
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,920
 not about your singleness.

162
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,680
 Maybe you thought we were going singleness route.

163
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,240
 Not about sex, not about that relationship

164
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,600
 that you're thinking about, that dating relationship.

165
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,440
 No, I wanna talk to you

166
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,040
 about the most important relationship

167
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,760
 outside of your relationship with Christ,

168
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,280
 and that's the relationship that you have with,

169
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,120
 if you're a guy, man,

170
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,040
 those are the closest men in your life.

171
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,840
 If you're a woman, those are the closest ladies

172
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,480
 that you're rolling up your sleeves with,

173
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,240
 that you're really doing life with,

174
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,160
 that you're spending time with.

175
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,280
 I'm talking about your gathering.

176
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,720
 I'm talking about this sense of community

177
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,880
 that you don't just gather around a place

178
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,540
 and the people and the activity.

179
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,200
 I'm talking about you gathering

180
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,960
 around authentic relationships

181
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,560
 that actually lead to spiritual transformation.

182
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,700
 Do you have that in your life tonight?

183
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,200
 We're gonna be in the book of Genesis,

184
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,620
 the very first book of the Bible.

185
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,460
 So if you have your Bible,

186
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,420
 feel free to open it to the book of Genesis.

187
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,260
 If you don't, that's cool.

188
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,140
 We want that to be our gift to you.

189
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,820
 You can head out to the town center after the service

190
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,660
 and just go to the welcome desk

191
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,980
 and just say, "Hey, I would love to have

192
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,820
 "a copy of God's word.

193
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,940
 "I would love a physical copy of that."

194
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,420
 And so tonight we're gonna be in the book of Genesis,

195
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,700
 the very first book of the Bible,

196
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,100
 and then we're gonna be in chapter two,

197
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,820
 starting in verse 18.

198
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,100
 Y'all remember what God said to Adam

199
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,780
 before he made Eve?

200
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,980
 This is what he says in verse 18.

201
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,420
 The Lord God said, "It is not good for man to be,"

202
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,260
 come on, come on.

203
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,940
 - Alone. - Alone.

204
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,140
 Alone, someone's fired up down here, thank you.

205
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,300
 Yeah, he said, "It's not good for man to be alone."

206
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,460
 Like the first point of tonight's message is,

207
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,880
 you're called to community, called to community.

208
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,220
 God calls us to community.

209
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,420
 He said it, "It's not good for man to be alone."

210
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,860
 And I think the most natural way to apply this statement

211
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,020
 is to marriage, but I don't think it's just true

212
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,460
 about marriage, I think it's just true

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,660
 about life in general.

214
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,260
 It's not good for you and I to be alone,

215
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:27,100
 right now, in this moment, whether you're married or not.

216
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
 And you see this rhythm, like in Genesis one,

217
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,820
 one chapter before where God's creating

218
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,620
 and he says it's good, and he creates

219
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,620
 and he says it's good, and he does this six times

220
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,020
 over the course of six days,

221
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,180
 and on the seventh day, he rests.

222
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,500
 And so there's this incredible place of perfection,

223
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,780
 there's this paradise, and God just finished

224
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,300
 creating everything, and he created Adam,

225
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,180
 and sin hadn't come into existence yet,

226
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,340
 and Adam is ruling over everything that God created

227
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,900
 in this one-on-one harmonious relationship

228
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,740
 which is Adam and God.

229
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,740
 And it feels like there should be this amazing connection,

230
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,020
 but then something interrupts the creation story

231
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,660
 and God says what?

232
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,140
 He says it's not good for man to be alone.

233
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
 Like what could be wrong with perfection

234
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,100
 after God created?

235
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,340
 Being alone was the very first thing in all creation.

236
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,460
 I know I'm drilling down on this point,

237
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,660
 but we have to start here.

238
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,580
 This is the foundation in which we're building

239
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,300
 the entire message around tonight.

240
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,220
 I find this to be fascinating 'cause nothing is fallen yet.

241
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,260
 Everything is perfect, and you know,

242
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,340
 I talk to men every single week and they're just like,

243
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,220
 I'm good, man, just Jesus and I.

244
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,580
 Like I'm straight, like it's good,

245
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,340
 like him and I, I don't really need his people,

246
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,380
 I don't really need the church,

247
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,220
 and although that might sound good in theory,

248
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,760
 the Bible would just say that that's not true.

249
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,100
 It's not true.

250
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,140
 Psalm 92, 13 says those who are planted

251
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,580
 in the house of the Lord shall what?

252
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,820
 What's the promise there?

253
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,180
 It's not rhetorical.

254
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,740
 Shall what?

255
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,140
 Shall flourish.

256
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,960
 Do we have that up there?

257
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,020
 Yeah, shall flourish.

258
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,220
 And so the way that you and I flourish in this life

259
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,140
 is to be planted in the house of God,

260
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,860
 doing life, connected, embracing people

261
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,180
 that maybe don't look like you or dress like you,

262
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,700
 or have the same hobbies as you,

263
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,140
 but you know what they have?

264
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,580
 Point North is focused straight on Christ.

265
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,060
 It's this idea of solitary confinement.

266
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,900
 Like people in prison, man,

267
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,580
 they dread the punishment of solitary confinement.

268
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,000
 Like it's one of the worst things that you can do

269
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,140
 for a person in prison.

270
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,100
 Like one person said, being locked up in a place

271
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,200
 where you have zero human interaction with others

272
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,880
 literally psychologically destroys them.

273
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,340
 It cuts them off from the rest of the world.

274
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,260
 Another person said keeping prisoners totally isolated

275
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,540
 from the living world comes dangerously close

276
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,100
 to the penal tomb.

277
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,740
 In other words, it's a slow death.

278
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,580
 And listen, you know, you're not in a prison

279
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,320
 of solitary confinement tonight,

280
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,460
 but you might be in a prison of loneliness.

281
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,740
 You might be in a prison of anxiety, depression,

282
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,980
 pornography, alcohol, a prison of lying or cheating,

283
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,900
 or, you know, a prison of just gossiping.

284
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,740
 Like you just gossip because you just want

285
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,340
 to be elevated in this life.

286
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,020
 And when you do that, it just makes you look better

287
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,120
 than the other person.

288
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,100
 And I would just say,

289
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,660
 if we stay in those prisons

290
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,980
 and we never connect with God's people,

291
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,060
 then it's gonna be hard to get out.

292
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,860
 Here's the other truth in this room.

293
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,620
 Like some of us, we're just comfortable in that prison.

294
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,880
 Like we kind of like it.

295
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,400
 Like we've just grown numb to it.

296
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,960
 And it's just like what we do.

297
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,200
 And God said, it's not good.

298
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,640
 There's Proverbs 14, 12 says,

299
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,040
 "There's a way that seems right to man,

300
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,320
 "but that way ends in death."

301
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,680
 And some of you tonight, you don't even know it,

302
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,780
 but you're slowly dying.

303
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:21,560
 And God has you on this day, Valentine's 2023,

304
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,680
 to hear a message that hopefully might change

305
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,880
 the trajectory of your life for all of eternity.

306
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,600
 And not just all of eternity, but for now.

307
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,760
 Some of you are like, "Josiah, I got relationships.

308
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,880
 "I got the people in my life."

309
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,760
 But let me ask you something.

310
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,640
 Are they the right people?

311
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,800
 Are they the people that you can lock arms with

312
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,000
 that are gonna sharpen you and encourage you

313
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
 and challenge you in your faith?

314
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,260
 Bible says it like this in 2 Corinthians 6, 14,

315
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,020
 "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers.

316
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,160
 "For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?

317
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,280
 "Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?"

318
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,040
 So when the Bible says not to be yoked with unbelievers,

319
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,000
 it doesn't mean you quit spending time with unbelievers.

320
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,860
 Like that would be insanity.

321
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,880
 Like that would be impossible for you to, you know,

322
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,540
 share the gospel with them, point them to Christ,

323
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,480
 and just encourage and influence them.

324
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,960
 That's not what it's talking about, but it's saying,

325
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,420
 hey, where do you spend your closest time?

326
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,580
 And who do you spend your closest time with?

327
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,760
 Where are those places?

328
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,600
 Where are those people?

329
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,660
 And what kind of activities are you doing?

330
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,440
 Are they stirring your affection for Christ?

331
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,240
 Or are they drowning that out to a point where you just

332
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,880
 kind of said, hey, man, it is what it is.

333
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,080
 This is just life.

334
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,040
 And you're just kind of on the treadmill of stupidity.

335
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,360
 Like a dog returns to his vomit, the scripture says,

336
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,720
 a fool returns to his folly,

337
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,900
 and you have no one there to pick you up when you fall.

338
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,180
 You have no one there to be a truth teller.

339
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,580
 They just tell you what you want to hear.

340
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,080
 They don't tell you what you need to hear.

341
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,280
 22 years of my life, that's how I spent it.

342
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,720
 Here's what I know, man.

343
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,440
 The more we spend time with the wrong community,

344
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,680
 you catch the symptoms of those you run with.

345
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,600
 You tracking?

346
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,760
 Like you wonder why you can't defeat the sin in your life.

347
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,000
 It's because the people you hang out with entertain that.

348
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,320
 You wonder why you listen to what you listen to,

349
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,880
 you go where you go, you do what you do,

350
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,560
 you drink that, you smoke that,

351
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,880
 you hook up with that person,

352
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,680
 because that's just what you do.

353
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,700
 That's just your people.

354
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,160
 That's just who you guys hang out.

355
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,240
 That's what y'all, that's what you spend your time doing.

356
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,600
 And God's saying, "Hey, you keep doing what you're doing.

357
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,460
 "You're not gonna change.

358
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,500
 "But if you keep doing what you're doing,

359
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,200
 "you're not gonna like it at the end of the day.

360
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,840
 "It's gonna lead to bondage.

361
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,260
 "It's going to lead to death."

362
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,660
 Like I feel for some of you,

363
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,580
 because there's actually people trying to pursue

364
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,680
 the right kind of community,

365
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,780
 but part of the reason why your community

366
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,660
 might not be hitting right,

367
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,000
 because in 2023, it's harder and harder to know

368
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
 who's actually following Jesus.

369
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
 Like I like the Superbowl, man, it just makes it easy.

370
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,180
 Who's cheering for the Chiefs,

371
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,700
 who's cheering for the Eagles,

372
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,980
 or really any sport events, right?

373
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,680
 Because you got the jersey.

374
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
 I mean, I was repping that Patrick Mahomes,

375
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,840
 number 15 jersey, like let's go, right?

376
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,140
 And so that's just, man, I was repping that.

377
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,580
 Like people knew who I was cheering for, right?

378
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,740
 You know, people, like there's just so many distinctions.

379
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,400
 You got your chants, right?

380
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,800
 The city that you're from, or you know,

381
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,340
 whatever that thing is, there's just so many distinctions

382
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:57,340
 that separate people on who they're cheering for.

383
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,320
 But when it comes to the things of Christ,

384
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,040
 like it's just so blurry in 2023.

385
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,460
 You got the cultural Christianity,

386
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,680
 you got the soft preaching,

387
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,660
 you got people who won't share the hard truths of Scripture.

388
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,620
 And so people just think that they can continue

389
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,640
 to do what they're doing,

390
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,560
 and there's no ramifications for their sin.

391
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,020
 It's a mess.

392
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,860
 And God's saying, hey, there's hope.

393
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,280
 When you look at this book, it's your compass,

394
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,360
 it's your guide.

395
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,420
 Like you know what I'm talking about, man.

396
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,620
 You dated someone who said they're a Christian,

397
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,580
 and they were taking you out,

398
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,380
 but then they began to, you know,

399
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,340
 mismanage information about you,

400
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,180
 and they began to manipulate you,

401
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,220
 and they weren't the godly example

402
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,460
 that you thought they were, Bio's lie, right?

403
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,500
 Like you listen to what they said with their lips,

404
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,300
 but you didn't watch how they lived their life.

405
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,660
 And you're holding that against God.

406
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,540
 And God's like, man, you,

407
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,500
 greatest test of time is you just observing their life.

408
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,140
 Like that's the greatest test,

409
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,440
 is you watching their life over a period of time.

410
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,540
 You know that person that was lukewarm,

411
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,060
 and maybe he invited you to church,

412
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,180
 and you came to church, right?

413
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,140
 And you were kind of cold,

414
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,160
 like just kind of dead to the things of God,

415
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,340
 but then you started getting on fire for the things of God,

416
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,620
 and then you started calling out that person

417
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,860
 that was lukewarm, and they didn't like it, right?

418
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,020
 And you're like, man, why are you getting mad at me, bro?

419
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,980
 I'm just pointing you to the truth,

420
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,860
 the place that you brought me to.

421
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,220
 Or maybe you grew up in a family

422
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,020
 that sat in the pew Sunday after Sunday,

423
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,880
 but then when you jumped in the car,

424
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,660
 it was like all hell broke loose.

425
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,180
 Like, did you even hear what they were saying?

426
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,880
 And bro, it just sends you spiraling.

427
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,920
 2023, man, is a mess.

428
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,980
 It's hard to figure out who's in and who's not.

429
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,580
 It's getting harder and harder to know

430
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,260
 who's worth locking arms with, and I get that.

431
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,060
 So in 2023, here at The Porch, man,

432
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,340
 we've made a commitment to make a big place

433
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,380
 feel really, really small.

434
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,060
 Like, we wanna help filter the people

435
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,480
 that wanna go all in and still create a space

436
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,860
 for people to come examine the evidence of Christ

437
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,660
 and love the people that aren't fully bought in

438
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,260
 and wanna commit their life to Jesus.

439
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,620
 Like, that will always be what marks The Porch,

440
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,040
 but we also wanna create a place

441
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,140
 for people who wants to go all in,

442
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,060
 and so what we do is we stand up here every week,

443
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,000
 and we just said, hey, there's gonna be a team of people

444
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,220
 down here up front in the front of the stage

445
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,140
 that would love to talk to you,

446
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,300
 whether you're a skeptic

447
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,200
 or whether you're a seasoned believer.

448
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,660
 We've created another environment up in the loft.

449
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,140
 You just go up the town center,

450
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,660
 go up the stairs in the loft, and it's called Next Steps,

451
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,380
 and that's just a place to help you discover

452
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,100
 what is your next step, community, serving, membership,

453
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,020
 and then there's a process where you can go

454
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,480
 and you can meet other men or other women

455
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,820
 that are pursuing the same thing you're pursuing

456
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,500
 and want to gather with other women

457
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,380
 in a smaller group or other men in a smaller group

458
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,180
 and wanna start doing life together.

459
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,700
 That's community, and then it's like,

460
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,260
 do we have a really easy win every week

461
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,680
 is up in the chapel, where it's like,

462
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,560
 you go up these stairs, go out those doors,

463
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,220
 and there's the chapel, and it's just a place

464
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,620
 for you to process what you just heard and pray,

465
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,620
 and so there's a lot of different connecting points

466
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,140
 no matter where you find yourself.

467
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,400
 Once a month, we got great questions

468
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,940
 where you can go and ask anything.

469
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,020
 Nothing's off limits, and we'll do our best to answer that,

470
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,900
 and so this is our heart here at the porch

471
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,260
 that we wanna help get you connected.

472
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,500
 God is calling you to community, and tonight is the night.

473
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,020
 I believe some of you will step into that

474
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,180
 and experience life and life abundantly.

475
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,660
 Point number two, if you're taking notes,

476
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,020
 call to confess.

477
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,020
 You're called to confess.

478
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,960
 Like, this is what marks people that are in community,

479
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,480
 so if you're like, man, I'm in community,

480
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,420
 and as I'm going throughout this message,

481
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,540
 you don't hear these things actually playing out

482
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,860
 in your life, let's talk after the service.

483
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,140
 I'll be down here as long as it takes.

484
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,380
 First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins,

485
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,820
 "he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins

486
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,620
 "and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

487
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,100
 I love that.

488
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,860
 Like, nobody can out-sin the grace of God.

489
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,540
 It doesn't matter where you've been, what you've done.

490
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,780
 Oh, you don't know my story, just saying,

491
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,140
 oh, you don't know my story.

492
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,780
 No, if you confess your sin, he's faithful and just

493
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,400
 to forgive you of all your sin

494
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,740
 and cleanse you of all unrighteousness.

495
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,060
 That's your vertical relationship with Jesus.

496
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,740
 I love Psalm 32, three through five.

497
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,580
 It just says, "When I kept silent, my bones wasted away

498
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,660
 "through my groaning all day long."

499
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,540
 It's like, hey, man, when you keep silent

500
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,360
 and you suppress your sin and you don't confess it,

501
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,700
 like, your body gets sick.

502
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,980
 I mean, that's just, I'm just reading the text.

503
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,900
 That sounds right.

504
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,620
 I mean, I think that's what it says.

505
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,780
 Verse four, "For day and night, your hand," whose hand?

506
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,580
 "God's hand was heavy upon me.

507
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,860
 "My strength was dried up as by the heat of the summer."

508
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,400
 But then it says in verse five, look at their term.

509
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,780
 "I acknowledged my sin to you."

510
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,980
 I didn't cover my iniquity, my sin.

511
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,940
 I said, "I will confess my transgression to the Lord

512
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,100
 "and you forgave the iniquity of my sin."

513
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,220
 You know, let me ask, like, have you prayed

514
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,980
 and asked God to forgive you of your sin?

515
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,020
 Like, have you recognized,

516
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,140
 if there have been a time in your life

517
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,340
 where you recognize, hey, that you are a sinner

518
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,540
 separated from a holy, perfect God,

519
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,680
 there's no one righteous, not one.

520
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,820
 The only thing you need to come to God is need.

521
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,280
 Like, so often, we don't even realize we have a need.

522
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,940
 If you're like me, man, I just compared my life

523
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,340
 to other people, even people in the church,

524
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,020
 and when I did that, I could always find someone worse

525
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,380
 than me, which gave me security in the fact that I was,

526
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,740
 gave me security in the fact that I wasn't that bad.

527
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,220
 And so I just kind of did whatever I wanted.

528
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,260
 I can always find someone worse than you.

529
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,100
 You know, that's the mentality

530
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,960
 that some of us have in this place.

531
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,460
 And God's saying, "Hey, man, there's no one righteous,

532
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:24,120
 "no, not one, but my grace is sufficient.

533
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,720
 "My grace can cover that."

534
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,540
 Like, some of us, man, we've confessed our sin to God,

535
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,580
 but we're still not experiencing the healing,

536
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,580
 the victory that comes with that.

537
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,980
 Like, we've done the vertical relationship with God,

538
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,420
 but outside of that, man,

539
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,040
 we have not confessed that to anyone else.

540
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,960
 Like, we haven't experienced the true healing.

541
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,320
 Like, we've experienced forgiveness,

542
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,980
 but I always say forgiveness and healing

543
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,820
 are two different things.

544
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,660
 Like, forgiveness is what you get in 1 John 1:9 in Psalm 32,

545
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,700
 but healing, look what it says in James 5:16.

546
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,220
 Therefore, confess your sins one to another.

547
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,300
 That's vertical, or excuse me, that's horizontal.

548
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,660
 That's not vertical, it's horizontal relationships,

549
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,020
 and pray for one another that you may be what?

550
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,620
 Come on, what's the promise?

551
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,200
 Healed.

552
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,040
 Healed.

553
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,140
 The prayer of a righteous person has great power

554
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,140
 as it is working.

555
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,100
 See, the best version of you and I exists

556
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,540
 on the other side of community, the most healed,

557
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,940
 the most whole version of you and I exists

558
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,720
 on the other side of community.

559
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,320
 It's where you share and confess those dark areas

560
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,220
 of your heart.

561
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,700
 So many Christians are forgiven of their sin

562
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,740
 because they pray and ask Jesus to forgive them

563
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,660
 of their sin, but they're not walking in full heal,

564
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,140
 healness, they're not walking in complete victory

565
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,420
 because they've suppressed their sin

566
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,200
 instead of addressing it, instead of sharing that

567
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,200
 with people that are either men of integrity

568
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,420
 or women of integrity, either men that can be trusted

569
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,580
 or women that can be trusted.

570
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,080
 Do you have that in your life?

571
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,460
 There's some of us that we know this to be true.

572
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,460
 Like we have made a declaration to ourself

573
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,820
 that there's things in our life that were taken

574
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,620
 to the grave and I'm not going to let anyone

575
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,220
 know about that thing.

576
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,220
 And God's saying, okay, well then it's going to be

577
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,900
 really hard for you to experience complete healing.

578
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,140
 There's things that you said, I'm just going to go

579
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,380
 to the grave and I'm not going to let anyone know about it.

580
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,460
 And I would just say, hey, the power of sin

581
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,140
 is always in secrecy.

582
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,100
 If you want sin's power to weaken,

583
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,980
 then you'll begin to confess it.

584
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,800
 That's what he's called us to do tonight

585
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,080
 is to confess that sin one to another.

586
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,820
 The power of sin grows strength when it's suppressed,

587
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,740
 when it's in darkness.

588
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,620
 But if you want that sin to be weakened,

589
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,660
 then you'll confess it.

590
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,180
 Several months ago, my wife, Kathy and I,

591
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,820
 when you saw in the picture, we got in a pretty big

592
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,580
 argument, like we just, you know, we weren't seeing eye

593
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,820
 to eye with some things and, you know,

594
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,260
 we weren't necessarily angry at one another.

595
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,620
 And the Bible says, do not let the sun go down

596
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,060
 in your anger, but it doesn't say, hey,

597
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,380
 you can't let the sun go down on your conflict, right?

598
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,500
 So I was like, all right, man, we just need to go to bed.

599
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,340
 Right?

600
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,160
 So we're just going to go to bed.

601
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,700
 We'll put this on the shelf and we'll come back

602
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,120
 and address this tomorrow morning.

603
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,820
 So she goes to bed and I kind of, you know,

604
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,700
 stewing a little bit.

605
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,000
 I'm not angry, I'm just frustrated that we,

606
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,220
 that we're just in this conflict.

607
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,380
 We can't, we can't seem to get eye to eye.

608
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,620
 We can't seem to talk and to work through it

609
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,680
 and to be like-minded in this issue.

610
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,780
 And so in that moment, I just felt tempted

611
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,620
 to look at pornography.

612
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,340
 Like the temptation became so strong in that moment.

613
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,700
 And I had a choice.

614
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,780
 I could pick up my phone and I could text out the men

615
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,580
 that I've been talking about tonight that,

616
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,020
 that, hey, I gather with and I can say,

617
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,380
 hey, hey fellas, listen, listen, listen.

618
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,060
 There's this temptation that's come over me.

619
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,500
 I know what I need to do.

620
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,360
 I need to flee it, but, but it's,

621
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,580
 but I'm fighting it right now.

622
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,260
 And I, and I, and I want to click on that.

623
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,380
 I want to go to that website.

624
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,760
 I want to go to this social media handle.

625
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,700
 So I'm sure you're already sleeping, but when you see this,

626
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,020
 well, you asked me when you wake up,

627
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,860
 if I won the battle tomorrow morning,

628
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,140
 and I reconciled with my wife and by God's grace,

629
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,340
 I won the battle over lust, porn.

630
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,840
 And by God's grace, we reconciled with my wife.

631
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,200
 You know what it did in that moment with my wife?

632
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,220
 You know what it did in that moment?

633
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,260
 It, sin's power began to weaken.

634
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,260
 But the moment that you decide, hey,

635
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,140
 I'm just going to kind of fight this on my own.

636
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,580
 And I got this.

637
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,020
 You're done, man.

638
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,860
 You're toast.

639
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,440
 Like some of us, like we just wait to confess things

640
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,660
 on an action level when God's saying, no, no, no.

641
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,860
 It starts with your mind.

642
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,140
 Sow a thought, reap an action.

643
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,340
 Sow an action, reap a habit.

644
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,660
 Sow a habit, reap character.

645
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,700
 Sow character, reap an entire destiny.

646
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,100
 The battle is always in the mind.

647
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,300
 So what would it look like if thousands of young adults

648
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,300
 all over the nation that are listening to this tonight

649
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,340
 decided, hey, I'm not just going to confess

650
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,180
 on the action level.

651
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,500
 I'm going to start confessing on a thought level

652
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,220
 when the temptation hits me.

653
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,740
 Do you have men like that?

654
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,700
 Do you have women like that?

655
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,980
 And some of you are like, man, I ain't doing that.

656
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,380
 Like, you don't know, bro.

657
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,680
 Like people are going to mismanage that information about me.

658
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,260
 And I'm just like, well, hey, let them.

659
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,360
 Because you're not defined by people.

660
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,900
 You're defined by the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.

661
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,140
 And my Bible says that there is therefore now

662
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,580
 no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus.

663
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,940
 And so I can confess it.

664
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,080
 Even in this moment, I'm like, man,

665
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,160
 what are they going to think about me?

666
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,260
 The pastor boy, he's got temptations

667
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,340
 to look at things, I don't really care.

668
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:55,580
 Because the power is always weakened

669
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,200
 when you address the sin.

670
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,140
 And so you have a chance tonight

671
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,680
 to have sin's power weakened.

672
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,260
 Galatians 1.10 says, am I trying to win the approval of men

673
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,100
 or of God?

674
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,940
 If I was trying to win the approval of men,

675
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,140
 I'd never be a servant of Christ.

676
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,660
 I'm not trying to win your approval.

677
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,640
 I'm not trying to win other people's approval,

678
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
 even my community group's approval.

679
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,820
 But by faith, I step out, I send the text.

680
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,540
 Even if I would have gone and fell into that sin,

681
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,700
 I know how they're going to respond.

682
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,340
 They're going to extend grace and say,

683
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,140
 all right, Josiah, let's talk.

684
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,060
 Let me remind you of Romans 8.1.

685
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,620
 You don't have to live with condemnation.

686
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,220
 You don't have to live with shame and guilt

687
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,740
 because Christ defeated that when he died on the cross

688
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,700
 and rose again on the third day.

689
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,700
 That's the power that is available to you and me.

690
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,540
 Do you have that power?

691
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,180
 Do you have those men?

692
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,940
 Do you have those women in your life?

693
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,000
 Tonight's the night where you remove the mask

694
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,980
 and you show your true self.

695
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,280
 Like, listen, we come into this place

696
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,880
 and we're wearing masks.

697
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,220
 Like they're invisible, of course,

698
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,300
 but they're a mask nonetheless.

699
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,580
 The mask represents hiding.

700
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,620
 It represents shame.

701
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,740
 It represents, I don't want people to see

702
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,780
 that area of my life.

703
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,420
 And I'm just saying, hey, if you don't remove that tonight,

704
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,820
 it's going to be hard for you to walk in victory.

705
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,980
 It's going to be hard for you to experience freedom

706
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,440
 that Christ is offering.

707
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,660
 The mask that I'm not wearing is the four other men

708
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,540
 in my life that I pursue and they pursue me

709
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,740
 every single week.

710
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,300
 These are men that I've grown to love because they know me

711
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,100
 and they still love the real me.

712
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,680
 No matter where I've been in thought, word and action,

713
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,380
 they open up this book and they say,

714
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,140
 hey, lust, I got a verse for that.

715
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,420
 I got a battle plan for that.

716
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,540
 Anxiety, I got a battle plan for that.

717
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,280
 Oh, you got a big decision that you need to make?

718
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,980
 I got a verse for that.

719
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,220
 I got a game plan for that.

720
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,820
 Oh, you're struggling with anger.

721
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,100
 Oh, your tone at home,

722
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,100
 that your posture towards your wife and your kids.

723
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,420
 Hey, I got some verses for that.

724
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,140
 And the more and more they just remind me of God's word

725
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,420
 and it gets in my mind and it gets in my heart

726
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,000
 and then it just begins to ooze out of you.

727
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,060
 But some of us tonight, man,

728
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,360
 we're not hiding the word of God in our heart.

729
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,280
 We're saying I'm too busy.

730
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,300
 But look at the time you spend on your phone.

731
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,140
 You know, those smartphones can track it now.

732
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,420
 And I'm not here to shame you, man.

733
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,740
 I had to do the same thing 'cause I was making excuses

734
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,440
 for not spending time with the Lord, for not praying.

735
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,140
 If you're too busy to be a Christian, man, you're too busy.

736
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,660
 God's calling some of you to step up,

737
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,420
 to draw a line in the sand, nail stake in the ground.

738
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,940
 Tonight's the night you find community.

739
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,500
 Tonight's the night you become fully known.

740
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,900
 I like what Tim Keller says.

741
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,140
 He says, "To be loved but not known

742
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,820
 is comforting but superficial."

743
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:21,820
 To be known and not loved is our greatest fear.

744
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,700
 But to be fully loved, excuse me,

745
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,600
 but to be fully known and truly loved,

746
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,240
 well, it's a lot like being loved by God.

747
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,360
 The men in my life are some of the greatest expressions

748
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,680
 of God's love for me in a real tangible way.

749
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,360
 Those four men that I meet with, I see Christ in them.

750
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,440
 It's like, "Where's Christ, man?

751
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,440
 Why can't I see God?"

752
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
 You got community?

753
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,540
 You got people in your life that are in the trenches

754
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,400
 with you, that are responding to you

755
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,160
 in a way that's gonna point you to Christ

756
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,480
 and not make excuses for your sin,

757
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,320
 but they tell you the hard things.

758
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,220
 And they say, "Come on, let's go.

759
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,120
 I got you."

760
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,960
 (smacks lips)

761
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,400
 Proverbs 28, 13 says,

762
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,280
 "Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,

763
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,700
 but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy."

764
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,020
 You know, the secret to life

765
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,480
 is to live a life without secrets.

766
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,540
 Why?

767
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,840
 Because it brings healing and mercy.

768
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,300
 Do you want healing tonight?

769
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,600
 Do you want mercy tonight?

770
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,880
 You might be asking, "Joseph, how does this look like?"

771
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,200
 Well, I tried to share with you.

772
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,160
 Let me just kind of go one step deeper.

773
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,000
 I'm not saying you gotta go before 10 people

774
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,880
 and confess your sin.

775
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,560
 I'm like, "Hey, do you know someone

776
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,400
 who's a, if you're a lady in the room,

777
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
 she's a strong woman of God,

778
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,080
 that you can pick up the phone and you can call.

779
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,960
 If you're a guy, you know a strong man of God,

780
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,520
 just one person that you can just begin to walk this out

781
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,500
 and flesh this out.

782
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,320
 And you might not be able to give all the details.

783
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,640
 Like you gotta start somewhere, right?

784
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,600
 You gotta build trust somewhere,

785
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
 but you gotta go first in this.

786
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,360
 If you're waiting for community to find you,

787
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,840
 it's not gonna find you, you gotta find it.

788
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,080
 You gotta pursue it.

789
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,940
 And you just pick up the phone and you just say,

790
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,640
 "Hey, I've been looking at that two-dimensional image.

791
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,200
 I can't give you all the details, but there I said it.

792
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,760
 Hey, listen, I've been overeating and under eating

793
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,080
 because life, my life just feels out of control.

794
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,720
 It's the one thing I can control.

795
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,240
 Hey, I've been managing information.

796
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,440
 Haven't been being honest with you.

797
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,440
 I've lied to your face plenty of times there I said it.

798
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,840
 Hey, I was literally heading to the strip club tonight."

799
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,660
 I mean, maybe this is one of your stories.

800
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,440
 Maybe you go there weekly

801
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,820
 because your greatest desire is to be wanted.

802
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,140
 Your greatest desire is to be pursued,

803
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,280
 but you took that detour and you came to the porch tonight.

804
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,780
 You just need to confess that.

805
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,920
 I don't know what your thing is,

806
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,200
 but you just need to go first and you need to say,

807
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,880
 "Hey, I need help.

808
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,520
 I need to get this off my chest.

809
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,960
 I need to start doing life with people

810
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,200
 that are gonna love me for who I am,

811
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,240
 but are gonna love me enough

812
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,760
 to not allow me to stay in that thing."

813
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,740
 God calls us to confess our sin,

814
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,080
 to carry each other's burdens, to pray for each other.

815
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,320
 We have trusted friends that come alongside of you

816
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,120
 and help you fight against your sin.

817
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,920
 Proverbs 18, one says,

818
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,600
 "Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire."

819
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,280
 In other words, it's the opposite

820
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,120
 of what we're talking about.

821
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,520
 You just kind of do your own thing, you go your own way.

822
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,520
 And it's like, you just want your desires.

823
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,780
 Okay, you just told us you just want your desires.

824
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,120
 But then look at the next part.

825
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,280
 He breaks out against all sound judgment.

826
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,760
 You don't even have wisdom now.

827
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,880
 I can't tell you how many times I've showed up

828
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
 on a Friday morning at 6 a.m.

829
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,360
 And I've just said, "Hey, I don't know what to do with X."

830
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,080
 Whether it's a sin struggle or a big decision

831
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,320
 or financial insecurities.

832
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,440
 And I just said, "Guys, I need help."

833
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,920
 And they begin to walk with me

834
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,420
 and point me to the truth of God's word.

835
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,580
 Like some of you tonight, man,

836
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,200
 God is also saying like,

837
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,520
 "Hey, it's not good to be alone in the crowd."

838
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,360
 Like you might think, "I'm not alone,"

839
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,080
 because you have something to belong to.

840
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,200
 But belonging has to do with becoming fully known.

841
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,680
 Like you might think, "Hey, you're belonging

842
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,140
 because you do that CrossFit thing

843
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,600
 or SoulCycle or barre classes."

844
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,120
 Like my wife, man, she loves that barre stuff.

845
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,560
 I don't even get it, man.

846
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,280
 It's like a whole nother world.

847
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,400
 I'm like, "Body weight?

848
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,440
 Nah, I'm out."

849
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,000
 You know, and then she shows me some exercise

850
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,560
 and your boy can't even do them, right?

851
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,620
 But that's neither here nor there.

852
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,720
 But people just think they're belonging to something

853
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,360
 because they're a part of just that activity

854
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,800
 or it's the happy hour thing.

855
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,560
 But people don't know the real you.

856
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,920
 And here's why it's not good.

857
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,600
 Because you and I will never be fully loved

858
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,160
 until we're fully known.

859
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,760
 It's what Tim Kelly was saying.

860
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,740
 And it's liberating, man, to be fully known,

861
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,720
 but then also to be fully loved.

862
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:27,200
 Some of us, man, we've gotten so comfortable

863
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,480
 in just showing this false view of ourself.

864
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,600
 Like we just, we're hanging out with these people

865
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,580
 and they don't know you.

866
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,000
 And so it's just the false version of you.

867
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,880
 And it's not good.

868
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,400
 It's not how you were created.

869
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,700
 It's not how, it's not what you were made for.

870
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,480
 And I'm just thinking like,

871
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,440
 what would it look like tonight if we took this serious?

872
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,120
 What would it look like in 2023 if we took this serious?

873
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,840
 Like if we created a place where we could truly

874
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,000
 be fully loved as we were being fully known

875
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,300
 no matter where we'd been.

876
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,880
 I don't get scared, man.

877
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,560
 The world doesn't operate like this.

878
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,400
 The world has performance-based acceptance.

879
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,520
 You do this and then I'll accept you.

880
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,480
 And the gospel is the way different.

881
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
 It's acceptance-based performance.

882
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,440
 God's accepted you right where you are.

883
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,900
 We've accepted you right where you are.

884
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,040
 Not so that you go perform,

885
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,200
 but so that you would experience the love

886
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,240
 and the intimacy of Christ and his church and his people.

887
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,600
 I want that for you tonight.

888
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,160
 God wants that for you tonight.

889
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,400
 This is my story, man.

890
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,260
 Jesus got ahold of me as I was wrapping up college

891
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,180
 and my life came to a screeching halt, man.

892
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,200
 Everything I'd worked so hard for was falling,

893
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,540
 you know, starting to fall into place.

894
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,840
 I was playing college baseball

895
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,040
 and, you know, just thinking I had life by the coattails.

896
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,960
 And I remember finishing up a game

897
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,160
 and going back to my apartment that night

898
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,020
 and I just asked the question, is that it?

899
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,240
 'Cause if these things aren't gonna do it anymore,

900
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,080
 what's gonna do it?

901
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,580
 And sin was just ruling my life.

902
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,600
 And I finally saw my sin for what it was

903
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,620
 in light of a holy God.

904
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,180
 I always say, hey, you'll never appreciate

905
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,600
 the cross of Jesus Christ.

906
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,000
 You'll never sing loud.

907
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,160
 You'll never get on mission.

908
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,560
 You'll never open up this Bible

909
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,920
 if you don't really see your need

910
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,120
 for what he's done for you.

911
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,340
 And I finally had lived enough life

912
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,500
 to know that life is broken apart from him.

913
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,240
 And the God of the Bible stepped out of heaven

914
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,900
 and said, I'm gonna stoop down and become a servant.

915
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,320
 You tell me another religion out there that does that.

916
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,360
 There isn't one, man.

917
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,560
 That's what separates Christianity from all other religions.

918
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,060
 And so God met me all in my mess,

919
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,920
 a 10-year battle of porn,

920
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,360
 taking advantage of one woman after another

921
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,520
 and the life of the party and alcohol and drugs

922
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,800
 and you name it.

923
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,760
 And he just said, Josiah, I want you.

924
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,200
 I want you to experience life, man.

925
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,680
 These manic highs and these manic lows that you have,

926
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,080
 man, none of that anymore.

927
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,080
 I got you, man.

928
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,680
 I've given you a roadmap.

929
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,940
 Follow me, trust me.

930
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,300
 It's not gonna be easy, but I got you, man.

931
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:20,320
 You can be forgiven, set free, healed, and walk

932
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,160
 in all that you were made to walk in.

933
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,920
 And you'll be purposed.

934
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,120
 You'll have purpose.

935
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,920
 Purpose will mark your life.

936
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,080
 Not just this silly game that's gonna end someday.

937
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,460
 Not just making a million dollars by the time you're 30.

938
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,880
 I didn't do that, by the way.

939
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,000
 But you know what I'm saying?

940
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,600
 I went into ministry, help me.

941
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,820
 But God has given me this purpose, man,

942
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,260
 that is way bigger,

943
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,840
 that's gonna outlast anything in this world.

944
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,320
 And I love my people that are in the business world,

945
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,280
 and you're hustling, that's awesome, man, do it.

946
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,340
 But for whose glory?

947
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,180
 For your own?

948
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,600
 Man, that's a dead-end road, bro.

949
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,240
 It ain't gonna last.

950
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,240
 And so God began to show me that He was calling me

951
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,900
 from that life, He was calling me to Himself,

952
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,960
 and I began to learn that, hey,

953
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,320
 God never calls you from something

954
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,480
 without calling you to something.

955
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,400
 And what He called me to

956
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,680
 was to change my playground and my playmates.

957
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,040
 He called me out of those playgrounds

958
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,720
 and those playmates, and not just to ostracize them.

959
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,920
 A lot of them were my closest boys, man, I love them.

960
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,760
 But I just said, hey, guys,

961
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,600
 I can't just be going back to those old stopping grounds,

962
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,400
 man, we can still hang,

963
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,480
 but I'm gonna be telling you about Jesus,

964
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,600
 you can tell me about what you do,

965
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,000
 but I'm gonna be telling you about Jesus,

966
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,360
 so if you can accept me for who I am, let's go.

967
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,160
 And God just began to change my life,

968
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,800
 and the people that I spent my quality time with,

969
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,060
 the majority of my time with were like-minded people.

970
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,320
 Do you have that tonight?

971
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,860
 Last and final truth,

972
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:56,200
 God's calling you to commit, called to commit.

973
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,440
 Tonight's the night.

974
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,200
 People come up to me all the time and say,

975
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
 man, I feel like your story is my story.

976
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,600
 What'd you do?

977
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,520
 I said, apart from the grace of God,

978
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:16,040
 I went all in with men that said they wanted to be about it.

979
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,520
 I'm not talking about people

980
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,280
 that just wanna check the Tuesday night box,

981
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,920
 or the Sunday morning box.

982
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,380
 I'm talking about people that were real.

983
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,480
 They struggled with sin, but they struggled well.

984
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,400
 They didn't just sit back and make life about them,

985
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,120
 they served.

986
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,800
 I was 31 when I got married.

987
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,520
 Do you think I forgot what it's like to be single?

988
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,640
 Year after year, eight Valentine's days passed by,

989
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,040
 and your boy was single.

990
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,800
 Tears and laying in bed at night,

991
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,440
 thinking God, what, is this is how it's gonna be?

992
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,000
 I can go get a woman.

993
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,680
 He's like, that's not the kind of women you want, Josiah.

994
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,160
 Okay, okay, all right.

995
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,360
 Center me, center me.

996
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,660
 Bring me back to reality.

997
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,520
 And God just started showing me, man,

998
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,180
 that this is where life is found.

999
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,180
 That following Him is adventurous, man.

1000
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,540
 If you got some crazy idea

1001
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,860
 of what it looks like to follow Christ,

1002
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,140
 and you just sing songs and listen to messages,

1003
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,220
 and you never do anything with it, man, you're crazy, man.

1004
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,540
 Just go back to the Porch Podcast archive

1005
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,220
 and listen to the messages.

1006
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:39,220
 This life is way different than my BC days before Christ.

1007
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,860
 More joy.

1008
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,140
 So I locked it in with men that wanted to go all in,

1009
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,860
 and they walked with me through the highest of highs,

1010
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,420
 the lowest of lows.

1011
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,980
 The destructive divorce that plagued me

1012
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,400
 and had anger and bitterness in my heart for years,

1013
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,600
 they began to unpack that layer by layer by layer.

1014
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,900
 The stage four cancer that my sister-in-law went through,

1015
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,220
 they began to walk with me through that.

1016
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,860
 Like, what is the world's solution to those problems,

1017
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,700
 to those pains?

1018
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,860
 Ah, let's go get a six pack or a 12, let's go to the bar,

1019
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,620
 let's go numb ourself, come on.

1020
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,120
 You know there ain't no life there,

1021
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,140
 and you keep lying to yourself week in and week out.

1022
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:33,660
 And they began to give me real solutions

1023
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,540
 for real problems that I was going through.

1024
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,980
 When I lost one of my best friends

1025
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,340
 in a tragic plane accident,

1026
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,940
 they showed up.

1027
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:47,380
 When I finally got married, come on somebody,

1028
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,300
 they celebrated me.

1029
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,540
 When I had my first child, they were there.

1030
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,660
 They showed up for me, man, in the highest of highs

1031
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,040
 and the lowest of lows.

1032
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,460
 Call to commit.

1033
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,060
 Tonight's the night that many of you,

1034
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:10,060
 you pass from this world of superficial,

1035
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:15,180
 lacking depth of relationship,

1036
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:20,740
 to truly going all in, not just with Christ,

1037
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,800
 but with his people.

1038
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,180
 And I always wonder, man, what my life would look like

1039
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,140
 if I never went all in with his people.

1040
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,980
 I always wonder, I'm like, man, what would my life look like?

1041
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,640
 Like, would I still be living in my parents' house,

1042
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,440
 playing video games at an unhealthy level?

1043
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,260
 Like just maybe at a tailgate,

1044
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,820
 Dallas Cowboys in the parking lot,

1045
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,020
 talking about how I never made it drunk.

1046
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:54,040
 Just addicted to pornography,

1047
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,940
 addicted to myself, just a poser,

1048
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,500
 like just telling people one thing and doing another.

1049
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,600
 I always wonder, what would your life look like?

1050
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:14,040
 What would your life look like if you never stepped out

1051
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,760
 in what we talked about tonight?

1052
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,560
 Like there's a countdown right here.

1053
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:23,440
 That's a long time, it feels like, but that's just a year.

1054
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,720
 Like if Jesus showed up a year from tonight

1055
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,320
 or three weeks ago, four weeks ago,

1056
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,760
 when we launched the porch, is he gonna be cool

1057
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,260
 with just like, oh, just me and Jesus, just me and you?

1058
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,860
 Or is he gonna be like, man, what?

1059
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,360
 I've given you a church, man, I've given you people.

1060
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,540
 What are you gonna do with it?

1061
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,700
 You're gonna go all in?

1062
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:53,560
 A call to community, a call to be fully known.

1063
00:46:53,560 --> 00:47:00,400
 And lastly, a call to commit.

1064
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,680
 Let me pray that you would tonight.

1065
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,380
 God in heaven, go before my friends.

1066
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,900
 There's nothing I say or said

1067
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:15,420
 that can change the trajectory of their heart

1068
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,420
 and the trajectory of their life.

1069
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:23,940
 Would you help the unbelief that plagues this room?

1070
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,780
 And would you turn that into belief?

1071
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:33,180
 Would you help the fears and the insecurities

1072
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,660
 that we have to step into a community

1073
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,120
 that we talked about tonight?

1074
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,260
 And would they just go all in?

1075
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:47,740
 And would they experience the richness of your blessings

1076
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,460
 through the tangible expressions of grace and mercy

1077
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,100
 and peace and love and wisdom and discernment

1078
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,720
 that your people are marked by?

1079
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,580
 And no matter what kind of experience they've had

1080
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,980
 growing up in the church

1081
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,140
 or even in their young adult years, God,

1082
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,220
 would they continue to pursue it?

1083
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,140
 And would they continue to pursue you?

1084
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:18,300
 And God, would you meet them where they are

1085
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,580
 for your glory, our joy, and the world's good.

1086
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,380
 It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
