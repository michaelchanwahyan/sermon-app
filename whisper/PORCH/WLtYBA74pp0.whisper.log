[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   He hit a full woohoo.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.240]   What's your name, bro?
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.560]   Who said woohoo?
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.400]   It was you?
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.080]   What's your name?
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.400]   Jesus?
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.120]   I appreciate that enthusiasm, bro.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.360]   I appreciate that.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.000]   Like he said, I'm Tripp.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500]   I'm excited to get to be here and serve you.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.360]   Have y'all been having a good time so far?
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.040]   (audience cheers)
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.720]   Good, well, I'm gonna open God's word,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.560]   but before we do that, I just wanna pray one more time,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.760]   ask God for his help.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.880]   Father, we come before you again
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.400]   in the name of your son, Jesus.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.280]   We come in the name of Jesus, Father,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.480]   because that's how we can approach you,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.560]   is through your son.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.920]   And Father, we pray that as we spend this time in your word
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.560]   that you would speak to us, God.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.680]   God, we pray this wouldn't be
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.520]   just time where we just hear some opinions from a person,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.420]   Father, we need to hear authoritative truth from you.
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.840]   Father, I pray for my friends in this room
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.080]   whose hearts and minds are all over the place, Father,
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.480]   that you would help our hearts and minds
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.720]   to find rest and peace in you, Father.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.280]   Father, if we're close-handed, Father,
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.960]   if we are defensive, I pray you would help us
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.160]   to open our hands to hear from you,
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.760]   say whatever you call us to, Lord,
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.200]   that's what we wanna do.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.680]   Help us to see you clearly, we ask in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.360]   Amen.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.960]   Again, I'm excited to be here.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.560]   I met Jesus when I was a teenager.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.920]   And before that, for me, I was a little confused
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.720]   about what it meant to be a Christian
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.720]   because I grew up around, I just grew up in an environment
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.200]   where everybody said they were Christians.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.520]   I knew people who went to church,
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.800]   every Sunday said they were Christians,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   people who never went to church
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.640]   and said they were Christians,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.880]   people who lived these moral lives
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.720]   and said they were Christians,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.160]   people who lived these immoral lives
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.060]   and said they were Christians.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.840]   I was just confused about what it meant to be a Christian.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.200]   And I even repeated a prayer after children's pastor
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.360]   when I was real little.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.960]   It was one of them things where I got dragged
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.120]   to children's church with my family.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.320]   You know, and I don't remember how often we went.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.400]   I didn't go enough to know all the hand motions
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   the kids were doing while singing songs.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.320]   I'll just say that.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.260]   And so whatever you do in children's church,
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.720]   after we did that, color pictures,
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.640]   the animals on Noah's Ark, whatever we did,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.800]   you know, the children's pastor was like,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.920]   "Hey, kids, do you wanna go to heaven
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.560]   "where you will get to live forever,
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.220]   "probably get to see any of your relatives that passed away.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.980]   "You can ask Jesus what happened to the dinosaurs,
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.160]   "then you can ride on the back of a cheetah,
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.500]   "probably teleport,
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.320]   "and play one-on-one basketball with Jesus forever.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.880]   "Or do you wanna go to hell where you'll burn forever?"
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.520]   And I was like, "Oh my goodness."
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.480]   First one sounded better.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.360]   So like I just repeated after me,
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.600]   repeated this prayer after him.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.160]   God, God, my bad, my bad.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160]   You know, all the sinners prayer things.
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.220]   And you know, I don't think I became a Christian that day
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.020]   because even though I was repeating these words
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.380]   about putting my faith in Jesus,
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.100]   I didn't understand who Jesus was.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.960]   I didn't understand how holy God was.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.800]   I didn't understand why I needed to trust in Jesus
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.060]   to be forgiven of sins.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.260]   None of that clicked.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.000]   Fast forward, God and his providence.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.500]   You know, I got dragged to church again
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.900]   when I was a little older.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.860]   And you know, it was a sign up for a youth summer retreat.
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.420]   And I sat on the line, I was like,
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.100]   "I am not gonna sign up for that."
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.760]   And I looked over there, there was some cute girls in line.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.800]   I'm like, "I'm gonna go sign up for that."
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.880]   And I did.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.460]   And though I had bad intentions, God had better ones.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.520]   Because as I started to go to this youth group,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.700]   I had a good youth pastor.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.160]   It was me, we didn't only do fun stuff,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.940]   he also opened up the Bible and preached
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.760]   the gospel of Jesus.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.580]   And I heard about this Jesus,
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.580]   and all the stuff that hadn't clicked to me before
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.440]   about how holy God was,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.140]   the ways I had separated myself from him,
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.500]   what it meant for Jesus to sacrifice himself for me,
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.780]   and the fact that I just wasn't a good Lord of my life.
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.780]   You know, not only did I not keep his laws,
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.940]   I didn't even keep my own.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.400]   You ever been like, "I'm done with them,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   "I'm never gonna talk to them again."
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.220]   And then your phone vibrates, it's like, "After this."
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.060]   Right?
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.380]   I was like, "I'm obviously not great at being
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.580]   "a Lord of my life, turn from my sin,
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.040]   "put my faith in Jesus, everything's been different for me
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.880]   "since then."
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.940]   I don't say that to mean like I've been perfect now,
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.300]   but it does mean that now I'm trying to think of my life
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.100]   in terms of being his, it belongs to him.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.500]   Right, so then everything I liked,
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.420]   like I had already been rapping at that point,
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.000]   I wasn't good, I wasn't good, I was terrible.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.540]   My rap name, I think, was The Playboy at that time.
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.740]   Spelled T-H-A,
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.940]   space P-L-A-Y-B-O-I,
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.980]   because it's more gangster than misspelled stuff,
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.740]   it just feels better.
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.540]   But at that point, after I put my faith in Jesus,
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.460]   I'm like, "What does all this mean for him?
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.160]   "How can I give everything to him?"
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.120]   And so I started thinking about,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.420]   already I understood, I had braces and a mini fro,
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.240]   I was like, "I can't rap about killing people,
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.580]   "not a lot of gangsters have this look."
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.640]   And I thought, "How can I just give all of my life
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.820]   "to Jesus, that's what I wanted to do with my music,
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.160]   "that's what I wanted to do with any gifts I have."
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.100]   And you know, I only know about Jesus
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.380]   'cause people told me about him,
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.340]   and I only say all of this to say,
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.620]   I'm excited to be in front of you
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.940]   'cause I wanna tell you more about this Jesus
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.340]   that others have told me about and that I've known
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.960]   and that I've seen in his word.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.120]   So I wanna talk about what Jesus has to say to us today.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.500]   Matthew 6, I wanna read the text first,
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.420]   from Matthew chapter 6.
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.880]   And what I'm gonna be talking to you about
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.380]   is what I call reality show righteousness.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.400]   Reality show righteousness, Matthew chapter 6,
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.480]   I'm gonna start reading at verse one.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.760]   Jesus says this, "Be careful not to practice
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.540]   "your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them.
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.200]   "If you do, you will have no reward
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.400]   "from your Father in heaven."
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.460]   So when you give to the needy,
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.960]   do not announce it with trumpets,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.560]   hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.040]   to be honored by others.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.240]   Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.440]   But when you give to the needy,
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.400]   do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.480]   so that your giving may be in secret.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.840]   Then your Father who sees what is done in secret
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.520]   will reward you.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.940]   And when you pray, don't be like the hypocrites,
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.420]   for they love to pray standing in the synagogues
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.760]   and on the street corners to be seen by others.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.560]   Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.640]   But when you pray, go into your room, close the door,
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.440]   and pray to your Father who is unseen.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.840]   And your Father who sees what is done in secret
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.000]   will reward you.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.880]   And when you pray, don't keep babbling like pagans,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.240]   for they think they'll be heard 'cause of their many words.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.740]   Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.800]   before you ask him.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.360]   That's God's word.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.400]   I wanna talk to you about reality show righteousness.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.360]   And I'll tell you why I'm calling it that.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   In the early 2000s, there was a new development
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.200]   in television where, you know, TV producers
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.520]   who were making TV shows, you know,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.260]   it costs a lot to make a TV show.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.520]   So they're like, man, how can we get new shows
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.440]   without having to make new scripts?
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.320]   And these reality shows began to pop up.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.440]   Now, of course, there are millions of reality shows now.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.420]   Some of y'all watch 'em and you don't want nobody to know,
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.120]   but if I was to look at your DVR,
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   might be some love and hip hop on there.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.860]   God knows.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.780]   But, you know, they would put some people in a room,
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.600]   in a situation, and they would hope for drama, right?
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.800]   'Cause that's what these things usually are.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.340]   And I don't know if you've ever seen a reality show,
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.920]   but there is plenty of drama.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.320]   And there are millions of 'em now.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.120]   And reality shows, I think one of the reasons
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.840]   that people love them is it plays into a lot of things
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.480]   that are already part of our human nature.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.880]   Things that were true before reality shows even existed,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.520]   one, that we do love drama.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.480]   We like to see other people fight for whatever reason.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.680]   But also, we love to be seen.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.080]   We love to have the eyes of other people on us.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.480]   And, you know, I think a lot of us, we like social media.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.440]   You know, we would like to say, oh, it's just,
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.680]   I just feel like I can connect with all of humanity.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.120]   I can just connect with people.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.240]   When in reality, a lot of us just like to have eyes on us.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.080]   We like people.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.520]   We all get to star in our own poorly produced reality shows.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.560]   And I say poorly produced, 'cause I've been seeing people
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.440]   on Instagram stories.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.120]   It's like, bro, you could, there's a lot of filler
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.880]   you could've cut in that story, bro.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:24.080]   Here's part of the danger, is that desire to be seen
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.760]   by other people, to have the eyes of other people on us,
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.080]   that can make it into our spiritual lives, too.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.480]   I don't know if we think that we can be obsessed
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.520]   with the eyes of other people being on us, you know,
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.600]   on our way to work or a class in the morning,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.920]   and while we eating, and while we're at a concert,
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.040]   but somehow when our spiritual life happens,
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.600]   we'll be able to turn that off.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.760]   And here's what happens.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.720]   When we are obsessed with the eyes of other people on us,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.640]   when someone's watching you, doesn't that change
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.240]   how you act when you know somebody's watching?
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.280]   Like, just let you be just like, I don't know,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.480]   just washing dishes.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   You know, washing dishes is, you know,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.640]   a product of the fall, it's not a good thing.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.080]   We shouldn't have to do that, but we do.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.680]   But then let somebody pull their phone out.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.400]   You change your whole, you start trying to wash dishes cool,
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.820]   turn it into a dance for no reason at all,
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.960]   because now somebody's watching you, right?
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.880]   It changes what you're thinking.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.440]   And so we love people watching us,
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.480]   but when we begin to do something
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.200]   for other people watching us,
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.160]   it can poison what we're doing.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.640]   When we're aware of the eyes of other people,
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.400]   it starts to, what other people think starts to compete
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.760]   with the task that you're doing.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.960]   And it's very difficult to be worried
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.560]   about the eyes of other people
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.800]   and worried about the actual goal at hand at the same time.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.320]   So in this text, Jesus is talking to his disciples.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.720]   This is part of Sermon on the Mount,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.440]   Jesus' most famous sermon.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.160]   He's talking to his followers about what it means
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   to actually be a follower of Jesus,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.840]   to be a disciple, to be a learner, a student of Jesus.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.880]   And he talks to them a lot about righteousness
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.080]   and what true righteousness is and what good deeds are.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.560]   And he's challenging a lot of errors in their thinking.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.800]   And he tells them not only what they should do,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.240]   but why and how they should do it.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.560]   And here's why that matters,
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.440]   because Jesus wants more from us
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.320]   than just doing the right stuff.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.640]   Jesus also wants us to do it from the right heart.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.680]   He's not just interested in us going down a checklist.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.520]   And when something doesn't come from the right heart,
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.040]   he's gonna tell us it also doesn't produce the right result.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.360]   That stuff matters.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.840]   And when we do good things for bad reasons,
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.760]   we rob ourselves of good rewards.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.600]   I want you to remember that.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.160]   When we do good things for bad reasons,
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.480]   we rob ourselves of good rewards,
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.560]   and that's at the heart of what Jesus is talking about.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.680]   Here's what I think the main point
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.440]   of this little section is, is this.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.640]   If applause is what you really want,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.360]   that's all you'll really get.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.440]   If applause is what you really want,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.440]   then that's all you'll ever get.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.360]   That's all reality.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.880]   So righteousness can really produce
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.880]   is praise from other people.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.280]   But Jesus is gonna give us a better way,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.760]   and we'll talk through it and see what that looks like.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.840]   So I'm gonna read verse one again.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.160]   This is what Jesus says.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.840]   Be careful not to practice your righteousness
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.040]   in front of others to be seen by them.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.640]   If you do, you'll have no reward
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.200]   from your Father in heaven.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.360]   Jesus knows what we will be tempted towards,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   and so that's why he tells us,
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.760]   beware, be careful, watch out.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.280]   Beware of doing stuff to be seen by others.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.200]   He's saying be careful of acting like something
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.040]   didn't happen unless it happened on Instagram.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.760]   Because sometimes we act like other people seeing us
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.840]   is the only time something actually happened,
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.920]   like it wasn't real.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.720]   Like I never wore that outfit.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.720]   I seen you in it the other day,
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.160]   but I didn't take no pictures in it, so it don't count.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.120]   And so in verse two, he's gonna warn us.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.480]   You know, he warns us against doing good
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.520]   to be honored by others.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.120]   Verse five, to be seen by others.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.920]   Those five words, to be seen by them,
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.600]   he says beware of doing your good deeds
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.720]   to be seen by them.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.800]   Those five words could sum up a lot of what we do
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.640]   with our lives.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.360]   It could sum up a lot of the worst decisions we ever made.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.560]   How many of your bad decisions
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.280]   could be summed up by those words?
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   Why did you even go there?
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.600]   To be seen by others.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.240]   Why do you even hang out with them?
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.400]   They fake.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.640]   To be seen by others, right?
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.800]   Why are you on TikTok doing dances
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.680]   even though you have no discernible dance skills?
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.240]   To be seen by others.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.880]   Being seen by others is not bad in itself,
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.920]   but being seen by others is always bad
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.080]   as a main motivation for what you're doing,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.680]   especially our obedience to Jesus.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.520]   Why is that?
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.880]   Why is it a bad main motivation?
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.960]   One, because you're robbing God of his glory.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.400]   So if worship is ascribing to God the honor
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.440]   and the praise that he deserves for who he is,
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.680]   what happens when we do things
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.080]   based on us being seen by other people
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.840]   is we decide instead of giving honor with our actions,
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.920]   we want to do everything to receive honor.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.440]   And that's a conflict of interest,
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.280]   especially when we remember that the God we're talking about
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.000]   is the God of the universe
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   who holds the universe together by the word of his power.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.520]   We're robbing God of his glory when we make it all about us.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.920]   Scripture calls us to do everything we do
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.920]   for the glory of God,
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.960]   whether we're eating, drinking, all of that,
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.120]   so he can be seen.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.680]   Even that word honor that he uses,
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.120]   that's that word doxa that's also used in scripture
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.400]   to talk about worship and praise of God.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.160]   And we're saying we don't want you to have that God,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.800]   we want to have that ourselves, which is robbery.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.200]   This would almost be like if you were outside with a friend
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.520]   and there was a kid who ran out in the middle of the road
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.160]   and you was on your phone and your friend ran out
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.880]   and dove in front of the car and did one of them little rolls
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.080]   like he was in an action movie and saved this kid's life.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.400]   And then some news cameras showed up.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.040]   And they came up and they was like,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.160]   oh my goodness, what happened here?
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.480]   You was like, I seen it all happen.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.960]   Let me tell you.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.080]   This kid was in danger
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.800]   and I could see some vulnerability in his face
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.240]   as the car was driving up.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.800]   And so I dove out.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.800]   You know, I broke my leg a little bit, I'm limping,
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.000]   but I'm glad I was here.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.920]   Your friend would say, bro, you was on your phone.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.680]   You didn't even notice what happened.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.520]   Why are you trying to steal my credit?
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.600]   Right?
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.760]   This is what we do to God.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.120]   Well, we decide, God,
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.320]   even though you're the one who does the heavy lifting,
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.160]   I want the credit.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.120]   There's lots of things even in our lives
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.480]   that are going well,
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.760]   that I want to remind you that God deserves the glory
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.160]   for that you didn't do that by yourself.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.000]   The job that you have right now,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.880]   the Lord has provided for you.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.240]   I want to remind you, God deserves the glory for that
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.760]   you didn't do that all by yourself.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.240]   If your relationships are going well in your life right now,
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.400]   I want to remind you, God deserves the glory for that
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.040]   you didn't do that all by yourself.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.880]   If you're healthy,
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.200]   if you made it through the pandemic in your right mind,
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.360]   I want to remind you,
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.200]   you don't deserve the glory for all that.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.720]   God deserves that glory.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.280]   And sometimes when things aren't going well,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.040]   it's very clear to us that we're too weak
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.240]   to do everything on our own.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.880]   But when God does give grace for things to go well,
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.320]   we forget he even exists.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.040]   God deserves the glory for that.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.760]   So one of the reasons it's not good
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.120]   to do everything to be seen by others
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.880]   is because we're robbing God of his glory.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.320]   The main reason Jesus gives us in his verse though,
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.600]   is because it'll rob us of the true reward
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.240]   for the good works that God has called us to.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.600]   Let's read verse two again.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.080]   And he talks about two different kinds of good deeds
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   in this little section.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.600]   First thing he's talking about is giving.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.720]   He says, verse two,
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.960]   "When you give to the needy,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.680]   don't announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.600]   in the synagogues and on the streets
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.080]   to be honored by others.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.320]   Truly I tell you, they've received their reward in full."
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.320]   I want you to just imagine this vivid picture
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.320]   that Jesus paints.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.720]   This is, imagine a very religious man,
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.440]   church-going man walking down the street,
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.240]   a very busy street,
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.760]   and he notices a guy sitting on a corner.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.200]   And he thinks this guy might be in need
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.440]   'cause his clothes are tattered.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.520]   It's a very hot day.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.760]   And he looks around and sees that nobody's gonna help him.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.280]   And so this church-going man, he's like,
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.240]   man, I see this guy, maybe he needs some help.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.000]   He feels in his pocket to make sure he has some money
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.520]   to help him out.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.160]   And he breathes a sigh of relief 'cause he does.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.760]   And then he looks around to see if anybody's watching,
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.600]   but that's okay.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.800]   Nobody's really watching, but that's okay.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.880]   He knows just what to do.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.240]   He pulls a trumpet out of his pocket.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.400]   And then he whistles and some friends come around the corner
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.560]   with trumpets as well.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.640]   And then they play their trumpets very loud
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.360]   as they walk up to the man.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.680]   Now, of course, it's a busy street.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.160]   In the middle of the day, people are like,
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.560]   why are dudes wearing jeans big enough
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.160]   to pull trumpets out of their pockets?
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.360]   Don't think too hard about this story.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.080]   Just know they pull 'em out.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.960]   And so now everybody's paying attention.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.560]   So now when he's sure everybody is watching,
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.280]   he leads down toward the man and said,
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.480]   excuse me, brother, I'd like to help you out.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.760]   You seem to be in need.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.600]   Are you in need?
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.200]   The man says yes.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.360]   And then he says, everybody, I want you to see this.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.000]   He pulls 50 cents out of his pocket
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.360]   and he hands it to the man.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.760]   Says, God bless you.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.920]   And then he walks off.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.440]   Isn't that stupid?
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   What's stupid about it is he acts like the good deed
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.240]   finds its value because other people see it.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.560]   This is the picture Jesus painting,
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.900]   who when they give, they play trumpets
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.520]   to make sure all the eyes and the attention
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.700]   are on them in those moments.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.760]   The problem with the hypocrite he's talking about here
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.040]   is that we can often begin to care more
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.420]   about looking godly than actually being godly.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.120]   What's most important to us is that we look
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.880]   like righteous people, not that we actually
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.520]   are righteous people, which is a hilarious picture
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.360]   of the hypocrite.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.280]   I just want you to know that God is not impressed
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.520]   with your little displays of fake righteousness.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.360]   Maybe you can impress other people,
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.080]   but God is not impressed by them.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.300]   And when we go after those little displays
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.120]   of fake righteousness, it robs us of that reward.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.720]   This is what Jesus says the result is.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.480]   I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.320]   In other words, whatever honor they got
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.120]   for that so-called good deed, I hope they enjoyed it
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.960]   'cause that's all they're gonna get for it.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.400]   I think sometimes we think, oh no,
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.880]   if people see me do good things,
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.720]   I can add that to the reward I receive from God
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.160]   for my good deeds.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.240]   But what Jesus says is no, you're actually making a trade.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.280]   You're actually saying no thanks to the rewards
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.160]   I could get from God, I would rather have
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.920]   earthly praise instead.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.280]   Now you may say, Tripp, I know we're not wearing
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.200]   skinny jeans no more, but my jeans ain't big enough
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.500]   to put a trumpet in there.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.440]   Sorry if you have on skinny jeans.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.640]   [audience laughs]
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.640]   It's all right, make your own decisions.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.480]   [audience laughs]
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.320]   But we still like to do things where we draw attention
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.160]   to ourselves.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.180]   I know you've seen people like helping people
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.000]   like hey, I'm here with, what's your name?
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.960]   I'm here with Harold, you know what I'm saying?
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.600]   It's like, bro, if he needs help, just help him.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.160]   We love to draw attention to ourselves.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.440]   Just over here sweeping for Jesus.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.680]   Y'all see me sweeping?
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.880]   We love to serve in ways where we can draw attention
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.080]   to ourselves.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.120]   Y'all remember Drake's God's plan video
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.040]   where he was like going around giving people money?
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.960]   I hate that kind of stuff.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.180]   No offense to Drake.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.480]   What God is calling us to,
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.040]   it's not drawing attention to ourselves.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.760]   You know, even sometimes we'll be like, man,
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.120]   let me tell you, I ran into this dude.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.040]   Man, he was neat.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.640]   Let me tell you what he said.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.680]   He said, I need something.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.080]   And I was like, bro, I got you, right?
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.880]   We love to retell stories.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.060]   What God is saying is that when we are so obsessed
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.080]   with that, it takes away.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.400]   And he gives us a better way.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.960]   This is what he says, verse three.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.040]   But when you give to the needy, don't let your left hand
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.920]   know what your right hand is doing
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.600]   so that your giving may be in secret.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.620]   Then your father who sees what is done in secret
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.580]   will reward you.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.000]   Again, he exaggerates a little bit,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.400]   but he's saying, I want you to give in such a way,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.040]   in such a secret manner, that one of your hands
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.240]   wouldn't even know that the other one
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.940]   was handing something to somebody.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.160]   Right, because he's saying that other people seeing you
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.260]   is not the main thing.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.280]   And of course, we can push this too far.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.960]   But I want you to know, if there was a friend of yours
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.560]   in need and you needed to buy them groceries
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.200]   and you did it and not a single soul knew about it,
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.120]   would you be content with that?
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.460]   If you volunteered half of your time
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.100]   to serve other people in need and nobody else knew about it,
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.500]   would you be content with that?
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.220]   The things that you do in your life right now,
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.700]   ways that you serve, or ways you're considering serving,
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.460]   like some stuff you heard this weekend.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.060]   Would you be cool if nobody knew about it?
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:01.900]   Jesus is saying we should serve in secret.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.340]   Now, this is not to say no one can ever see you
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.540]   serve anywhere, right?
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.880]   Earlier in chapter five in the same sermon,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.280]   Jesus says, "Let our light shine before men
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.640]   "so they may see your good deeds
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.680]   "and glorify our Father in heaven."
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.140]   Right, he's saying we want people to see our light.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.960]   But these people are trying to be seen
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.880]   in order that they can honor themselves.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.520]   Jesus is saying, allow yourself to be seen
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.400]   in order to bring glory to God.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.940]   So there's a big difference in being faithful to Jesus
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.160]   in public or trying to draw a crowd
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   so people can see you do something good.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.600]   He's calling us to be faithful to Jesus
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.720]   wherever we are, whatever time.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   Y'all still with me?
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.560]   Okay.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.680]   So this is what he says.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.260]   Your father who sees what is done in secret
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.760]   will reward you.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.560]   God sees what is done in secret and that should be enough.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.000]   That's the main thing he's getting at.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.080]   No, no, you won't get that praise, but God sees.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.800]   Sometimes we feel like I've been laboring,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.760]   nobody appreciates me, nobody sees.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.840]   What scripture reminds us about is that God sees.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.200]   The things that you do in your life,
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.600]   you're like, no one understands how hard this is for me.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.080]   No one understands how difficult.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.180]   I want you to know God sees.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.200]   You know, scripture talks about not being weary
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.140]   in a well-doing or that your labor is not in vain.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.260]   God sees.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.480]   Now on the other side, there can be something scary
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   about the fact that God sees.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.240]   But he says, God sees what is done in secret.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.560]   What does your life look like in secret?
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.280]   That would be one of my questions.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.960]   Usually when we hear secret, we think of scandalous things.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.600]   Wouldn't it be amazing if what happens in your life
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.880]   in secret is not scandalous, but it's praiseworthy?
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.600]   There are things about our secret lives
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.560]   that show us more about who we are than our public lives.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.200]   No one sees us, the only motivation we have to do it
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.860]   is the thing itself.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:00.200]   Wouldn't it be amazing if what you do in secret
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.720]   brought praise to God instead of shame on him?
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.240]   This is what he's calling us to.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.920]   So he's gonna talk about prayer now.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.040]   Verse five, this is what Jesus says as he continues.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.040]   He says, "And when you pray, don't be like the hypocrites,
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.780]   "for they love standing in the synagogues
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.200]   "and on the street corners to be seen by others.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.800]   "Truly I tell you, they've received their reward in full.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.320]   "But when you pray, go into your room, close the door,
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.260]   "and pray to your Father who's unseen.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.200]   "Then your Father who sees what is done in secret
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.400]   "will reward you."
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.760]   Again, he brings up these hypocrites.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.840]   What are they doing this time?
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.080]   They're praying all out and in the way,
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.880]   making sure people can see them pray.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.040]   He mentions again being in the synagogues
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:36.880]   and in the streets.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.960]   What do synagogues and streets have in common?
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.680]   Synagogue is a public place of worship.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.040]   Streets is a public place where everyone is.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.800]   It's again a public place.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   And here's something that might surprise you.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.320]   Hypocrites love to pray.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.560]   Don't be like the hypocrites,
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.400]   for they love to pray standing in the synagogues.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.360]   Here's a reminder, you can love prayer
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.040]   and still not love God.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.640]   Some of us pray because we love ourselves so much
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.620]   and we want other people to love us as much as we do.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.320]   Like look how holy this prayer is.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:13.380]   It says something about the human heart
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.760]   that we can be so self-centered
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.160]   that we can even make service about ourselves.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.080]   We can even make praying to God,
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.540]   which is supposed to be an acknowledgement
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.020]   that we need him, that we're weak, we need him.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.700]   We can turn that into something about ourselves as well.
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.900]   And you can probably think of somebody in your mind
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.040]   who's like this, who does this all the time,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.020]   who prays in these big words.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.140]   Such a churchy person who's real showy
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.500]   in everything that they pray and that they do.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.380]   Well, I want you to, if you're thinking about that person
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.220]   and that person's in your mind,
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.060]   I want you to forget about them
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.620]   because Jesus is talking to you.
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.140]   All of us can be tempted toward this kind of hypocrisy.
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.500]   You know, usually when we think hypocrite,
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.820]   we think somebody who says something
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.540]   and then they live a completely different life.
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.180]   That is a very real kind of hypocrite.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.740]   Another kind of hypocrite is somebody
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.280]   who does do the right things, but for all the wrong reasons.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.020]   That's what Jesus is getting at here.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.060]   There's still a rat within their souls.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.500]   You know, some of us, when we pray,
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.940]   maybe we wouldn't say God wants to hear us
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.980]   say a bunch of words,
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.060]   but then we just talk way different when we pray.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.100]   I must be like, man, LeBron, old, he not even good,
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.380]   oh, we about to pray.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.400]   Heavenly Father, we beseech thee.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.020]   Father, we are bewildered by your omnipotence.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.860]   Bro, spell bewildered.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:30.940]   You don't know what that means.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.940]   [audience laughing]
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.820]   Who told you you have to pray like that?
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:42.540]   Sometimes we are trying to impress other people
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.440]   with words we looked up on the way to the prayer meet.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.380]   That's not what God has called us to, all right?
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.500]   So some of us talk a good talk
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.080]   and we show up to things and we serve,
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.940]   but there's still hypocrisy in our hearts
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.700]   because we're doing it to be seen.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.980]   Jesus has shown us the difference
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.580]   between a hypocrite and a disciple.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.180]   Hypocrites just want to be seen,
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.940]   disciples just want to be used.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.220]   Hypocrites want status, disciples just want to serve.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.020]   Hypocrites want to put on a show,
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.900]   disciples want the Lord's work to get done.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.900]   Hypocrites get satisfaction from the praise of other people,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.360]   disciples find their satisfaction in pleasing Jesus.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.160]   We want to ask ourselves,
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.120]   do I have the posture of a hypocrite or a disciple?
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.960]   And it's very hard because so much of our lives
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.080]   have become about being seen by other people.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.680]   And all of us can be tempted toward hypocrisy.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.960]   So this is not to say someone with genuine faith in Jesus
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.980]   can't act in a hypocritical manner sometimes.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.400]   So how do we fight against having,
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.000]   letting this hypocrisy sneak up on us?
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.320]   One way is to be transparent about who you really are,
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.860]   tell on yourself often, confess your sins.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:28:00.720]   It's very hard to both be overly concerned
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.160]   about fake righteousness while also being honest
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.440]   about who you really are.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.840]   Be transparent about the ways
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.000]   you don't have it all together.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.260]   If you catch a hint of people acting like
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.920]   you're the perfect Christian and follower of God
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.080]   and you make no mistakes,
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.960]   you should correct them right then on the spot.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.780]   'Cause here's what happens,
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.960]   once people have that view of you
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.760]   and you've presented yourself as this person
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.960]   who has it all together,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.640]   then you spend the rest of your time
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.840]   trying to maintain that.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.900]   And anything that offers any evidence
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.120]   to the contrary of you being this perfect Christian
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.620]   that you've shown people that you wanna be seen as,
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.200]   then you begin to wanna hide that stuff.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.600]   I wanna encourage you, do not do that.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.400]   Live honestly and openly.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.400]   Here's one thing I've seen,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.160]   every time I confess my sin to another Christian,
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.760]   even if I gotta talk myself into it,
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.320]   like, man, I want him to know
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.880]   that I'm such a bum like this,
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.680]   but I'm gonna confess my sin, you can do it,
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.120]   and I confess my sin, and people be like,
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.760]   bro, I've been struggling with the same thing.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.600]   Every time I confess my sin to another Christian,
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.720]   they confess their sin back to me.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.360]   Here's what happens,
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.840]   all of us think we the only ones who got sin,
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.960]   but when we're open and transparent,
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.840]   what it does is it helps us to walk together,
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.920]   right, to help each other to grow.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.000]   I think this transparency can keep us
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   from this self-righteous hypocrisy.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.040]   Does that make sense?
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.480]   - Yeah.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:24.840]   - If applause is all we're chasing,
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.000]   that's all we'll ever get.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.120]   This is what Jesus tells us in verse six,
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.800]   there's a better way than chasing applause.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.720]   Verse six, when you pray, go into your room,
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.560]   close the door, pray to your father who's unseen,
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.040]   then your father who sees what is done in secret
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.040]   will reward you.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.720]   It's just like the hiding it from your hands.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.240]   He's saying when you pray, go into your closet and pray.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.840]   Some of us pray, but we never pray when we're alone.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   We only pray with other people.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.920]   Do not treat a church, a small group, anything else
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.000]   as a platform to perform for others with prayers.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.720]   I wanna encourage you to make a habit of praying in private.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.880]   It can be hard to pray.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.040]   I don't think I've ever met a Christian
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.320]   who if I said, hey, do you think you pray enough?
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.640]   They'd be like, yes.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.080]   That's not typically how we feel.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.880]   Most of us feel like we do not pray enough.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.920]   I wanna encourage you,
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.040]   it can be hard to carve out time to pray a lot.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.880]   I wanna encourage you to just pray in small chunks.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.360]   One of the reasons is like this,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.880]   we think we gotta say a lot of words.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.400]   We're like, I wanted to pray this morning,
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.840]   but I didn't have an hour to carve out.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.100]   It's like, no, nobody's praying for an hour.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.040]   If they said they did, they lied.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.240]   And they need to pray about that.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.360]   Nah, I mean, some people somewhere,
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:43.360]   but most of us do not have the attention span
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.440]   to pray for an hour.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.040]   And sometimes we think if we pray briefly,
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.920]   like it's not a real prayer.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.960]   I wanna encourage you, just always be praying,
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.680]   like on the way to work.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.360]   Just pray, on the way to school, just pray.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.840]   When you get home, just say,
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.280]   Lord, please give me grace today.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.160]   I know I'm gonna run into this person
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.360]   and I be wanting to punch them.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.680]   God, give me grace to not punch in Jesus' name, amen, right?
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.840]   Just be praying often.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.920]   Ask God for grace, ask God for help.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.400]   When you see somebody struggling,
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.200]   instead of texting somebody and talking about 'em,
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.380]   ask God to help them.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.520]   Always be praying.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.360]   Pray when nobody knows you're praying.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.480]   Pray when you can't say you had this amazing quiet time
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.600]   and sound like a deep Christian.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.540]   Just be in communication with your heavenly father.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.800]   Pray all the time.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.260]   Scripture talks about praying without ceasing.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.080]   I want you to make it a habit.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.080]   What Jesus is getting at is,
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.680]   when you only wanna pray for people to think you're deep,
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.560]   I hope you like that reward of people thinking
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.360]   you're a deep, very spiritual person
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.880]   'cause that's all the reward you'll get.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.220]   I mean, it's kinda like The Bachelorette,
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.680]   which is a reality show, of course,
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.000]   and I'm sure none of you have ever seen,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   where like 30 dudes show up trying to marry the same woman
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.520]   and, you know, they all say they're there for a wife
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.960]   and, you know, no shade,
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.880]   but I can think of better ways to meet one.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.560]   And a lot of dudes, you know,
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.800]   one person maybe marries the girl,
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.280]   but 29 of them dudes leave home with the same amount of wife
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.680]   that they had when they got there, which is none.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.660]   Now, maybe they got more followers,
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.260]   and look, if that's what you wanted, then good.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.800]   I hope you're happy with the reward that you got.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.440]   This is what Jesus is getting at.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.040]   When we pursue things in ways
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.740]   that are more about the eyes on us
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.680]   than actually the best way to do it,
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.520]   then we should, you know,
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.800]   just know you need to be content with the reward
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.640]   that you're gonna get.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.400]   It robs us of what we can really get.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.520]   And he talks about rewards.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.960]   What are those rewards that we would get from God?
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.000]   Well, Scripture says that,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.800]   though our only motivation to obey God
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.580]   shouldn't be what he'll give us in return,
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.680]   that he does promise to give us rewards,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.520]   not because he owes them to us, just 'cause he's gracious.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.220]   God has invited us into the work
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.720]   that he don't even need us to do,
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.240]   and then he rewards us for the work
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.680]   that he strengthened us to do in the first place.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.360]   This is the kind of gracious God
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.140]   that we find in Scripture.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.920]   What exactly are those rewards, though?
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.560]   Scripture's not super clear,
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.240]   other than we know there are good rewards that we get.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.080]   And so you may say,
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.560]   "How could I be motivated by God's rewards
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.720]   "instead of to praise the people
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.880]   "if I don't even know what they are?"
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.740]   Give you an example.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.320]   I have kids.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.200]   I have a son.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   His name is Q.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.960]   And when I first started taking him to the barbershop,
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.480]   you know, kids can't sit still for very long.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.960]   And so I was like, "Hey, if you're good,
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.200]   "if you sit still, I will give you a special treat."
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.840]   His eyes lit up.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.480]   He was excited.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.940]   And he was very still.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.840]   I could've convinced him to do anything for me
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.680]   in that moment.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.060]   When he heard those words, "special treat,"
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.960]   I should've had him do my taxes.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.280]   But I wasn't thinking ahead,
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.320]   so I just said, "Sit still,
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.160]   "and I'll give you a special treat."
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   You know what he didn't do?
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.880]   He didn't say, "But hold on, hold on, hold on,
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.320]   "now, what kind of special treat are we talking about?
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.200]   "We talking about Starbursts, Skittles, Goldfish,
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.920]   "and if you got Goldfish, they gotta be flavor-blasted.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.420]   "No one likes the regular ones.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.300]   "Those taste like nothing."
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.120]   No, he didn't do that.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.280]   He said, "I know my dad.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.520]   "My dad always comes through with the good special treats.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.720]   "He knew my track record."
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.040]   What I'm saying to you is,
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.800]   has the God of heaven not shown his track record?
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.320]   Has he not shown that he's a promise-keeping God?
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.640]   Has he not shown that he has good rewards for us?
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.920]   The God who split the Red Sea,
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.920]   the God who put on human flesh,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.920]   the God who raised Jesus from the dead.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.400]   Has he not shown enough for us to trust him and say,
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.600]   "I don't know exactly what those rewards will be,
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.360]   "but I know that you are a good God
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.240]   "who keeps his promises and gives rewards
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.000]   "better than I could even imagine."
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.640]   I need you to understand, like, some social media likes,
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.620]   or like, somebody thinking you deep or cool or something,
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.660]   that sounds so dumb compared to the rewards
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.400]   that come from the God who owns a cattle on 1,000 hills,
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.860]   from the God who says,
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.680]   the earth is mine and everything that's in it,
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.080]   everything that's in it.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.380]   Even if we don't know exactly what those rewards look like,
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.100]   we do know what that God is like,
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.200]   and that's the kind of God
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.300]   that I would like to receive rewards from,
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.040]   who's worthy of being faithful to,
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.520]   and we should trust him to give us good things.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.480]   Verse seven, we're wrapping up.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.740]   He says, "When you pray, don't keep babbling like the pagans.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.220]   "They think they'll be heard 'cause of their many words."
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.820]   At the time, you know, these pagan deities,
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.440]   they're like, "No, we have to say a lot of words
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.000]   "to grab their attention.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.220]   "If we don't keep saying words,
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.860]   "we won't be able to get the attention of these false gods."
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.540]   He's saying, "Don't be like them,
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.120]   "because we have a God who we don't get his attention
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.780]   "by babbling a lot of words.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.820]   "The attention of God comes because he loves us
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.360]   "and he wants to hear from us."
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.500]   You don't have to pray and sound deep
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.620]   and say a bunch of words.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.780]   That's not why God pays attention to us.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.900]   He actually says, "Your father knows what you need
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.180]   "before you ask him."
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.940]   So when we pray to God, this is not an exercise
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.100]   in informing God and educating God
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.460]   on what's happening in our lives.
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.140]   God already knows.
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.540]   You might say, "But why would I pray?
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.340]   "Why would I bring it to God if God already knows?"
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.060]   We're not educating God, but casting our cares on God.
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.260]   We're saying, "God, I give this to you."
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.420]   And for whatever reason,
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.300]   even though God already knows what's going on in your life,
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.420]   he wants you to bring it to him and he finds pleasure
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:30.900]   in blessing you in response to you asking him to do that.
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.580]   'Cause it shows him to be the gracious, loving,
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.580]   good father that he is.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.860]   It should not hinder our prayers that he already knows.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.340]   It should draw us to him.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.540]   We're not talking about a God who will explain it
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.740]   and he's like, "I don't really understand
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.600]   "exactly what that is.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.220]   "Can you give me a better picture?"
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.480]   God is not like a judge in a courtroom
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.220]   where lawyers have to lay out the case
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.020]   so God would have no idea what actually happened.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.140]   You have to show him evidence
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.460]   'cause otherwise he wouldn't know what's going on.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.780]   We're talking about the God who sees everything all the time
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.020]   and knows about your needs before you even do.
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.100]   And that same God is like, "Hand 'em over to me.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:04.940]   "I got you."
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.940]   But he's saying it doesn't have to be public.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.340]   If applause is all you really want,
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.100]   that's all you'll ever get.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.840]   One of the reasons this can be hard for us
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.980]   is because we really do struggle
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.260]   with approval from other people.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.140]   Some of us struggle with approval from other people
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.220]   for different reasons.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.900]   Stuff, just our own insecurities,
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.180]   stuff that happened in childhood.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.460]   Some of us had relationships, formative relationships
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.500]   when we were young that weren't where they should be.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.540]   So the approval that we miss from our dad
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.620]   or from our mom or our siblings or friends,
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.580]   whatever it is, we're always running around
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.900]   trying to find it in other places.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.740]   And there can be an insecurity that comes from that
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.500]   that we have to work through and get over.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.600]   Well, what Jesus has shown us here
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.620]   is there can also be a spiritual insecurity
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.700]   where we think there's something we have to prove
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.820]   about our righteousness in order for righteousness
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.340]   to be seen in us.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.060]   But I want to tell you that there is an approval
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.160]   that comes from God that is given to us in Jesus,
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.620]   that we do not have to earn,
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.040]   that other people don't have to give us.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.180]   You do not need other people to see you
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.620]   and point out and thumbs up your righteousness
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.900]   if the God of the universe
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.420]   has declared you righteous in Jesus.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.720]   The only righteousness that really matters
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.960]   for your standing spiritually is the righteousness
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.800]   that is given you freely from Jesus.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.000]   And you can rest in that.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.900]   You may say, "Tripp, how can I rest
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.840]   "in being seen as righteous when we are all sinners?"
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.960]   I have good news for you.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.920]   There's a Savior named Jesus
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.080]   who lived the absolutely perfect life
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.460]   and then laid his life down.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.760]   He said, "You're a sinner.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.140]   "I'll take your punishment,
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.620]   "and you can be treated as if you lived my perfect life.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.420]   "Here's my perfect righteousness."
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.960]   You couldn't live the perfect righteous life on your own.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.160]   Jesus is saying, "Here, I'll give you mine."
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.640]   It's like trying to pay with your credit card
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.940]   and it gets declined, and Jesus shows up and he's like,
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.000]   "I'll take your poverty.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.280]   "Here, take my card.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.880]   "Act like you have my account."
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.120]   Your righteousness account can be full
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.760]   through faith in Jesus.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.880]   So what I'm saying is you don't have to run around
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.740]   trying to find approval from other people
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.280]   if you already have it in Jesus.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.660]   And that is free.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:19.660]   You know, some of us are wrestling with insecurities
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.980]   and anxieties for various reasons,
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.840]   and there's all kind of stuff around us,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.920]   but one of the things that is helpful for me
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.160]   in those moments is to remember,
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.920]   I spend too much time thinking about me.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:39.360]   I spend too much time focusing on my own weaknesses
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.760]   and other people seeing those weaknesses.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.680]   What Jesus is saying, look, even as you serve,
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.940]   I want you to remember there's a God
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.340]   that's much bigger than you,
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:55.300]   much bigger than this particular way you're serving,
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.360]   and you want that God to be so big
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.100]   that he looms large over every decision you make,
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.520]   every time you serve, every conversation you have.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.220]   That's what Jesus has called us to.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.380]   So maybe you're saying, "Look, if God sees
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.080]   "what's done in secret, I'm in trouble,
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.220]   "but I want you to know,
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.020]   "even if you haven't been very generous,
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.100]   "Jesus was, became poor so that we can be rich."
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.100]   I haven't prayed sincerely enough.
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.720]   Jesus did, he prayed all night 'til he sweat blood.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.980]   Maybe you're angry, I want you to know
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.980]   Jesus was patient on our behalf.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.180]   I could go on and on and on.
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:29.620]   There's a Savior, we have perfect approval through him.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:34.040]   So my encouragement to you is serve out of love
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.340]   to bring honor to God, not to yourself, amen?
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.280]   Amen, let's pray.
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.540]   Father, we thank you so much for Jesus.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.100]   We thank you, Father, that we don't have
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.780]   to manufacture a righteousness.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.800]   Father, we thank you that we don't have
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.560]   to prove our righteousness to anyone.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.860]   We thank you for righteousness in Jesus.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.620]   Father, I pray for my friends here
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:58.580]   who are still getting to know who Jesus is, Father,
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.820]   who is maybe skeptical.
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.780]   God, I pray you would show them the beauty of a Savior
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.080]   who says, "Come as you are, and I'll clean you up."
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.980]   Father, I pray they would see the beauty of a Savior
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.020]   who doesn't say, "Hey, just keep running
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.740]   "on this treadmill forever," but instead,
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.560]   Jesus says, "I'll hand you the righteousness
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.500]   "and run in light of what I've given you."
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.100]   Father, we pray you would free us from people-pleasing.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.340]   We pray you would free us from just living every moment
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.180]   for other people's sin, how good we are,
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.660]   wanting to prove ourselves to others.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.660]   Help us to live in the freedom.
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.580]   Help us to swim in that freedom
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:33.420]   that you've given us in your Son, Jesus.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.780]   We ask all of this in Jesus' name, amen.
