[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.960]   All right, all right.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.400]   It's good to be with you guys.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.720]   Nothing like starting a little series with some Beyonce.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.600]   This is Cupid.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.220]   And the reason we're calling it Cupid,
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.400]   because we're covering dating myths.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.080]   And so Cupid is a Roman mythology.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.560]   You know, Cupid was Venus' son.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.520]   And anyone he would shoot with magical arrows
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.840]   would fall in love with the first person they see.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.720]   So as I thought about kind of where we're going to go tonight,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.200]   this weekend I renewed my CHL.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.080]   If you don't know what that means, it's--
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.920]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.280]   Wow.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.360]   OK, man.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.680]   Laura, make note, CHL illustrations.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.400]   More of those.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.520]   OK.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.640]   I'm scared all of a sudden.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.560]   So that stands for-- so those in the dark.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.080]   Concealed handgun license.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.240]   Hopefully that's what you guys were cheering about,
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.760]   not some other CHL.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.320]   So I went and renewed--
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.960]   that's something my community group did about a year ago.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.240]   Or I guess it was more than a year ago.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.520]   Anyways, it just expired.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.100]   And so we had to go back and renew it.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.000]   And so we met up.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.360]   And I was reminded of this story.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.920]   We were kind of talking back the first time that we did it.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.600]   And so if you don't know, we're shooting at a target.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.800]   The target looks like this.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.720]   You have to go and do a field trial.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.320]   And so this was mine.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.400]   And so kind of that's not impressive.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.800]   Everybody's looked like that.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.360]   And you're not shooting that far off.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.880]   You're kind of this close.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.560]   And they're like, OK, fire five rounds.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.800]   Like boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.560]   One, two, three.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.060]   Yeah.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.120]   Anyways, and then fire two more.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.620]   Boom.
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.720]   And then you go and load it up again
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.000]   and then fire some more rounds.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.280]   And kind of at the end, you fired 50 rounds.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.320]   And you get graded.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.480]   They have to pass.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.600]   And everybody's kind of target looked like this.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.400]   But there was this girl there that
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.720]   was helping the coach, the teacher of the class,
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.800]   the instructor.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.880]   And she was a professional shooter.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.960]   And they had told us that.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.720]   And we had kind of heard about her all day long.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.920]   People were telling stories about how great she was.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.700]   And so kind of towards the end of that time, I was like, man,
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.340]   all of us were like, hey, we want to see her go.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.420]   Can she go?
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.780]   And the guy, the instructor, was like, yeah, sure.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.700]   Hey, you up for it?
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.680]   And she's like, yeah.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.600]   And so they put the target-- they're
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.740]   on these electronic things.
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.140]   And they put the target way back.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.700]   And so she's like this way, like this far, even farther back
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.620]   than this from the target.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.220]   And so she kind of takes aim.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.340]   And they're like, you ready?
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.420]   And she's like, yeah.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.620]   And she starts shooting at it.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.200]   Boom, boom.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.340]   And while she's shooting, she's walking like this.
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.220]   Boom, boom.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.460]   And they kind of sidestep and boom, boom, boom.
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.340]   And just rapid firing these rounds
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.660]   and walking towards the target.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.940]   And I'm watching.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.180]   And I'm looking at the target.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.300]   And I'm thinking, oh, no.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.780]   She's missing every time.
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.060]   And so I'm in my mind.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.820]   I'm thinking what I'm going to say.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.140]   I'm like, well, hey, that's really hard.
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.860]   You were moving.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.360]   You know?
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.980]   And it's harder than it looks, isn't it, sweetie?
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.500]   You know, you're thinking kind of these things.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.340]   And I'm like, what am I going to say?
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.760]   Like, we're all sitting there like, this is embarrassing.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.840]   And so they kind of--
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.460]   you could see the target plain as day.
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.040]   There's no holes in it, right?
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.380]   And we're like, oh, no.
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.640]   And so they bring the target.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.680]   She's like, OK, bring the target back.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.840]   I'm like, you don't have to do that.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.840]   I can see there's no holes in it, you know?
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.800]   And they bring it back.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.720]   And I don't know if you can see from where you're at,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.000]   but there's a little target up here.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.960]   You know?
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.680]   There's a little one up here.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.320]   I didn't know.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.360]   That's just how they score it.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.260]   And evidently, evidently, she was shooting at that one.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.500]   Yeah, I had no idea.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.100]   We're like, whoa.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.580]   Wow.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.860]   So they brought it up there.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.060]   Ellie, you're good.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.580]   Look at you.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.140]   You've done that before, huh, sweetie?
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.900]   I'm just teasing.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.500]   I'm just kidding.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.980]   Yeah, and so here was the problem.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.260]   What was the problem, right?
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.100]   We were watching this.
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.880]   We were looking at the wrong target.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.720]   We were looking at the wrong target.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.920]   And as I thought about you guys, you're considering someone--
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.760]   you're in this season of life where
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   you're starting to think about someone you might
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.720]   spend the rest of your life with.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.640]   And you guys know my heart's burning for you.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.760]   I love young adults.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.840]   I trusted Christ as a young adult.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.880]   Man, I just made so many mistakes in my life,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.860]   bad decisions, not mistakes, but bad decisions.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.220]   And the cry of my heart, I think,
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.020]   is to spare you as much as I can.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.540]   And I think all the time, I'm like,
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.420]   what would I have listened to?
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.660]   What would I have listened to?
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.300]   Like, what would have got my attention?
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.940]   Because I think as you guys are looking for someone
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.100]   or considering someone that you might spend the rest
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.180]   of your life with, I think so many of us
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.820]   are looking at the wrong target.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.460]   We got the wrong target in mind.
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.000]   And the reason that's so important
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.760]   is because this is something that
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.700]   is going to affect the destiny, the destination,
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.360]   of the rest of your life.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.000]   And you know, everyone here knows,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.440]   people who've done it well and people who haven't done it
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.000]   so well.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.520]   And I just think, I think, if we can just reset,
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.440]   if I can get you to believe me, not so much me,
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.800]   but the wisest man ever lived, not so much the wisest man ever
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.260]   lived, but the one who created all things,
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.360]   if I can get you to trust it, I think
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.760]   that we can redirect our sights to the right target.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.840]   And everyone can leave here tonight
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.280]   with just a little bit better of a trajectory
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.960]   as we consider what might be next.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.320]   And so we're covering myths every week.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.320]   And I think this first myth is just
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.480]   the idea of love at first sight, the dating
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.720]   myth of love at first sight.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.960]   And you're like, oh, no, you haven't
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.840]   heard my parents' story, or my cousin's story,
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.040]   or my Uncle Bob's story.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.280]   Just hear me out.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.520]   But I want to show you tonight just this idea of what happens.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.280]   Because love at first sight, what is that?
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.840]   It's trusting in a moment our feelings
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.640]   and following our hormones instead of logic.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.720]   And moreover, logic, actually God's word,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.400]   what God says, the one who created all things, who's
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.240]   crazy about you, who wants what's best for you,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.800]   what he says about this.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   And so tonight, my hope is I'm going
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.920]   to take a real logical approach at this.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.280]   If you're here and you're married, I'm stoked you're here.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.120]   I need your help.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.620]   Because you're going to be the one with the perspective that
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.720]   can say, hey, he's right.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.760]   No, trust me.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.320]   We just know there's some things.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.880]   Like I remember there's just some things I would not
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.280]   listen to as a single person.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.480]   I'm like, yeah, that's cute.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.520]   Yeah, but you're married.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.280]   You don't get it.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.600]   And so I need your help.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.040]   If you're here and you're thinking, hey, you know what?
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.820]   I might be called to a life of singleness.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.220]   If that's you, great, I'm glad you're here.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.220]   Listen and learn from the scriptures
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.860]   so that you can minister to those around you.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.660]   But if you're here and you're single,
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.220]   over the next four weeks, we're going
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.780]   to open the word of the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.580]   And we're going to read about what some really wise people
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.540]   have written.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.960]   And all I'm going to ask of you is that you would trust it.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.740]   And if you will, it will help you the remainder of your days.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.780]   And not only that, but I think you'll love God more.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.060]   And have a greater understanding of how God loves you.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.980]   So right now, so here's the problem as I see it.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.940]   The way that this deal, dating, originally started--
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.180]   so a guy would pursue a woman for a reason.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.980]   So I want to show you how we got so far off.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.620]   Because right now, we are so far off.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.220]   And you see the lens of dating through the world
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.380]   that you were born in, which is very different today
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.580]   than it was even a century ago.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.700]   Very, very different, even two decades ago.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.180]   And so this is how we got here.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.900]   Originally, a man would pursue a woman for one reason.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.780]   Do you know what that reason was?
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.540]   Not love, but a family.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.220]   He would pursue a woman so that it was a means to a family,
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.180]   to pursue a relationship with her.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.620]   They would get married, and they would have a family.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.340]   This is God's first commandment of man.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.220]   It's Genesis 1, "Be fruitful and multiply.
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.180]   Fill the earth."
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.860]   This is the first thing God asked man to do.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.180]   And so man would pursue a woman for the sake of a family.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.900]   And so in 1896, the word dating is introduced.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.700]   And dating is actually, in 1896,
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.220]   introduced as a euphemism for prostitution.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.780]   Okay, it literally means exchanging things
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.180]   or money for sex.
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.460]   And so if you went on a date with a girl,
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.200]   that meant that you sought out a prostitute.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.620]   That's where the word comes from.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.220]   In the first century, I'm sorry,
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.800]   in the turn of the 20th century,
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.660]   so in the beginning of the 1900s,
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.180]   if a girl was caught alone with a guy,
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.380]   through that event, she would earn a reputation.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.700]   Okay, people would think that she was either loose
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.020]   or working.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.840]   True story.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.660]   Okay, so then we go into the 1900s,
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.920]   and now you have the introduction of media,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.140]   which is a major influence now.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.300]   And so over one million ladies
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.500]   subscribe to Ladies Home Journal.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.860]   And that begins to influence the way women dress,
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.300]   the way they saw themselves, and the definition of beauty.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.580]   And then in the 1930s, the date outside the home was born
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.660]   with the invention of the automobile.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.480]   Here's what this means.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.660]   Prior to the 1930s, a man, if you wanted to pursue a woman,
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.780]   you would start with her father,
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.740]   and you would ask if you could come into the home,
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.300]   and then you would date her in the living room.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.980]   That's where the dates happened, prior to the 1930s.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.380]   Now, with the invention of the automobile,
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.980]   this idea of this euphemism of prostitution,
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.220]   it really takes off, because what happens
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.740]   is wealthy guys have cars,
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.300]   and so wealthy guys can go on dates.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.500]   And so there's this understanding,
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   the more money you make, the nicer you dress,
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.220]   and the nicer car that you have,
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.500]   the more beautiful girl that you can get,
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.980]   okay, an idea that has been magnified today.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.040]   And there was an understanding that the greater the date,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.340]   you could expect some sexual favor in return.
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.900]   True story.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.400]   This is the history of dating.
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:32.060]   And then in the 1940s, this was like full blown out.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.860]   There was just an understanding of an exchange,
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.540]   if you went on a date, basically what I just said.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.540]   In the 1960s, the dating lifestyle of society
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.900]   led way, the greatest social decay of morality
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.120]   in the history of singleness in the Western world.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.220]   Anybody know what it was?
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.460]   The sexual revolution.
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.940]   You and I still stand under the consequences
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.900]   of the sexual revolution.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.640]   This radically altered the sexual landscape of our nation.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.180]   And now sex is seen as an experience.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.760]   And so what happened now is people began
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.940]   to date for an experience.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.260]   This should sound really familiar to you.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.820]   'Cause people don't date for a family anymore,
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.500]   they date for an experience.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.720]   Manic highs, manic lows, an adrenaline rush,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.880]   or some sexual pleasure.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.620]   In the 1970s, Playboy is placed out in plain sight,
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.020]   in convenience stores, abortion is legalized,
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.940]   and now this is allowing for reproduction
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.080]   to be removed entirely from sex.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.820]   We talked about seeking pleasure
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.460]   without the consequences in a message,
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.760]   the problem of pleasure.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.460]   That's what's going on now in the 1970s.
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.620]   In the 1980s, the internet is introduced,
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.820]   and pornography is made available to everyone.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.640]   And again, sex begins to change,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.720]   which in turn begins to change dating.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.660]   And now in the 2000s, everyone has a mobile device,
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.160]   a smartphone in their pocket.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.260]   Pornography is no longer two-dimensional images,
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.340]   it's videos.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.580]   Of the act.
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.980]   And this perversion is magnified.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.100]   And beauty is changed.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.380]   What is beautiful is now different.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.820]   It has evolved.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.780]   With the turn of every decade, beauty has changed.
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.420]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.020]   Like this is the simple truth I'm hitting you with,
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.380]   a very logical truth.
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.180]   You've been told what is beautiful.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.060]   You didn't decide on your own.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.420]   You don't know what is beautiful.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.100]   You've been told what is beautiful.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.500]   Do you get that?
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.580]   And so now the reason that we date is for an experience.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.500]   Girls often date for emotional acceptance,
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.540]   to feel that someone wants them.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.300]   Guys often date so that they can feel that adrenaline rush,
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.860]   even if there's no sex or any kind of physical thing
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.140]   involved, just feel that adrenaline rush around a girl.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.780]   And so we date, not for a family, but for an experience.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.700]   And so I'm just telling you this tonight,
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.580]   if we could change this target,
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.820]   what we put our sights on, we'd be better off.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.420]   And so the way that we combat myths is with wisdom.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.100]   The way that you combat lies is with truth.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.500]   And so we're going to turn to the book of wisdom.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.380]   This is the book written by the wisest man
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.380]   who ever lived, the wisest man in the history of the world.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.340]   And so these were Proverbs that he wrote down,
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.020]   but also Proverbs that other people wrote,
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.340]   other kings wrote, that he kept for himself.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.940]   This particular Proverb was written by King Lemuel.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.380]   And specifically, King Lemuel is reflecting on wisdom
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.860]   that he learned from his mother.
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.500]   So this is wisdom from a woman.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.220]   We're gonna be in Proverbs 31.
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.500]   Ladies, I know that many of you have a love-hate
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.820]   relationship with Proverbs 31, okay?
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.660]   I get it.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.260]   Some of you are like, if a pastor ever recites Proverbs 31
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.980]   to me ever again, I'm gonna throw up.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.420]   And others of you are like, oh, look,
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.140]   it tells me exactly, this is great.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.240]   And so I know there's all kinds of mixed emotions,
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.260]   but I'm just telling you, it's God's word.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.680]   And so we're gonna look at one verse,
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.900]   we're gonna camp on one verse tonight.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.120]   It's this, Proverbs 1:30, 31-30.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.960]   Ready?
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.780]   All you gotta do tonight is believe this verse.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.700]   That's it.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.300]   Believe it's true.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.540]   Charm is deceptive, beauty is fleeting,
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.300]   but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.260]   If everybody in here believed this verse,
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:14.780]   if every, you'd save yourself a lot of time and heartache,
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.380]   frankly, you'd save me a lot of time and heartache,
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.500]   if everyone in here just believed this verse.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.420]   And so let's start, my first point is charm is inaccurate.
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.060]   I say inaccurate because we're aiming for the right target.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.540]   Charm is going to take you off target.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.940]   Charm is inaccurate.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.620]   And so if something is inaccurate, you can't trust it.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.780]   The scripture says charm is deceitful.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.600]   What does that mean?
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.100]   Deceitful means to be misled by false appearance, okay?
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.580]   So it looks good, it looks appealing, but it's deceitful.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.460]   It intentionally deceives, okay?
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.460]   I can remember, I was brand new married,
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.940]   that was my first year of marriage.
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.980]   Green is all get out.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.980]   I was a Christian.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.020]   I did believe that Christ died for my sins
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.340]   and God raised him from the dead,
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.100]   but I was a brand new baby Christian
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.540]   and I still had a lot of old habits on me, okay?
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.700]   My wife goes out of town and I go to dinner with a friend.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.220]   And so he and I are sitting there at dinner
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.140]   and these two girls approach us,
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.660]   two very, very beautiful girls,
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.820]   something that I was not accustomed to,
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.080]   beautiful girls approaching me.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.940]   There I am and they say, "Hey,"
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.180]   and I talked to one and she says, "Can I buy you a drink?"
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.980]   To which, and so I'm like, "Wow, aggressive, okay."
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.820]   "Can you buy me?"
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.860]   And so to which I say, "I'm married."
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.580]   To which she says, "I don't care."
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.620]   And I'd love to tell you right now what I did
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.400]   is I like jumped up from the table and ran to my car
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.380]   and burned out of the parking lot.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.180]   But I didn't.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.300]   I didn't.
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.100]   My heart was flattered.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.240]   I was like, "Huh."
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.900]   Still very green, still very immature.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.780]   I was like, "Huh, you don't care."
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.140]   Still got some old habits.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.140]   And I believe as I reflected in that moment,
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.500]   one thing saved me.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.780]   And it was something that somebody had told me.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.020]   And they said, "Hey, that woman,
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.560]   "she wants to destroy you.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.220]   "She doesn't care about you, man.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.920]   "She's just looking to feel loved.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.280]   "She needs someone to help her feel loved.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.220]   "And so she wants your wife to hate you,
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.900]   "your parents to hate you, your friends to hate you,
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.740]   "your wife's parents to hate you,
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.420]   "your brother-in-law, also your best friend to hate you
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.860]   "because you would have one moment of fleeting pleasure.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.180]   "Do not be deceived by her charm."
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.700]   And that message rang true in my head.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.380]   And I thought for a moment, I thought,
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.460]   "Oh, you just need to feel wanted."
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   And I remember, "Oh, you want to destroy me."
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.640]   And that memory, I believe, saved me from that moment.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.560]   Proverbs 6 says it like this, verse 21.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.360]   For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light,
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.840]   and the corrections of discipline are the way of life,
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.920]   keeping you from the immoral woman,
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.120]   from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.840]   Do not trust in your heart after her beauty, I'm sorry,
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.160]   do not lust in your heart after her beauty
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.080]   or let her captivate you with her eyes.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.300]   And so I'm telling you, ladies,
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.460]   the charming guy can't be trusted either.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.260]   You do not trust charm, right?
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.780]   They want to destroy your marriage
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.640]   before your marriage ever happens.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.880]   So I don't care if he's calling you
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.180]   and leaving voice to men on your voicemail
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.420]   and singing "Usher" to you and reciting "Romeo and Juliet"
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.580]   and he wrote a poem to you, okay?
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.500]   You don't trust charm, right?
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.220]   You don't trust charm.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.900]   That's not what you trust.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.100]   You don't trust your feelings,
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.880]   your emotions, or your hormones, okay?
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.920]   Charm is deceptive, it is fleeting,
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.960]   and it is the selfish pursuit of an experience.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.460]   So when someone comes up to you,
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.040]   and remember, it's no longer about the family,
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.280]   so when they come up to you and they're charming,
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.860]   just say, respond with this thing.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.800]   Let me ask you a question, how many kids you want to have?
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.400]   That will usually solve the problem right there, okay?
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.180]   That's free, man, that's free.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.480]   Let's talk about dating websites for a minute, okay?
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.200]   I won't be here long, but evidently it's a hot topic.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.560]   A lot of people say, hey, will you talk about this?
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.840]   So let's talk about it for a minute.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.760]   Matt, I don't know.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.960]   I mean, there's not, there's not a thou shalt not
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.080]   e-harmony, you know, in the scripture, all right?
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.560]   So what do I do?
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.960]   Here's what I would tell you.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.920]   Be wise, make sure your community is aware,
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.640]   those around you are aware, and here's what I would tell you.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.760]   This is a game where you want to remove the disadvantages.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.280]   Okay, as quickly as you can, any kind of disadvantages
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.320]   between you and where you're going,
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.640]   you want to remove those disadvantages.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.400]   And I'll just tell you that everyone is cooler
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.440]   on the internet, right?
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.920]   And so everyone is cooler in their profile
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.080]   than they are in real life,
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.040]   and technology puts advantages between you.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.420]   And so let me say this to you guys.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.720]   Stop asking girls out by text, amen?
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.840]   (congregation cheering)
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.680]   Yeah, I got that, I got that article sent to me
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.500]   like 16 times this week, so I read the article.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.320]   We're good, and guys, we're good.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.240]   Like, just don't do that anymore, okay?
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.120]   'Cause that's lame, we're good.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:10.960]   We're gonna move past it.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.240]   That has nothing to do with my talk, that's free too.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.000]   Okay, my second point tonight,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.800]   love at first sight is a miss.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.840]   Remember, we're talking about this target,
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.320]   and so love at first sight, like I saw her and I loved her,
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.840]   I saw him and I loved him, he had this six pack
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.040]   that's not gonna be there very long.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.840]   Okay, love at first sight is a miss.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.920]   The scripture says beauty is fleeting.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.260]   That's all it is, listen, all you gotta do is trust that.
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.160]   Beauty is fleeting.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.280]   By the way, that's true.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.060]   Historically, biologically, scientifically,
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.960]   beauty is fleeting.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.400]   You tracking with me?
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.980]   What am I saying?
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.280]   We're all getting uglier.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.240]   No, no, no, see, I just get paid to speak truth.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.400]   Like, it's just true, guys.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.480]   Everybody thinks they're here,
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.080]   no, I'm gonna be the hot 50-year-old.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.600]   No, you're not, not one of you.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.680]   Statistically, not, no, you don't understand,
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.520]   I'm gonna work out.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.220]   No, you're not, you're not gonna work out,
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.120]   you're gonna hurt your joints in the gym
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.240]   and you're not gonna be able to work out anymore.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.360]   That's what's gonna happen.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.320]   It happens over and over.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.960]   No, no, no, I'm gonna get plastic surgery.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   Okay, listen, that worked out maybe for a little,
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.240]   yeah, about 10 years on that, okay?
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.040]   It's fleeting.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   It's going away, it's diminishing, okay?
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.800]   And so what if you, who are you?
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.240]   What does this say about the guy who walks through the porch
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.820]   who sees the girl, goes up to her,
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.160]   the hot girl, right, goes up to her
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.120]   and asks her for her number.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.560]   What does that say about you?
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.400]   It says you're a sixth grader.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.440]   Okay, you're a sixth grader.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:51.080]   It says that I know that what you have is vanishing.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.840]   I'm not looking for a long time,
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.480]   I'm looking for a good time.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.360]   That's what it says about you.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.600]   I'm not looking for a long,
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.200]   I don't know anything about your character,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.600]   I don't know if you love Jesus,
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.620]   I don't know who you are or where you come from,
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.600]   but I know you look good
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.880]   and so I was wondering if I could have your number.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.200]   Okay, I used to do that in the sixth grade,
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.400]   walking through the mall.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.880]   Just being authentic here.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:22.080]   So if you invest, if you invest in fleeting things,
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.440]   like anybody, some of you are in the financial world,
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.720]   if you invest in things that are fleeting,
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.800]   it's diminishing returns.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.700]   Like you're losing money from day one.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.440]   But if you invest in godly character,
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.200]   it pays dividends the rest of your life.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.640]   The rest of your life.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.080]   It's just good investment.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.800]   That's just good investing, okay?
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   And so ladies, this is what I would tell you,
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.560]   you want looks that last.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.620]   And what I mean, I'm not talking about Botox
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.360]   or facelifts or boob jobs,
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.880]   I'm talking about looks that last,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.540]   looks from him that last.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.560]   A guy who looks at your character,
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.540]   he's going to look at you like you're beautiful
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.720]   the rest of your life.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.600]   When your beauty fades, and it will fade,
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.260]   he's still gonna look at you like you're beautiful.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.120]   You want looks that last.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.420]   So don't attract him with Botox and a boob job
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.440]   and a facelift and a butt that looks good in those jeans,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.760]   okay, because those things are gonna go away,
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.940]   and when they do, he's gonna go away.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:23.200]   And you don't have to trust me.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.600]   See, there's like a part of me going into the night
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.640]   that I'm just like, man, they're just not gonna believe me.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.120]   And I actually prayed through that,
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.200]   and I was like, God, they're not gonna believe me.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.360]   He said, oh, they're gonna believe you.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.520]   Maybe just not tonight.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.200]   So that's the piece I have in this message.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.840]   Every single one of you are gonna know it's true one day.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.440]   Every one of you are gonna know it's true.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:52.900]   And so ladies, you get a guy with your good looks,
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.120]   you're gonna lose him when those looks fade,
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.480]   and the problem with that is,
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.480]   is I think a lot of you ladies,
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.840]   when you hear me say that, you think,
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.360]   you don't think, oh yeah, he's right.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.520]   You think, no, I'll just stay looking good.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.600]   Good luck with that.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.120]   First Peter 3:3 says,
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.240]   your beauty should not come from outward adornment, period.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.440]   You tracking with me?
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.280]   See, your beauty should not come from outward adornment.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.120]   It's just in the scripture.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.940]   It's black and white.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:23.780]   It's not even complicated.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.400]   Like, I don't need to exegete the Greek on that.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.960]   Your beauty should not come from outward adornment.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.800]   You're gonna leave here and like,
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.080]   does my butt look good in these jeans?
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.800]   No, it shouldn't come from outward adornment,
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.120]   but from something inside, and I know,
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.320]   you're tired of waiting on those guys
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.360]   and you see the girls getting ahead.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.200]   I get it.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.840]   You're tired of always being the bridesmaid,
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.680]   never the bride.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.240]   I get it.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.560]   I don't really get it, but.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:55.640]   See, like I said earlier,
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.080]   you've been told what is beautiful,
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.040]   and it's just true because like in researching this message,
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:00.880]   like it's evolved.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.160]   Like there was a day, you know,
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.420]   even when Song of Solomon was written,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.360]   when like super fair skinned,
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.800]   what was most attractive,
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.760]   like the fairer your skin,
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.940]   no matter what your ethnicity was,
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.920]   the fairer your skin, the more attractive,
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.200]   and slightly plump, and I don't know how else to say that,
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.800]   but that's what was attractive, okay?
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   And so like in that day, in Solomon's day,
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.580]   if you'd have told him there's gonna be a Palm Beach tan
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.320]   on the corner, they'd have been like, what?
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.160]   That's crazy.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.720]   They'd pay you to get uglier, you know?
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.320]   'Cause that was just the day, right?
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.320]   It's evolved.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.560]   You've been told.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.440]   You've been duped.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.480]   Media has told you what is beautiful,
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.760]   and so it's evolving.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.600]   Do you remember the anorexic look of the '80s
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.720]   and the early '90s?
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.000]   And now where it's headed, and I want you to hear why.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.860]   Where it's headed, I think the more of what is going to be
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.560]   the epitome of beauty is now kind of the porn star, okay?
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.040]   The huge kind of unnatural curves, if you will,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.960]   if you're tracking with me there.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.720]   That's what's gonna be the epitome of beauty.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.560]   Why?
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.800]   Because men are telling you what's beautiful.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.640]   Why?
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.940]   Because you're letting them.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:05.440]   Okay?
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.400]   Because as they say, hey, this is what we like,
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.440]   you say, okay, this is what we'll give you.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.440]   And you say, but JP, that's 'cause I'm tired of waiting,
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.000]   and they're winning.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.900]   You can trust God.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.320]   Okay, if I didn't know anything else about God,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.260]   I know one thing.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.680]   I know that we can trust him.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.360]   You can be with him a lot longer than you're here.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.000]   And you can pursue him and love him
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.680]   and find satisfaction in him,
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.240]   which I know can be difficult in seasons.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.160]   But I'm just telling you, he's just telling you,
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.920]   a relationship built on beauty won't last.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.840]   How do I know this?
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.240]   We can pursue this with logic, like God said it,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.060]   but I can answer, I can respond with logic.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.960]   Because who are the most beautiful, sexiest,
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.240]   wealthiest people alive?
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.360]   Where can we look for that?
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.200]   Hollywood.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.720]   Who also has the highest divorce rate?
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.640]   Let me just read a few.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.040]   Ryan Filippi, Reese Witherspoon, Brad Pitt,
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.960]   Jennifer Aniston, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes,
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.200]   Chris Robinson, Kate Hudson, Seal, and Heidi Klum,
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.520]   Usher and Tamika Foster, Chris Humphries and Kim Kardashian,
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.560]   Charlie Sheen, Denise Richards, Guy Ritchie and Madonna,
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.920]   Mark Anthony and Jennifer Lopez.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.840]   It's a really long list.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.000]   Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, Katie Perry,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.280]   Russell Brandt, Peter Wentz, Ashley Simpson,
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.300]   Jessica Simpson, David Arquette, Courtney Cox,
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.560]   Tony Parker, Eva Longoria.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.480]   I can go on and on.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.320]   It's a really long list.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.200]   I'll stop right there.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.960]   You track with me?
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.800]   How does that work?
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.360]   Who are the sexiest, wealthiest,
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.080]   most beautiful people on the planet?
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.580]   How's it working out for them?
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.440]   Like if it was about that,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.280]   we would turn to them and say,
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.300]   look how great their marriages are.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.040]   Like that's what I want, right?
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.220]   See, sometimes people are beautiful
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.240]   because they're at the center of their world.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   Like sometimes he's got everything kind of stacked up right
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.480]   'cause he's worked really hard for that.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.840]   The reason he's worked really hard for that
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.240]   is 'cause he likes the way it looks in the mirror.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.040]   He's at the center.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.840]   Sometimes she has everything stacked up just right, right?
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.000]   'Cause she's at the center of her world.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.320]   I'd be really cautious about that, okay?
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.240]   And then sometimes,
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:17.400]   sometimes we pursue that
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.180]   because we want the experience.
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.420]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.920]   Just gonna throw it out there.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.180]   Is sex better with a beautiful person?
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:33.820]   Don't shout out your answer.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.820]   Okay, my guess is the room would be divided.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.740]   You can just think on it.
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.280]   I'll tell you, here's what I tell you.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.700]   This is the truth I lean on.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.860]   Marriage is better with a faithful person.
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.460]   Marriage is better with a committed person,
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.340]   with a person of character all day long.
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:59.300]   Some of you are so addicted to the experience
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.060]   that you've got some really bad habits.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:07.060]   And so you watch the soap opera and you say, I want that.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.540]   I like the drama.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.660]   It's really crazy, but I met with enough of you to know this.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.500]   Your life, in a way that some kind of subconscious
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.420]   or a way you can't help, you are addicted to drama.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.580]   So you have what's called a savior complex
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.060]   and you see him and you know that he gets in fights
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.820]   and he's no good, but some reason,
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.460]   you wish your heart wasn't, you're attracted to that.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.880]   And in some people, maybe he even gets in fights with you.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.580]   Maybe he gets physical with you and you're attracted to that.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.260]   And I'm just saying, hey, something's broken,
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.380]   something's off, and I'm not calling you out.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.100]   I'm saying, hey, we're here to help you.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.100]   All I need you to do is get the courage and say,
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.300]   yeah, man, something's a little off in me, man.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.100]   I'm attracted to these guys, no good for me.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.380]   Will you help me?
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.200]   And we will.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.160]   And guys, like you go after the drama queens.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.200]   Okay, most of you know, you run from the drama queens,
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.160]   but some of you, you're like, I like that.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.240]   She's crazy, that's what I like.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.640]   Eminem says it like this.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.720]   One of my favorite theologians.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.200]   I can't tell you what it is.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.560]   I can only tell you what it feels like.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.720]   And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.160]   I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.640]   As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.600]   High off of love, drunk off of my hate.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.760]   It's like I'm huffing paint, and I love it
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.360]   the more I suffer.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.160]   I suffocate, and right before I'm about to drown,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.360]   she resuscitates me, she really hates me, and I love it.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.480]   Some of you, you heard that song, you're like, yeah.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.440]   That's true.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.200]   But this is, this is what the scripture says.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.840]   This is what the wisest man ever lived.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.680]   This is what he wrote.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.240]   It's gonna be, I'm gonna go in order, okay?
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.960]   Starting with Proverbs 19, verse 13.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.600]   A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.120]   Proverbs 21, verse nine.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.800]   Better to live on the corner of a roof
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.720]   than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.240]   Proverbs 21, 19.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.360]   Better to live in a desert, this is straight from the word,
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.280]   okay, better to live in a desert
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.600]   than with a quarrelsome wife and an ill-tempered wife.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.360]   Proverbs 25, verse 24.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.100]   Better to live on the corner of the roof
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.680]   than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.600]   It's in there twice.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.560]   Proverbs 27, 15.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.600]   A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.760]   on a rainy day.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.040]   And then we get to this proverb, where we're at today.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.400]   It's Proverbs 31, it's called a wife of noble character,
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.220]   and it says this.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.040]   A wife of noble character, who can find?
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.840]   She is worth far more than rubies.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.880]   And so when I'm calling you to,
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.080]   what God's word is calling you to,
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.400]   what someone who loves you very much is calling you to,
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.120]   men, women, aim at godly character.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.060]   Aim at godly character.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.220]   Put your crosshairs, put your sights on godly character.
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.540]   And so what does noble mean?
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.620]   It's not a word we use a lot.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.340]   It means having or showing qualities
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.260]   of high moral character, such as courage,
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.860]   generosity, or honor.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.860]   Okay, these are what you look for.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.900]   Last Thursday, I picked my little girl up from school,
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.460]   Presley, she's in kindergarten, she's five.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.140]   And she's telling me about her friend Avery,
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.740]   and she's like, "Daddy, Avery taught me this,
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.100]   "and Avery taught me that,
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.020]   "and do you know what infinity means, Daddy?
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.780]   "Avery told me what infinity means,
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.020]   "and this and that."
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.820]   And I was like, "Well, cool.
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.740]   "How long have you been friends with her?"
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.440]   And she goes, "No, Avery's a boy."
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.180]   Oh man.
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.740]   Okay, it sounded like y'all talked a lot.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.940]   Is Avery your boyfriend?
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:33.780]   No.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.800]   Presley, do you have a boyfriend?
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   Yes.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.220]   I can't breathe.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.220]   What's his name?
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.900]   I don't know his name.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.660]   It's funny when you're five,
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.900]   you don't know that names are important in relationships.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:00.220]   But what I'm saying tonight is I think when we're 25,
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.060]   we still don't know what's important in relationships.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.320]   When we're 35, we still don't know
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.820]   what's important in relationships.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.780]   Like God's word just says, black and white,
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.740]   it's just like it's plain as day, right?
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:13.140]   Charm is deceitful, beauty is fleeting,
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.540]   but a woman who fears the Lord, that's what you want.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.900]   Find you a woman who fears the Lord.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:19.780]   What does it mean to fear the Lord?
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.980]   It means to obey his command.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.700]   That's what it means, to obey his command.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.860]   It means to follow his command.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.060]   Let me tell you like this.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.380]   Ladies, a guy, the reason that he'll put his hand
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.820]   up your shirt or down your pants, it's for one reason.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.340]   He's not scared of God.
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.320]   That's it, it's the only reason.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.620]   You tracking with me?
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.660]   The reason he's saying, hey, can I come in?
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.300]   And you're saying, no, he's like, come on, what's the--
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.980]   It's because he doesn't fear God.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.380]   Okay?
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.180]   And ladies, that's back on you too.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.580]   If you're saying, if you're inviting that in,
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.780]   like it's only one reason.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.180]   It's like, God, I'm not scared of you.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.860]   I don't need to obey your word.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.260]   You don't know what's best for me.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.980]   All it means to fear God is to trust
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.680]   that he knows what's best for you.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.680]   That he sets you here and he's giving you rules
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.120]   that leads to life.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:20.080]   And so, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.480]   Guys don't believe this.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.760]   One of the reasons that guys don't believe this, ladies,
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.920]   okay, I don't mean to come on hard at the ladies.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.400]   I mean, guys, I could yell at you all night,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.120]   but ladies, one of the reasons that guys don't believe this
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.720]   is 'cause you don't believe this.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.720]   Like you can nod right now.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.480]   You can be like, oh yeah, fears the Lord, yeah.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.480]   And then you're like, man, I wish I had her body.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.360]   So you don't believe it.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.320]   Man, I wish I looked like her.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.520]   Comparison, the thief of all joy.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.360]   Let me say it again, comparison is the thief of all joy.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.920]   You look at her, man, I wish I had her hair.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.080]   I wish I had her eyes.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.120]   I wish I had her chest.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.400]   Wish I had those legs.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.520]   You don't believe it.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.040]   You ever, man, I wish I feared God like she does, you know?
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.880]   I wish I knew the word like she,
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.840]   I wish I was committed like she is.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:22.920]   So let me just clarify some things and we'll wrap up.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.760]   History doesn't disqualify you, okay?
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.560]   So I don't care if you've had 127 sexual partners,
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.960]   had abortions, that doesn't disqualify you.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.520]   Christ makes you know, we know that.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.200]   And so history doesn't disqualify you,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.520]   but your reputation does, okay?
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.800]   And reputation's not today, right?
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.160]   Reputation's a season.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.500]   And so you wanna walk faithfully for a season.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.080]   Okay, I'm talking to you guys too.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.920]   Like I don't give you, man,
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.200]   maybe you've been a player, a cheat.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.640]   You're not disqualified,
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.920]   but it's time to surrender everything,
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.480]   to set the crosshairs on Jesus.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.240]   Say, Jesus, I wanna follow you.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.760]   I believe you died for my sins.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.280]   I believe you covered them, they're behind me.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.880]   That's not who I am anymore.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.600]   My identity's now in you and I'm gonna walk
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.960]   as a new creation, Paul writes.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.240]   I'm gonna walk in a new life.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.840]   I'm your son, I'm your daughter.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.060]   And so some of you, you hear this and you wanna date,
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:17.900]   but you don't need to date.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.920]   You need to take a season and you need to pursue Jesus.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.200]   And as I say that, your heart might be saying to you,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.760]   I hope he's not talking about me, and I know he is.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.360]   So let me just say this again.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.840]   Some of you, you don't need to date right now.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.800]   You need to go out and kind of mark
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.680]   in your Microsoft Outlook calendar,
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.640]   like six months or a year, and say,
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.840]   hey, I'm gonna take this time
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.340]   and I'm just gonna pursue you.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.040]   And I trust in your timing.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.720]   You know, that you'll ignite that in me
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.060]   or allow me to do that again through the context
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.060]   of community and the wisdom from others.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.720]   Okay, but some of you, if you are ready,
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   this is what I want you to do.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.000]   It's a real simple application.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.880]   It's a fun application.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.440]   I think you're gonna like it, okay?
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.460]   It's this simple, guys.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.040]   If you're here and you're like, man, I love Jesus,
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.400]   I'm ready to date, this is what I want you to do, okay?
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.300]   This simple.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.980]   I want you to think of the most godly woman you know.
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.960]   This simple, think of her.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.800]   Who is she?
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.620]   The most godly woman you know.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.320]   Now, this is assuming you're not in a relationship.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.280]   I know some of you are.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.600]   And so if you're in a relationship,
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.960]   you can kind of audit your relationship
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.040]   based on these values.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.120]   And so if you're here and you're not in a relationship,
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.220]   you think of the most godly person you know, okay?
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.060]   The most godly person you know.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.780]   Guys, I'm talking to you, and I want you to ask her out.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.020]   That's it.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.300]   I'm not asking her to marry you.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.460]   Just ask her to coffee.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.540]   And you can ask her for this purpose.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.780]   I mean, I wanna know kind of what,
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.180]   you know, how did you get godly?
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.280]   Like, what makes you godly?
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.520]   And how do you trust God?
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.780]   And just get to know her.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.020]   And ladies, this is for you now.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.160]   If you're here and you're not in a relationship,
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.460]   if a godly guy asks you out, okay?
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.980]   If a godly guy asks you out, and you know he's godly,
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.740]   I want you to say, okay, yeah,
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.460]   we can go and coffee one time.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.820]   We can do that, I will get to know you better, right?
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.020]   And so what I'm saying, like guys are like,
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.140]   well, I want a tall girl, a short girl,
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.940]   blonde girl, brunette girl, blue eyes, right?
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.580]   I want you to throw that out the window for a minute
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.980]   and set it on godliness.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.760]   Okay, godly character.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.540]   If a godly guy asks you out, I just want you to give him
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.260]   a shot, it's one date, okay?
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.800]   Now, if he's not godly, okay?
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.780]   Let me say this first.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.780]   If you don't know if he's godly, like you say,
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.540]   well, how do I know, he's at the porch,
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.620]   that does not mean he's godly, okay?
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.820]   And so if you don't know, you say this,
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.460]   you say, you know what?
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.520]   This tall, goofy guy told me that if you're godly,
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.360]   that I'm supposed to say yes.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.780]   And so I don't know if you're godly,
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.200]   so I just need some time to kind of figure that out.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.780]   That's it, it's that simple.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.160]   You look him in the eyes, you say, hey, you know what?
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.940]   I don't know you well enough to agree to that.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.740]   And so I just need some time to kind of
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.820]   check your references, if you will.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.860]   He'll love that, okay?
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.620]   All right, now, if he's not godly, what do you do then?
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.380]   You make up an excuse, you say, well, I can't
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.780]   because I gotta go change my sock drawer.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:37:59.940]   No, you don't, okay?
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.860]   You don't do that.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.660]   Now, listen, this is important, ladies,
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.620]   'cause a lot of you have missed this.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.100]   So I'm gonna give you some good, sound wisdom here.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:11.220]   If you don't think he's godly, you tell him that.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.940]   Whoa, what a, no, you want me to be truthful?
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.820]   You look him in the eyes, and you say no,
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.100]   and you say, here's why.
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.020]   I've seen some things in your character
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.340]   inconsistent with that of Jesus,
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.320]   and so I'm not interested.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.020]   I can't say that, you couldn't be honest?
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.180]   That's what you're saying, I can't be honest.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.580]   That's crazy.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.780]   Ladies, you can be honest.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.180]   I think we've taken this word submissive
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.020]   to mean, like, I can't be truthful.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.700]   I wanna empower you to be truthful, okay?
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:44.900]   You can be truthful.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.960]   That's it, that's the application tonight.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.400]   I'm serious, this week, every guy here.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.080]   Like, next week, y'all should be on a date.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   Everyone here should be on a date at the porch.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.640]   Okay, if you're here, you're ready to date,
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.480]   you ask, you think of the godliest girl you know,
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.320]   and you ask her out.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.840]   And you say, JP, I want both.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.280]   I want beautiful and godly.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.920]   You say, like, maybe it looks like this.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.360]   You're like, well, I mean, I need to be attracted to her
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.960]   to spend some time with her.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.280]   No, you don't, you need to spend some time with her
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.160]   to find out if you're attracted to her.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.480]   Remember, like, I'll tell you,
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.880]   some of the healthiest marriages I know,
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.560]   their story's like, man, we were serving together,
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.760]   and I wasn't interested in him at all.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.520]   But now, it's like this crazy healthy marriage.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.200]   Sometimes God just does something, okay?
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.400]   Let me say it like this.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:40.280]   Let me just invite you into the Pucluta household, okay?
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.680]   So we'll go last night.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.600]   So my wife, she's sick, okay?
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.960]   It's kind of been going around, this flu-like thing,
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.800]   and so my wife is sick, my three-year-old is sick, okay?
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.360]   And so, like, I'm being stopped up,
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.640]   like, just no energy, running a fever.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.360]   Okay, we got a four-month-old at home, okay?
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.040]   And then we got a five-year-old at home,
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.560]   and so my five-year-old, right,
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.460]   like, she has to, she's in kindergarten,
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.840]   she has a homework assignment, she has to write a book.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.280]   I'm like, what, write a book?
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.800]   Literally, she has to write a five-page ABC book
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.000]   on animals, draw the animals, illustrate it, and everything,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.240]   and so I'm sitting there,
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.800]   I'm sitting there trying to help her do this.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.360]   Monica's like, hey, can you pick up Weston?
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.200]   Weston's crying.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.480]   I pick up Weston, I'm like, hey,
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.800]   you know, I'm doing that beatbox thing
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.320]   that sometimes I'll post on Facebook.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.160]   I'm doing that, and he just,
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.800]   bleh, projectile vomits all over me, okay?
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.040]   Like, the nasty, sticky, white stuff
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.320]   hits me right here and runs down my shirt and my jeans,
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.280]   and I'm grossed out by that, by the way, okay?
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.600]   So, like, I'm not the cool dad.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.700]   I'm like, oh, take him, take him, take him!
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.120]   And so Finley's crying because she's sick,
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.360]   and Monica's not feeling well, and Presley needs help,
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.680]   and now Weston's crying.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.640]   This is all happening last night, okay?
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.680]   And then we go to bed.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.440]   Let me tell you something, Weston's teething.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.180]   So he's up four times last night, four different times,
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.120]   and when he wasn't up, my sick three-year-old, she's up.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.020]   And so they were trading off.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.640]   It's like they communicated, hey, I'll get up,
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.920]   and then when I go back, when they go back to sleep,
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.240]   then you start crying, okay?
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.880]   And so then she's like, okay, Finley, you okay?
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.480]   And then, Weston, okay, you okay?
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.440]   Now, Finley, you okay?
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.280]   And so we're doing that.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.100]   Let me tell you something.
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.680]   I don't need a trophy wife.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.480]   I need someone to go to war with me.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.580]   You tracking with that?
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.080]   I need someone to step into battle with me.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.440]   Like, that's cool and all, you know?
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.320]   Hey, that was fun, you know?
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.360]   You looked good in a bikini,
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.960]   but now it's time to go to war, okay?
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.180]   I just got vomited on, you know?
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:31.220]   And I'm just telling you, it's logic.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.960]   That is where you're headed, okay?
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.040]   And it's funny because the family,
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.220]   we no longer value that.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.560]   I'm telling you, in America,
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.800]   people are getting married exponentially less
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.160]   than they ever have, and they're having less kids,
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.640]   so much so, they're saying America won't sustain itself
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.320]   because people aren't having children.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.140]   Why?
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.560]   Because we're selfish and self-absorbed
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.520]   more so than we ever did.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.400]   We're pursuing pleasure more than we ever have,
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.240]   and listen to this one.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.280]   This was the most interesting.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.320]   We're the most depressed we've ever been.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.480]   Do you get that?
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.540]   It's logic.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.240]   We've shifted off of God's values.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.680]   It's that simple.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.620]   We say, man, I wanna be about me.
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.500]   And it ends tragically.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.840]   See, some of you guys,
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.160]   some of you guys know guys pursuing godly girls.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.480]   You're like, man, what's he doing?
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.680]   She's not that hot.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.920]   What's he doing with her?
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.320]   You think he's missing the target.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.720]   You don't know, man, he's drilling it.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.680]   He's hitting that little character
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.480]   to the up and to the left, just killing it, okay?
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.240]   Let me pray.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:42.240]  , God, I think they're wrestling with this right now.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:43:01.400]   You love 'em more than I do even.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:08.440]   And so, Father, in your Holy Spirit, in your power,
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.320]   would you take that what is true
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.600]   and would you stir it in their hearts
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.720]   and not let 'em shake it?
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.040]   Like some of them, they know that they're dating
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.520]   someone no good for 'em, and so would you give 'em
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.520]   the courage to have that conversation tonight?
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.080]   Say, hey, man, we're done here.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.920]   Some of them have made compromises
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.640]   that they need to ask each other's forgiveness,
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.200]   and I pray that you let them do that.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.840]   Confess it in context of community
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.880]   and move on to higher ground.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:41.340]   Some of them know that they've been pursuing
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.300]   the wrong things, and I just pray that in your power,
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.280]   you would help them reset the sights, reset the scope.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.000]   Aim at the right target.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.320]   And Father, for all of us, I pray that we would pursue Christ
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.460]   more than a spouse, even my married friends,
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:05.740]   even us, help us to pursue you more than our spouse,
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.480]   that you would be ultimate.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.960]   Father, I thank you that we are all gonna be
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:15.960]   well married one day to your perfect bridegroom,
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.400]   to your perfect son.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.600]   Help us to hope in that.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.120]   Man, that's just what you guys need to hear.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.740]   Some of you, I know that you're forgiven.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.960]   Every stupid thing you've done,
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.220]   every wicked thing you've done,
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.820]   if you've trusted Jesus died for it,
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:38.740]   that's what it takes.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.500]   I know there's some whack theology out there
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.540]   saying some other things, but it's this simple.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:48.540]   He died for all your sins, or he died for none of your sins.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:52.980]   He purchased your way to God.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:57.860]   And if you trust in that, then you're a new creation.
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.640]   And the crazy thing about new creations
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.240]   is they do new things.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.360]   And so instead of being tempted to pursue yourself
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.520]   and tempted to pursue those things
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.440]   that have brought death to your life, pursue new things.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.880]   Pursue the abundant life Christ came to bring.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.080]   It's John 10, 10.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.280]   It's from the scripture.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.320]   And so I just want you to leave here.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.760]   Remember the application, don't forget it.
