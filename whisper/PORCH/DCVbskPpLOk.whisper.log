[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:30.440]  , [CHEERING]
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.920]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.240]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.520]   So I got a new car.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.400]   Got a new car, which warrants a story.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.080]   Got to tell you the story.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.560]   And so if we don't know each other, if you're new here,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.200]   that's not normal, by the way.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.600]   If you're listening on the podcast,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   the audios are just pulled out in a car.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.760]   And so I have-- like my hobby, what
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.640]   I've done for the longest time is I buy and sell things.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.680]   I've always done this.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.840]   And so that's just kind of like some guys crochet,
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.760]   some guys watch football.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.600]   Do guys crochet?
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.120]   No guys crochet.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.200]   So I buy and sell things.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.160]   That's my hobby.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.880]   And so I had this golf cart.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.480]   True story.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.600]   Had a golf cart.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.320]   Had it on Craigslist.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.320]   And this guy reaches out and said, hey,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.960]   I'll trade you for a Toyota Corolla.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.360]   And I'm like, golf cart for a Toyota Corolla?
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.000]   Sure, I'll take that trade.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600]   And so then I have the Toyota Corolla, and I sell it.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.400]   And so then I take that cash, and I'm looking for, OK,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520]   where am I going to put that cash?
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.640]   Because this is kind of my side hustle, right?
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.360]   This is my pastor side hustle.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.720]   And so I'm looking for where I'm going to put that cash.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.800]   I'm looking at different things, and I see that.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.080]   And I'm like, dude, got to have that, right?
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.760]   Got to have it.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.560]   And I'm talking to the guy.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.600]   I'm like, I can't afford that, though, right?
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.480]   And he gives me the craziest deal, like craziest deal
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.040]   that you could ever imagine.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.360]   So here's what I'm feeling.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.760]   I'm like, OK, my heart has already moved that direction.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.600]   Like, I got to have it, right?
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.800]   And now, because of the deal, I'm thinking, hey,
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.320]   I've got limited time.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.320]   Like, I got to lock this up, right?
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.200]   And the reason I start there is because as we're
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.240]   moving through this fantasy series,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.280]   we're talking about finding real love in a fake world.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.960]   Last week, we talked about the fantasy girl
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.440]   out of Proverbs 31.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.840]   Tonight, we're talking about the fantasy guy.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.720]   I'm talking to the ladies.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.160]   And what I think--
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.200]   are the ladies here?
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.880]   Did they show up?
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.120]   [CHEERING]
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.520]   Do you all want to do that again?
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.000]   Because last week-- I'm going to be honest.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.480]   I think the guys beat you last week.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.520]   Did the ladies show up?
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.280]   [CHEERING]
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.120]   They showed up.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.640]   They showed up.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.400]   Ladies, here's something that I think you do, right?
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.280]   I think you know what you're looking for.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.480]   I said about the guys last week, I said,
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.840]   you guys don't know what you're looking for.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.920]   Ladies, I think you know what you're looking for.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.040]   I think you do, OK, to your credit.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.600]   I think you know what you're looking for.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.400]   But when you see something that you really like,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   it's all out the window, OK?
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.240]   Like, your heart is gone.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.880]   And you stop looking.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.120]   You stop thinking, right?
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.720]   You stop thinking with your brain.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.620]   You start thinking with your heart.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.120]   And you-- ladies are weird.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.800]   Like, there's this thing about y'all.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.440]   You're not weird.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.100]   I love you guys.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.280]   But here's the deal.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.240]   This is weird about you.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.840]   You're kind of competitive.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.400]   I almost think you're more competitive than guys.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.360]   And so it's like you think, I got to lock him up
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.280]   before anybody can get to him, you know?
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.920]   Like, nobody's going to get this deal, you know what I'm saying?
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.360]   And so it's just-- you start thinking like that.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.640]   Like, hey, I'm going to--
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.360]   OK.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.820]   And you begin to think, because if I don't go here,
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.140]   what if nothing else comes along?
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.940]   And you begin to play these mental games.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.820]   So I go to pick up the slingshot.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.700]   It's what's called a slingshot.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.380]   Appropriately called the slingshot.
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.700]   And so I go to pick up this thing, OK?
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.940]   And the day-- like, day one, check engine light comes on.
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.120]   And then-- yeah, yeah, Craigslist.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.860]   And then I'm driving, and it says, brake failure.
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.320]   Yeah, I'm surprised it's still here.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.220]   Brake failure.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.260]   I was like praying for you guys in the front row.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.940]   I was just--
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.460]   Lord, please, make it stop.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.340]   So then I go, and I'm calling places to--
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.620]   OK, here's the truth.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.780]   This is not an overstatement.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.260]   There's not a single place in Dallas, Texas
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.420]   that works on that.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.860]   Not a single place.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.740]   Not one, OK?
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.900]   I eventually, after calling seven different dealerships,
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.660]   I find they refer me to a place in Irving
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.620]   that will work on it.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.940]   And so then he says--
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.740]   he goes, here's the deal.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.380]   He goes, here's the deal.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.260]   I'm like, hey, the check engine light came on.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.040]   This brake failure.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.360]   Can you give me an idea of what it's going to be to repair?
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.220]   And he goes, well, it could be $10,000.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.760]   And I'm like, $10,000?
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.720]   That's more than I pay.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.520]   I can't-- what are you--
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.400]   are you serious?
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.320]   It could be $10,000?
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.840]   And then he says this.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.720]   He goes, you should have brought it in.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.320]   We could have done one of our six-point checks, checkups.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.100]   We could have done one of our inspections.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.600]   We'd go through these six points.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.560]   We could have told you.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.300]   I was like, oh, man, I'm so sorry.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.920]   That's exactly what I should have--
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.320]   why didn't I know that there's this place in Irving that
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.000]   works on slingshots so I could bring it
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.320]   in for a six-point checkup?
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.240]   You know, what was I thinking, buddy?
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.240]   That's what I should have done, OK?
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.320]   And so I say that to you because, ladies, when
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.320]   your heart goes out the window, it's gone.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.800]   I think that you could back up by not just being so moved
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.400]   by the way someone looks--
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.280]   the way someone looks or some other things
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.660]   that you're attracted to-- and you
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.540]   can begin to think, continue to think with your mind,
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.180]   and go through a six-point checklist.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.460]   In fact, I'm going to give it to you tonight.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.140]   A six-point checklist, six things
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.540]   that you can inspect to see if he is God's man.
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.700]   We said last week--
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.860]   I said my friend Daniel said this--
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.320]   that dating is assessing the suitability
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.780]   of a possible spouse.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.660]   That's what dating is.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.580]   You're trying to figure out, hey,
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.660]   are they someone that I can be married to?
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.740]   Are they someone that I can spend the rest of my life with?
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.980]   And this is a very practical, very logical thing.
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.740]   You can just run through and think through these ideas.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.800]   And so I'm going to be in 1 Timothy chapter 3
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.900]   to talk about what you are looking for.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.400]   But before I do, I want you to know
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.420]   we did a little bit of research for this message.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.660]   We went to the State Fair of Texas,
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.700]   and we asked ladies what they were looking for.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.940]   And so this is what they said.
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.440]   Watch this.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.340]   Hey, guys.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.980]   Josh and Elaine out here at the State Fair.
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.600]   And we're here trying to figure out how people navigate life,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.260]   love, relationships.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.500]   Dating, their dream guy, their dream girl.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.460]   Let's figure it out.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.460]   Describe to me your dream guy.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.500]   Probably like a nerd.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.940]   I love nerds.
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.300]   They have to be into anime and comic books.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.660]   Sexy.
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.780]   He's rich.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.500]   Honest.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   And he's sweet.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.900]   Like a dog.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.980]   You know how if a dog sees somebody that they don't know,
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.140]   they're really mean?
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.380]   But they're really loyal to their-- yeah,
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.140]   I want him to be like my dog.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.820]   Interesting and driven.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.620]   But I don't know.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.300]   It's also funny and has the same long-term goals.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.420]   There's not a dream guy.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.940]   It's just-- like, looks-wise, or just like,
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.180]   you have to have a good heart.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.980]   That's number one.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.260]   My dream look guy is not actually
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.420]   the guy I'm going to marry.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.460]   Not that I don't think my fiance's attractive.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.020]   I do.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.020]   What do you mean by rich?
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.260]   Let's say like $5 million and up.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.420]   He doesn't have to have $5 million.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.820]   But I mean, you know, enough to be comfortable.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.540]   You know, like--
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.220]   A job and income, I guess.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.860]   The bar is literally on the floor.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.260]   Yeah, it is.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.380]   [END PLAYBACK]
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.780]   We got some work to do.
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.700]   That's called job security right there.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.460]   Young Adult Ministry, job security, right?
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.220]   OK, ladies, here's the deal.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.980]   Here's what I want you to know.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.860]   Us guys, we are really good about getting
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.140]   your heart involved so that you're not
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.820]   thinking with your mind.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.700]   We're pros at it.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.160]   OK, I'm letting you in on a secret.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.580]   Guys, I'm sorry to let this out.
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.900]   Right up top, I know some of you are like,
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.940]   why are you telling them?
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.060]   Why are you telling them?
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.460]   You got to know, ladies, OK?
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.180]   I have to.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.940]   As a pastor, I got to let you know that we are pros.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.460]   We've been training since the fifth grade
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.780]   about how to get your heart involved so that you're not
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.900]   thinking with your mind.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.420]   You're not asking questions like, well, is he committed?
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.380]   Does he have integrity?
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.460]   Has he surrendered to the word of God?
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.020]   Does he focus on these things?
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.220]   We don't want you asking those, OK?
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.700]   We just want to say whatever we need to say.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.980]   We might sing to you, write poetry.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.940]   We'll do crazy, stupid things just so that you're not
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.820]   thinking with your mind, so that you're
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.580]   thinking with your heart, so that you like us.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.100]   Because we want to be liked, just like you guys want
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.980]   to be liked.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.300]   The guys that are pursuing you and want your attention,
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.660]   they also want to be liked.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.500]   And so I really-- my heart tonight
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.340]   is I really want to help you.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.220]   Because it's hard for me to have the same conversation over
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.900]   and over and over, where you're here
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.180]   and you're meeting with one of my female counterparts
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.100]   up here at Watermark.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.900]   And you're crying.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.620]   Your mascara's all run down your face.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.940]   And you're saying, but everybody thought he was a good guy.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.980]   And I see it all the time.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.700]   Like, just in case I risk some of you thinking
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.660]   I'm talking about you.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.140]   I'm not.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.500]   I'm talking about hundreds of you.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.580]   But everyone thought he was a good-- everybody
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.140]   thought he was a good guy.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.740]   And I hate that.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.980]   I really do.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.580]   And so my heart is to help you find out early on,
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:38.780]   before your heart gets engaged, if he is God's man.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.260]   Because your method, it's not working.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.620]   I'm going to give you some stats.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.380]   These stats are not your fault. You
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.140]   need to know that up front.
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.860]   But I think I can help you avoid them.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.180]   Nearly half, 43% of all college women
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.300]   report having experienced either abuse or controlling behaviors
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.900]   in a dating relationship.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.460]   Nearly half.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.300]   45.4% of female rape victims were
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.540]   raped by an intimate partner.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.040]   What?
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:08.020]   That's a high number.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.860]   Intimate partner violence accounts
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.820]   for 15% of all violent crimes.
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.140]   One in four women have been victims
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.860]   of severe physical violence by an intimate partner
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.380]   in their lifetime.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.380]   I mean, that is some serious stats.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.140]   And just that you would potentially
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:35.620]   be in a relationship with a guy who might hurt you,
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.300]   that's something we have to address.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.180]   Again, it's not your fault. Not your fault at all.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.580]   But I think, as we dive into the word of God,
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.980]   I think he can help us.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.540]   And he can help you where the next guy that you
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.580]   would go on a second date with would be your forever guy,
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.540]   the one that you're going to spend forever with.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.700]   I think we can get there tonight.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.660]   So I'm going to give you a six-point checklist,
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.980]   six things to inspect.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.820]   This chapter, 1 Timothy 3, this is the chapter of what God says.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.220]   This is what I want the leader of my bride to look like.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.100]   So this is a chapter on elders.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.740]   When you hear the word elder, it doesn't mean like old person.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.700]   It means church leader, pastor, and shepherd.
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.980]   It's the same word in the Greek that's used.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.860]   When you hear the word elder, don't think like elderly.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.380]   Think wise leader of the church.
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.940]   And so this is a great list for you to look at.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.780]   We're going to boil it down to six things.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.020]   It's a lot of things, though.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.580]   It's very circular.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.420]   He repeats himself, different ideas, different words
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.660]   that mean the same thing.
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.020]   So we're going to boil it down to six things to look at.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.180]   But I'm just going to read this to you up front.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.900]   This is what God says, hey, if someone's
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.220]   going to lead my bride, which is the church,
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.740]   if you're new to the church, God calls his bride,
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.820]   Jesus's bride, the church.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.300]   If someone's going to lead my bride,
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.540]   this is the character traits that they need to have.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.340]   So listen carefully.
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.620]   Here's a trustworthy saying.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.620]   Whoever aspires to be an overseer
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.780]   desires a noble task.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.740]   Men, if you're here and you're male,
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.980]   if you're listening and you're male,
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.500]   you should desire to be an elder.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.420]   That's a noble task.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.800]   You want to meet these qualifications.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.300]   Now the overseer or the elder or the pastor
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.500]   or the shepherd is to be above reproach,
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.820]   faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled,
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.540]   respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.260]   not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle,
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.820]   not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.180]   He must manage his own family well
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.820]   and see that his children obey him.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:40.140]   And he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.380]   If anyone does not know how to manage his own family,
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.720]   how can he take care of God's church, Jesus's bride?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.600]   If he can't take care of his own bride,
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.020]   how can he take care of Jesus's bride?
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.580]   He must not be a recent convert
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.740]   or he maybe becomes conceited
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.940]   and fall under the same judgment as the devil.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.060]   He must also have a good reputation with outsiders
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.660]   so that he will not fall into disgrace
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.660]   and into the devil's trap.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.620]   So let's take that long list of things
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.180]   and let's boil it down to six things
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.940]   that you can inspect in a potential husband.
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.420]   The first one, you can inspect his commitments.
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.940]   Number one, inspect his commitments.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.420]   What's he committed to?
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.020]   What does he give his life to?
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.660]   It's okay, like if he loves his alma mater
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.100]   or he loves the Cowboys, that's fine.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.660]   That's great that he's a Cowboys fan.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.740]   If he loves the Cowboys more than he loves anything,
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.620]   that's going to be problematic, right?
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.420]   And so also, what are the commitments
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.020]   that he's made and kept?
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.060]   Is he committed to his church?
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.900]   After all, we're talking about church leadership here.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.940]   Is he under the authority of the elders?
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.060]   Like this is not mind-blowing stuff.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.580]   It's very simple things to inspect.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.100]   The bar is not that high.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.100]   Hey, I want a guy, number one,
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.500]   who is under the authority of elders.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.500]   He's a member of a local body.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.540]   That is basic 101.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.020]   That's gonna save you a lot of hurt and heartache.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.140]   Is he committed to a community group, a small group?
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.020]   Can I tell you something?
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.120]   My guys that I meet with every Friday,
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.700]   they are the biggest blessing to my wife,
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.900]   she would tell you.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.660]   Like they are a layer of protection
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.980]   between her and my flesh.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.400]   They are a safety net.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.740]   They are a number that she can call and say,
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.580]   hey, will you pray for JP in this way?
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.460]   Will you check in here?
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.740]   Hey, here's an area where we disagree.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.740]   One of the most loving things that she can do for me
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.620]   is tell on me to those guys.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.260]   She has absolute freedom.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.340]   I've told her over and over,
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.160]   hey, you reach out to those guys any time.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.820]   If you see me out of bounds or doing something foolish,
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.860]   please bring them in.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.800]   And so is he committed to community?
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.480]   Every week, every Tuesday night, we try to help you.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.060]   Hey, there's a room over here, there's a room over here.
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.460]   Guys go here, girls go here.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.060]   If you're looking for community,
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.820]   how many times have you heard that and not responded?
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.860]   Is he committed to the covenant of marriage?
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.980]   It says in verse two,
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.300]   now the overseer is to be above reproach,
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.500]   faithful to his wife.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.860]   Is he committed to the covenant of marriage?
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.060]   Like does he believe that marriage is a covenant,
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.880]   that sex is reserved for marriage,
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.460]   that it's a very important,
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.560]   it's more than a commitment to God,
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.020]   it's a covenant before God?
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.260]   I get to do weddings.
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.500]   Monica and I get to do premarital counseling.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.640]   And when you are at your wedding,
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.640]   you're gonna say some crazy things to each other.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.020]   Okay, people say, for richer or poorer,
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.080]   in sickness and in health,
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.500]   and to death do us part.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.620]   And so I ask this question,
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.940]   and it's always a little bit awkward.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.340]   I just say, hey, let me ask you a question.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.480]   Is there anything that you would leave her for?
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.380]   No, nothing, I love her, nothing.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.860]   Nothing could cause me to question my love for her.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.720]   Anything, no.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.120]   Okay, if she cheats on you repeatedly with your best friend,
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.660]   you still in on this commitment,
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.320]   this till death do us part?
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.300]   Well, she would never do that.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.680]   I know, I know.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.060]   She's a good person.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.020]   Well, here's what I believe about people.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.020]   Their heart is wicked and deceitful.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.280]   They're sinners.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.820]   We're capable of all sorts of evil.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.360]   And so as I'm gonna stand before God
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.320]   and join in this promise with you guys,
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.980]   I'm asking, what are you gonna leave her for?
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.580]   Okay, 'cause I need to know that.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.820]   I don't want you to say until death do us part,
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:40.660]   unless you mean it.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.980]   Like if you're thinking, no, no, no,
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.940]   if she cheats on me repeatedly with my best friend,
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.860]   it won't stop, like I get an out.
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.140]   Well, cool, that's great that you think that.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.100]   Let's just write that in the vows.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.220]   For richer or poorer, in sickness and health,
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.340]   until death do us part,
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.940]   unless she cheats on me repeatedly with my best friend.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.540]   Okay, I'm just gonna write that in there
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.100]   so we keep it honest, okay?
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.120]   We gotta keep it honest, right?
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.800]   Let's say what we mean and mean what we say,
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.400]   because it's a really serious commitment.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.240]   That's why I say that.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.980]   It's a really serious commitment.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.120]   And so let's not promise it unless we mean it.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.200]   People email me all the time,
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.020]   and girls will write in and they'll say,
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.560]   you know, my boyfriend cheated on me, what do I do?
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.080]   Let me answer that, okay?
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.840]   Let me answer that.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.920]   You're not gonna like my answer.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.520]   No one ever does, no one's ever responded like,
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.520]   oh, I love that answer, it's so helpful.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.280]   You break up, that's what you do.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.960]   And you say, well, where's the grace in that?
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.500]   You show grace when they're married, okay?
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.880]   You're not married, that's the good news.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.400]   Remember what dating is?
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.220]   You're assessing if they're a suitable spouse.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.200]   And if they're cheating on you, they're saying something.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.220]   They're saying, guess what, I'm not a suitable spouse.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.840]   I'm not marriage material, I like to cheat.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.440]   And maybe it was one time, I drank too much,
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.760]   we were on a break, I don't know, okay?
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.040]   But I would take that as a red flag.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.920]   Like, ladies, I don't know, man, I hate this for you.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.120]   I don't know, like you don't understand
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.640]   the princess that you are.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.600]   You don't understand, like I don't think you were ever like,
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   oh, he broke up, he cheated on me.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.560]   I just don't know what to do.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.920]   Like, man, I can tell you what to do.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.200]   Like, let him go.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.000]   Don't even date guys that might cheat on you.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.960]   Like, if that's in the realm of the possibility,
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.760]   they're not marriage material.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.680]   God is telling you something very lovingly.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.960]   And so often, the reason that you don't want to
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.020]   is because you feel guilty, because you know
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.040]   he's already been cheating on his wife with you.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.200]   What I mean, his wife is not the one he's met yet,
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.440]   but the one that he will marry.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.200]   What I mean is you guys have been physical,
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.760]   and so a lot of times, you feel stuck and trapped.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.560]   And I don't know why, ladies, you feel bad.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.000]   Like, well, he needs to experience release,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.800]   so I understand, and you like extend grace.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.980]   That's always a little odd to me.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:13.920]   Right, he can make war on your behalf,
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.220]   or he can marry you.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:19.680]   So another thing to check,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.700]   six-point checklist is his humility.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.180]   Check his humility.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.740]   It says he must not be a recent convert,
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.940]   or he may become conceited, which is the opposite of humility
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.180]   and fall under the same judgment as the devil.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.060]   Here's what that means,
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.520]   fall under the same judgment as the devil.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.920]   Lucifer, or Satan, or the devil, all the same,
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.400]   okay, he was an angel.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.300]   He was with God.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.900]   It says the most beautiful angel in the scripture.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.280]   And he was made, he's a created being,
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.940]   to reflect God's glory.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.160]   But one day, he said, hey, I don't want to worship you
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.980]   as God, I want to be like God.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.180]   And God said, hey, you think you can be like me?
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.120]   Then you go down there to that planet Earth, all right,
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.900]   and you will run this cosmic experiment.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.060]   Let's see how good of a God you are.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.140]   And so it says in the scripture,
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.560]   he's the prince of this air, he's the ruler of this world.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.100]   We kind of live in this cosmic supernatural experiment.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.780]   Are we gonna follow the ways of Satan,
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.980]   or are we gonna follow the ways of God?
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.020]   And God says, Satan was conceited.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.460]   That's why he did that.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.580]   And so you don't want to date a guy who's like Satan,
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.820]   or who is conceited.
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:26.820]   Is he a here I am guy, or is he a there you are guy?
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.940]   What I mean by that is he about himself,
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.060]   thinking about himself, or when he engages
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.220]   with your family and your friends,
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.860]   is he like, oh, tell me about it, so where are you from?
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.220]   Oh, that's so interesting.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:42.740]   Like, whoever drives that, they're a here I am guy, okay?
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.620]   Now, before you judge me, it's for sale, all right?
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.220]   So if one of you are a here I am guy, I got you, all right?
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.620]   And so, right, you don't want a here I am guy.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.340]   You want a, oh, there you are guy.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.400]   Let me turn my attention to you,
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.820]   and not just you because he's dating.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.380]   I mean, he's interviewing for the job.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.660]   But how he treats other people, you can look at that,
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.340]   and you can see his humility.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.060]   It says not quarrelsome.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.060]   You know, quarrels come from pride, that's verse three.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.120]   Gentleness comes from humility.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.020]   Ladies, I don't,
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:21.100]   I don't understand, ladies.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.320]   Why are you attracted to arrogant jerks?
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.420]   Amen.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.740]   Why, though?
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.560]   I don't understand.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.460]   Like, man, I just remember, like, that dude
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.260]   I went to high school with, like, just because
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.160]   he could throw a football, you know, 100 yards,
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.340]   and he'd walk through the hallway with his chest out,
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.420]   and he drove that obnoxious red car.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.500]   He always dated the head cheerleader.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.780]   So cocky.
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.700]   But he always had a girlfriend, the sweet girlfriend,
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.660]   the nice girl that he was always messing around.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.700]   I don't understand.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.980]   I know, ladies, that you like confidence.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.720]   Please don't mistake conceit for confidence.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.420]   Being conceited is like counterfeit confidence.
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.820]   Confidence is like rooted in the Holy Spirit,
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.180]   trusting in God, believing that God's in control.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:14.320]   Conceited is rooted in your own abilities.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.080]   Thinking that you're all that, that dude will hurt you.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.500]   And so I think humility is one of the most important
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.760]   qualities to look for in a man.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.200]   Is he teachable?
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.360]   Does he have someone else pouring into him?
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:30.080]   The third thing to inspect is his reputation.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:30.920]   That's a big one.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.400]   Inspect his reputation.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.600]   It says in verse seven, he must also have a good reputation.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.000]   And so what do other people think about him?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.860]   I think this is the one that you're quick to blow off
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.440]   when your heart has already moved that direction.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.440]   I've seen this before.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.600]   Like your family and your friends are saying,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.520]   "Hey, he's not a good guy, he's not a good guy."
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.720]   But here's what you say, ladies, 'cause I've heard it.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.920]   But I really know him.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.400]   Y'all don't know him like I know him.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.800]   All of you people who've been in his life,
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.560]   his entire life, and some of you,
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.760]   even his sister who was raised with him in the same,
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.480]   y'all don't know him like I know him.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.640]   He's like a dog.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.140]   He's mean to other people, but he's nice to me.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.180]   What does that mean, what does that mean?
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:28.580]   He has a good reputation with outsiders.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.660]   Is he respected?
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.220]   Your children are gonna have to respect him.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.500]   Because he's not just interviewing
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.940]   for the position of husband,
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.060]   he's also interviewing for the position of a dad,
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.660]   of a father.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.700]   And so it says he must manage his own family well
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.860]   and see that his children obey him,
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.820]   and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect.
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:49.820]   And so will he be a good dad?
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.520]   Does he love kids, right?
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.700]   Does he enjoy kids?
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.540]   That's important.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.000]   Or is he gonna be like, "Hey, we can get married,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.500]   "and for 10 years we'll travel,
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.260]   "and then maybe one day we'll have kids."
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.100]   I know your expectations align there.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.980]   I told you I buy and sell things.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.540]   One time I bought a stolen car.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.340]   I didn't know it was stolen.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.820]   I mean, the dude had the title and everything.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.160]   I know I should give up on this hobby,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.500]   I know what you're thinking.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.000]   Dude had a title and everything.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.140]   I met him here at a church.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.940]   Like we drove around town, we went to the bank together.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.980]   Like I was sharing the gospel,
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.540]   we were talking about Jesus, this guy.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.500]   He showed me a fake ID, he had the title in his hand,
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.500]   he sold me the car, I gave him cash, right?
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.540]   I'm a fool, I know.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.080]   And then DPS shows up, and they like take the car from me.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.360]   They're like, "Oh, this car is stolen,
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.000]   "you can't have it, it's ours now."
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.240]   I'm like, "Oh man, this isn't good."
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.280]   And so now, right now what I do is I check Carfax,
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.280]   because it shows me the vehicle's history.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.560]   It shows me its reputation, right?
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.300]   Ladies, check references.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.920]   Check references.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.400]   Like talk to people who know him.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.840]   Hopefully you're dating in the church,
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.680]   and he's in community, and other people know him.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.040]   I mean, interview his ex-girlfriend
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.800]   if you wanna know how he really is.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.840]   Like it's funny that people are like,
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.200]   "That's crazy, I would never do that."
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.640]   I would do that if I were you, you know?
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.600]   Now here's what happened is guys just lost a little hope,
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.720]   and they're like, "Oh man, but I really messed up.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.600]   "You know, I really messed up."
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.040]   No, no, here's the deal, there is grace though.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.880]   There is grace.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.920]   Like let me go back to my car analogy.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.680]   For my wife, I bought this car that had a salvage title.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.520]   Here's what that means.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.680]   It had been in a really, really bad accident.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.880]   Like really bad accident.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.960]   Like they thought, the insurance company thought
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.840]   it couldn't be repaired.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.920]   But then somebody repaired it.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.460]   And that keeps a lot of people away.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.040]   Like nobody wants the car that's been in a bad accident.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.000]   Except for, here's what I did.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.560]   When I pulled Carfax, I saw that it had been
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.420]   three and a half years since that accident,
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.200]   and it ran perfect.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.240]   And that told me something.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.480]   That told me that it was fixed.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.800]   That it had been fixed well.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.740]   And so guys, just because he served time,
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.700]   doesn't mean he won't be a good husband.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.880]   I mean that.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.120]   Like just because he's made some really tragic mistakes,
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.960]   doesn't mean he won't be a good husband.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.880]   But you want to see a track record of faithfulness.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.080]   You want to see a history of faithfulness,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.960]   a season of faithfulness.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.000]   Six months probably isn't long enough.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.480]   Like if you like him in six months,
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.960]   and you see six months ago,
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.000]   there was a huge wreck in his life.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.480]   Some addiction, something terrible.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   You say, hey, I'm interested in you,
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.640]   but I'd love to see a little bit longer
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.080]   track record of faithfulness.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.480]   Let's give this some time.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.520]   Time is our friend.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:48.560]   It's interesting that that guy that sold me that stolen car,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.740]   he tricked me.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.700]   He was playing a game.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.480]   I mean he showed me a fake ID.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.320]   He said all of the right things.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.240]   I fell victim to his charm.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.240]   Which the Bible says is deceitful.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.560]   Right?
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.920]   Proverbs 31, 30, charm is deceitful.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.560]   And so ladies, if he's interviewing for the job,
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.820]   like he may be saying crazy stuff to you.
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.320]   Singing songs to you, and writing poems to you,
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.480]   and drawing you pictures, sending you text messages.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.720]   But he may be selling you a stolen car.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.060]   So check his references.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.040]   The fourth thing I would inspect
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.540]   is his initiative.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.040]   His initiative.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.800]   Does he have some drive?
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.240]   Is he passionate about life?
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.040]   Does he have some passion in him?
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.680]   Like when the going gets hard, is he going to get going?
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.500]   Right?
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.720]   Get off the couch and make some things happen.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.560]   Right?
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.140]   This verse is about leadership.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.400]   That's what this verse is about.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.600]   He must manage his family well.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.320]   To manage his family well, it's going to take some drive.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.480]   And so girls ask me all the time,
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.360]   well hey, can a girl ask a guy out?
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.240]   Is it okay?
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.840]   Can girls ask guys out?
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.160]   I mean, I guess.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.120]   Like I don't think it'll keep you out of heaven or anything.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.020]   What do you mean, can you?
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.080]   I don't know.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.360]   Can you?
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.480]   I mean, do I think it's God's best?
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.060]   No, I don't think it's God's best.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.900]   Right?
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.720]   Why?
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   Why don't I think it's God's best?
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.240]   Because he's failing the first test.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.040]   Initiative.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.780]   Like what better test to display initiative
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.780]   is for him to risk a yes or a no by asking you a question.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.140]   Now we talked a couple weeks ago
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.500]   about how scary that is for us guys.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.300]   It's terrifying, ladies, to go up to you
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.040]   and to look you in the eyes and to use our words
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.300]   and to say, well, will you go out with me?
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.060]   You know, I'd like to go on a date with you.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.540]   That's a terrifying thing, 'cause ladies, you are scary.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.700]   Like you got earrings and fingernails and stuff.
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.700]   It's terrifying.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.400]   It's really scary.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.980]   I'm serious.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.620]   I'm serious, right?
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.920]   But when a guy does that,
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.260]   you know, man, this guy, like he likes me enough
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:15.980]   to be vulnerable enough to do something that's hard.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:16.880]   Hey guys, listen.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   Listen to me.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.740]   Men, you gotta do hard things
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:27.220]   for the rest of your life, okay?
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.060]   For the rest of your life,
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.200]   you're gonna have to do some really hard things.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.440]   And so it is hard to ask her out.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.720]   I completely empathize with that.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.820]   But do it.
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:45.920]   People, you know, men will ask,
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.020]   well, what does it mean to lead in dating?
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.680]   Having initiative, taking initiative,
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.700]   planning, communicating clearly.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.040]   This is what it means to lead in dating,
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.120]   leading in purity.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.800]   Guys, I've said this over and over for years now,
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.360]   and I wanna help you, men.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.720]   Girls wonder, all right?
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.200]   They wonder about everything.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.120]   They wonder if you're gonna text them or call them,
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.560]   if there's going to be a date number two,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.960]   and they wonder where you're gonna take them,
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.000]   and they wonder if you like them
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.960]   and what you think about them,
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.280]   and they wonder if you like their perfume
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.400]   or if you like their shirt.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.760]   They wonder if you're on a date or if you're just friends
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.740]   and it's a friend-ation ship, like where is it going?
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.680]   They wonder about these things.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.160]   And then let me tell you something, leaders,
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.720]   you can write this down, tweet it out,
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.800]   share it with the world, leaders remove confusion.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.040]   If you wanna know what it means to lead in dating,
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.680]   you can clap, you can clap for that.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.560]   Ladies, guys, they're clapping
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.560]   because you're not doing this.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.860]   Leaders remove confusion, all right?
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.240]   So anticipate the confusion and remove it with your words.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.720]   Address it, be intentional.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.440]   Say, hey, this is where this is going.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.780]   And ladies, he doesn't need to be rich.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.620]   You need to know that.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.800]   They're like, oh, he, you know, he gotta be rich.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.440]   He doesn't need to be rich.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.800]   He needs to take initiative,
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.940]   to be able to look for a job, you know,
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:17.080]   to be gainfully employed, to honor Christ and how he works.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.660]   Let me tell you more about this on this one.
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.920]   Number five, you can inspect his self-control.
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.260]   Number five, inspect his self-control.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.780]   It says in verse three, not given to drunkenness,
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.400]   not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome,
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.580]   not a lover of money.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.660]   It's interesting that some of the ladies are like,
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.220]   I want someone who has a lot of money.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.540]   People who have a lot of money tend to love money.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.000]   So be careful with that because it says
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.080]   you don't want someone who loves money, all right?
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.800]   So it's not about him having a lot of money.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.100]   It's about him being able to work hard to provide for you.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.620]   That's a part of it, right?
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.940]   And so let's just talk about what this verse says
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.780]   to inspect.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.780]   It says a few things here.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.940]   I'm gonna give you three A's after the not loving money.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.700]   It says, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.380]   and not quarrelsome.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:12.340]   And so it's not, so you can inspect alcohol,
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:17.020]   anger and adultery under self-control.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.740]   Alcohol, anger and adultery.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.380]   Alcohol, are they sober-minded, right?
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.100]   If you go on that first date and he throws back
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.660]   three Mambo taxis, right?
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.860]   This is a red flag.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.060]   This ain't your dude, man.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.060]   Like move on.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.540]   Like this is not your guy.
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.340]   If you've seen him drunk, like y'all have been on,
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.740]   you've seen him intoxicated, here's what he's saying.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.020]   I'm not scared of you, God.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.220]   I know your word says don't get drunk,
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.140]   but I'm gonna do what I want, okay?
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.140]   And ladies, like some of you, you don't care
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.100]   if he gets drunk because you get drunk and you know it.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.540]   And man, just, hey, I would just reconsider.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:59.820]   I reconsider, all right?
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.780]   There's a God, he loves you.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.660]   He's given you some instructions, not to rip you off
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.960]   but to set you free, all right?
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.820]   Is he angry?
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.520]   It says gentle, not violent, not quarrelsome.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.180]   Is he given a rage when things don't go his way?
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.020]   This is a big red flag.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.300]   If he's yelling at you, he's throwing stuff.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.060]   If he puts his hands on you, you run,
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.060]   you delete the number, you block it,
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.560]   restraining order, like never again.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.640]   Like there's no second chance on that in dating.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.860]   No second chance in dating, all right?
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.380]   That's a single issue disqualifier,
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.660]   like we talked about in voting last week,
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.620]   the real truth real quick.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:46.980]   That's a single issue disqualifier, all right?
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.580]   We, there was a girl and a guy,
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.540]   we were about to get married,
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.500]   and right before the wedding, we had heard some things
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.180]   that he had an abusive history.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.100]   And so I mean right before the wedding,
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.660]   like days before, we reached out to her,
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.580]   said hey, like did you know this?
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.980]   She was like hey, I didn't know that
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.540]   but I don't even know if it's true.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.860]   I think I know the real him.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.540]   And we're like hey, we really think
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.580]   that you should delay this wedding,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.900]   at least to do a little bit more research here.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.540]   So angry, like gave the church the double bird,
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.420]   hey, I don't wanna talk to you guys anymore,
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.700]   like get out of our business, you don't understand,
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.240]   you're just not for us, you know?
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.860]   They go somewhere else, they get married.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.100]   They go on the honeymoon.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.000]   They come back, he throws her down a flight of stairs,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.200]   breaks both of her legs.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.800]   And we're there to pick up the pieces.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.960]   It's not I told you so time, it's not what this is about.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.960]   It's about hey, as you check that reputation,
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.800]   you wanna make sure that he doesn't give full vent
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.900]   to his anger because that's not God's man.
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.500]   That dude's gonna discipline your children, all right?
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:09.600]   Be wise in the way that you think about that.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.840]   It says he's temperate, verse two,
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.720]   that he's marked by self-restraint and discipline, right?
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.540]   Like not laziness and drunkenness or indulging his flesh.
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.900]   This is the last A is adultery.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.240]   I get this email all the time.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.740]   Hey, my boyfriend's looking at porn, what do I do?
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.240]   Like let me tell you how I interpret that
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.400]   as a former porn addict.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.320]   If we don't know each other,
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.280]   there's not a lot of judgment here.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.920]   I've looked at more porn than any of you.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.700]   That's the truth, all right?
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.220]   That's who's talking to you right now.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.280]   But I found freedom and sobriety
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   from that struggle by God's grace.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.760]   And so when you say, hey, my boyfriend's looking at porn,
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.380]   what do I do, here's what I read.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.840]   My boyfriend's cheating on me repeatedly, what do I do?
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.640]   And my answer is the same.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.840]   You break up and you let him get well.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.420]   You let him get well.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.820]   And I know you hate that answer.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.980]   You're like no, it's gotta be something,
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.600]   there's no grace in that.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.000]   Yes, you let him get well.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.120]   That's what grace is.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.120]   Let him heal.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.380]   Say, hey, I want you to go through a recovery program
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.000]   because this is messing you up.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.400]   You're not just cheating on me sexually.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.620]   An addiction to porn is not an addiction to sex.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:24.400]   An addiction to porn is an addiction to variety.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.620]   That man will never be satisfied
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.060]   in a monogamous relationship.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.400]   It will never happen.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.780]   He's programmed his brain for a variety type of girls
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.760]   all the time, hundreds and hundreds of images.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.200]   I know it is incredibly hurtful
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.080]   and I know it is incredibly difficult
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.760]   'cause you think, man, if I let him go,
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.560]   will somebody else come around?
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.840]   That's where you get to trust God.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.240]   That's what faith is.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.760]   All right, as my friend has said it very well up here,
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.240]   you do not lower your standards,
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.520]   you lengthen your patience.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.800]   You do not lower your standards,
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.880]   you lengthen your patience.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.100]   Well, how long, how long do I gotta be patient?
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.400]   I don't know.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.600]   That's the truth.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.200]   I have no idea.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.240]   But I know you're better off single
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.680]   than married to a porn addict.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.240]   I believe that.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.480]   Now, of course, if you're married
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.320]   or you're in that relationship,
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.560]   my instruction looks different
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.360]   'cause now two have become one flesh
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.640]   and the recovery looks different,
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.200]   but he still needs to get well.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.240]   It blows my mind.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.160]   Jennifer Lawrence said this
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.600]   about when some naked pictures
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.520]   that she had texted her boyfriends leaked.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.760]   She said, "I was in a loving, healthy,
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.760]   "great relationship for four years.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.080]   "It was long distance,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.120]   "and either your boyfriend is going to look at porn
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.960]   "or he's going to look at you."
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:48.080]   And I think Jennifer needs Christ first.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.920]   I think she needs to come to the porch.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.600]   And girls, can I just say this real quick,
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.320]   public service announcement, all right?
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.440]   Like, we just got real talk real quick.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.840]   And guys, for you too, I mean,
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.600]   this might serve you really well
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.200]   if you leave with nothing else but Jesus in this.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.280]   It'll be helpful.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.800]   The internet is not safe.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.320]   All right, I know you thought that,
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.760]   that connection between your cell phone
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.360]   and his cell phone was so secure.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.320]   And I know he promised you
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.880]   he wasn't gonna show those pictures to anyone,
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.840]   but people do weird things when they get hurt.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.760]   And a lot of times in relationships, they get hurt.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.440]   And so if you send him any pictures of you,
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.880]   you just assume the whole world is gonna see that.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.200]   Don't do it.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.040]   Don't do it.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:37.640]   I would tell Jennifer that there's a lot of guys
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.080]   that aren't looking at porn or touching their girlfriends
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.360]   or touching themselves for that matter.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.720]   I remember when I came to Watermark,
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.000]   like, for the first time, like, straight out of the world,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.600]   right, straight out of uptown,
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.320]   and I get plugged into this small group,
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.040]   and they're going around, like, prayer requests,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.640]   and one guy's like, "Hey, I got something to celebrate."
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.480]   And I'm like, "What?"
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.640]   You know, we're like, "What, what is it?"
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.680]   And he goes, "I haven't masturbated in three years."
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.360]   And I was like, "Dude, and you're still alive?"
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.000]   Like, is that even possible?
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.400]   I didn't even know that was possible.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.040]   And like, and just in case you didn't laugh just then,
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.440]   because you're like, "You're still alive?"
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.160]   It is possible.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.840]   You can wage war like that.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.200]   Like, you don't have to just embrace sexual immorality
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.400]   because it's the norm around you.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.920]   Like, you literally can wage war here, all right?
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.520]   Let me tell you what the Scripture says.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:37.040]   1 Thessalonians chapter four, it says that,
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.240]   "Each of you should learn to control your own body
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.960]   "in a way that is holy and honorable,
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.920]   "not in passionate lust like the pagans
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.520]   "who do not know God, and that in this matter,
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.080]   "no one should wrong or take advantage
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.160]   "of a brother or sister."
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.400]   And then this is a terrifying verse.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.600]   This is a great Halloween verse right here.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.240]   It really is scary, because it says,
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.040]   "The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins."
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.440]   As we told you and warned you before.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.440]   Another version says,
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.600]   "The Lord is the avenger of such things."
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.400]   And so, ladies, one way to know if he is self-controlled,
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.800]   it's that he's not trying to put his hand up your shirt
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.600]   or down your pants, okay?
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.600]   He's restraining his fleshly desire
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.960]   because he honors the marriage covenant.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.120]   That guy is leading you ladies very, very well.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.100]   So please don't be like,
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.680]   "Oh, he must not be attracted to me
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.320]   "because he's not very physical."
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.720]   No, he's waging war.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.400]   He's in a battle, okay?
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.480]   Like respect that as much as you can.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.680]   Like honor that, say, "Thank you
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.360]   "for the way that you respect my body
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.360]   "and the way that you are waging war to make it to marriage."
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.880]   That's a beautiful thing.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.880]   The last thing that you inspect is his truth.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.580]   What does he see as truth?
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.300]   It says, "They must keep hold of the deep truths
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.380]   "of the faith with a clear conscience."
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.460]   That's verse nine.
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.280]   It says in verse two,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.560]   "Now the overseer is to be above reproach
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.620]   "and able to teach."
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.460]   Able to teach what?
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.000]   To teach the Bible that he's been poured into,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.420]   that he has the word of God written on his heart.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.580]   Hey, it's been, well, we're talking about cars
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.060]   and it's been said about guys,
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.780]   like one of the reputations men have
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.500]   is that we don't like to ask for directions, okay?
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.260]   What I would tell you is don't date a guy
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.540]   that's not constantly asking him for direction.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.720]   Where should I go?
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.740]   What should I do?
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.100]   How should I think?
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.540]   How should I treat her?
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.740]   Where should I look?
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.420]   What am I committed to?
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:42.220]   But he's constantly asking for direction.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.620]   And so I would ask you, what determines his truth?
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.080]   Is it convenience?
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.320]   Has he built his life on the word of God?
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.860]   Is that his firm foundation?
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.940]   Does he demonstrate to the world integrity,
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.780]   that he surrendered to the Holy Spirit,
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.140]   that he's trustworthy?
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.340]   Does he do the right thing?
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.380]   Like this is so simple.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:07.060]   Sometimes I really think that if you've trusted in Christ,
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.780]   like and as you pursue and worship him,
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:13.780]   life can be as simple as do the right thing.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.100]   Faced with a choice, there's this and there's this,
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.180]   just do the right thing.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.360]   It says about David, that he was a man
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.080]   after God's own heart.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.440]   And in Acts 13, I think it's verse 22,
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.120]   God clarifies, here's what I meant when I said
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.320]   David was a man after my heart.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   He did everything I asked him to do.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.600]   He was fully surrendered to my word.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.840]   That's what it looks like to be a man after God's heart.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.800]   You do everything God asks you to do.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.720]   Let me tell you something, there's this guy
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.960]   that I've been in community with for 14 years.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.260]   14 years we ran together, he and I are very different,
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.220]   couldn't be more different.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.660]   Like we think with two different sides of the brain.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:58.140]   And I will tell you, I told him the other day,
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.460]   I said, hey, I want you to know something.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:05.620]   I trust you more than I trust any other single human being
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:06.660]   other than my wife.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.780]   And the reason is, is because I've seen this brother
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.700]   make really hard decisions, he does the right thing
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.820]   even when it's not his decision.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.600]   He does the right thing even when it's hard.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.800]   He has the conversations, he doesn't gossip,
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.320]   he follows the law, even when it's hard,
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.160]   even when he wouldn't get caught,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.040]   he just does the right thing.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.840]   And I asked him if I could share that.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.400]   And so his wife called me this morning,
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.680]   she says, hey, before you tell thousands of people
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.280]   that about my husband, you tell them,
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.780]   hey, that's why I married him.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.760]   Because I saw that in his life.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.800]   I saw that no matter how difficult it was,
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.440]   that he did the right thing.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.660]   And so you need someone who holds onto truth
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.720]   and he lives by it.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:57.400]   Girls, I don't know, I get confused why you like bad boys.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.520]   Let me ask you, let me just ask you girls,
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.960]   ladies, I'm asking.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.160]   Do y'all like bad boys, like bad guys?
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.000]   Y'all like them?
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.960]   Yeah, Harley Davidson.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:13.580]   Like, I'm gonna use that, I'll go off that, okay?
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.860]   I mean, true story, like,
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:21.240]   I'm driving this thing yesterday.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.280]   I'm about to pull out on the road.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.480]   Two girls whip around, like in the parking lot,
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.320]   pull around, pull up beside me, roll down their window.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.600]   They say, hey baby, can we get a ride?
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.760]   Now let me tell you something,
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.260]   I'm a middle-aged man with three kids.
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.960]   Like, I understand that they are not attracted to me.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.960]   You know?
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.380]   But if you can put off a bad boy persona,
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.000]   it seems like you guys are attracted to that.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.760]   And God doesn't say be attracted to Harley Davidsons.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:52.560]   All right?
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.800]   He gives you other things to be attracted to.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.620]   He says, hey, I want you to look at this list.
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.200]   This is what I want you to follow.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.960]   This is what you're after.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.880]   So let me ask you again, ladies, do you like bad guys?
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.180]   It seems to me like you do.
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.680]   Now, let me show you.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.840]   Do you know who this is right here?
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.000]   Y'all know who that is?
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.880]   That's Nicholas Cruz.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.820]   All right, he walked into a school in Parkland, Florida
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.680]   and killed 17 people, he shot 'em dead.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.320]   He goes into jail, he goes to jail,
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.840]   he's waiting to be tried,
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.220]   and he starts getting an influx of love letters.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.840]   I'll read to you, this is what they say.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.760]   Longtime Bowery County public defender, Howard,
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.000]   said he's never seen a defendant get so many letters,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.680]   not even close, hundreds of letters sent to him
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.840]   of those made public by the Bowery County Sheriff's Office.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.520]   There wasn't one letter that criticized the confessed killer.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.240]   No, they asked if he could have,
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.680]   or if they could have his baby.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.520]   They sent him seductive pictures of themselves.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.760]   Who were the letters from?
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.500]   Girls.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:07.900]   Hey, I know you killed 17 people,
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.720]   but I find you attractive, attractive.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.040]   And you're right, it's dysfunctional.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.960]   You're right, here's what every lady thinks,
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.160]   like yeah, but not, like that's crazy
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.560]   that he would get a lot of, that's crazy.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.920]   But consider this, ladies.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.680]   How many times have you been in a relationship
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.720]   with a guy that you knew was gonna hurt you?
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.680]   How many times have you dated someone
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.580]   when you knew he was not good for you?
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:36.140]   How many times have you gone back
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:39.580]   to someone who broke your heart and hurt you?
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:43.720]   As you go, I would never do that with that guy.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.440]   And yet we practice it in these small microcosms.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:50.040]   We think yeah, there is a part of me.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.160]   I think Satan delights in the reality
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:59.600]   that you find something rebellious, attractive.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.480]   And what it's doing is you're like,
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.160]   well, there's no guys, there's no good guys out there.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.880]   No, I'm telling you, I'm looking out here
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.980]   and there are some good guys in the room.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.560]   There are some good guys in the room
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.640]   that are doing the right things,
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.940]   that are following God, that are seeking to surrender to God.
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:23.240]   I just wanna end by saying you're a princess.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.940]   You're a daughter to the king.
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:30.600]   And it seems like, and ladies,
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.760]   I don't mean to be hard on you.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.660]   I really, my heart is to help you.
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:38.100]   But in that competitive spirit,
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:42.140]   it seems that you're attracted to guys in relationships.
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.780]   That's always confused me too.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:48.700]   Like before I was in a relationship with Christ,
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.860]   I can remember being out in the scene
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:55.620]   and talking with a girl and it going places
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:56.980]   where it goes in the world.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.500]   And me just saying, hey, I have a girlfriend.
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.460]   And her just saying, hey, I don't care.
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:07.240]   And so we would use each other and we would have fun.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:11.360]   And so I'm gonna end really controversial.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.220]   I'm gonna end by saying something really crazy.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:20.180]   Ladies, you might look for a guy who's in a relationship.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.700]   Like, well, just think about it
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.860]   'cause you can observe these things, right?
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.420]   If he's in a relationship,
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:28.600]   you can look at his commitments.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.380]   In summary, if he's in a relationship,
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.880]   you can look at his humility.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.860]   If he's in a relationship,
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.200]   you can kind of see his reputation.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.940]   If he's in a relationship, you can see if he initiates,
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.020]   if he takes initiative.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.240]   If he's in a relationship,
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.060]   you can see if he's self-controlled.
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.500]   If he's in a relationship,
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.080]   you can see what truth he surrendered to.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:57.980]   And so I want you to find a guy who is in a relationship
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:59.900]   and no, I'm not talking about a relationship
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:00.720]   with another girl.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.920]   I'm talking about a relationship with Christ.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:09.200]   (congregation applauding)
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.540]   That he would be surrendered to Jesus.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:18.020]   It's interesting when that guy brought this thing over.
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.500]   He drove it over to my house.
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.340]   It's like, man, I don't know,
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.740]   I'm gonna drive it with the check engine light on.
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:26.940]   He brings it over and my kids are going crazy.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.140]   They're like, "Daddy, what?
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:29.980]   "Can we keep it?"
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:30.820]   I'm like, "No."
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:34.220]   And they love it.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.060]   And I should've known at this point the deal was done.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:36.980]   I should've known.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.180]   He goes, "Yeah, for me, I just think of it like a jet ski."
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:42.140]   And I said, "What do you mean?"
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.880]   He goes, "Well, it's kind of fun for the weekend,
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.180]   "but then you're over it."
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:48.420]   I thought about that.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.420]   I was like, "Yeah."
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:52.900]   That's kind of how it works when you make a decision
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.960]   based on how something is on the outside.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.880]   Right, it's not very functional.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:03.900]   You can't take passengers or carry cargo or do anything.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.140]   It's not a very functional.
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.820]   In fact, there's only one reason you would buy that car,
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.580]   because you're looking for a good time.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.740]   You're looking for a fun experience.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:17.380]   Ladies, some of you,
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:20.060]   some of you aren't looking for a husband.
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.100]   You're looking for an adventure.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.740]   And I would really challenge you on that,
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.780]   to seek out a husband.
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.060]   In fact, as I was thinking about that,
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.300]   I thought about my truck.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.500]   My truck is 13 years old.
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.700]   It's got 100,000 miles on it.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.700]   It's been faithful to me.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.140]   When I turn the key, it starts.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.260]   It's the base model.
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:44.060]   It didn't have power locks or power windows or power seats.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.060]   It didn't have anything.
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.860]   You know what's sexy about my truck?
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.580]   Nothing.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:52.140]   You get inside, it kind of stinks a little bit.
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.140]   It smells like a boy's lived in it for 13 years.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.260]   Right?
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.180]   But it's never been in the shop.
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.180]   It just works.
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.140]   It just runs.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.540]   And so ladies, what if instead of sexy,
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.940]   you looked for surrender to Christ?
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:15.140]   Instead of sexy, you held out for surrender to Christ.
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:19.540]   Because is Christ not the perfect example of this?
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.860]   Like Christ was committed.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.860]   The scripture says about him that he was humble.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:29.860]   His reputation, we still read about it 2,000 years later
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.020]   that he saved those who trusted in him.
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.100]   He took initiative.
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:35.020]   He went first.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.940]   He says, "For the joy set before him,
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.820]   "he died for your sins."
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:42.660]   He was controlled by the Holy Spirit.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.060]   He said he was tempted in every way, but never sinned.
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:46.460]   He was self-controlled.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:51.460]   And he was the truth, the word of God in the flesh.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:54.060]   That is who we follow.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.260]   And so ladies, you're looking for someone who follows him,
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.660]   someone who is in a committed relationship with him.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.980]   If you have that, those other things, they'll follow suit.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.540]   This is the gold standard.
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:07.700]   All of those things, they may ebb and flow.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:08.900]   It may be in different degrees,
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:11.020]   but if he's fully surrendered to Christ,
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:14.660]   he's gonna be a great husband.
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.780]   He's gonna be a great father.
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:18.060]   Let me pray you find that.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:26.140]   Father, we thank you for the example of your son, Jesus.
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:30.300]   We thank you for what you did for us through him.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:40.980]   Father, I pray for my female friends in the room.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:46.460]   God, they're scared.
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:48.220]   They don't wanna be single forever.
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:51.860]   Lord, it's easy, the enemy tempts us to think
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.420]   that you've forgotten about us,
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.660]   that you don't have a plan for us.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:00.620]   Father, would you remind them that you love them
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.220]   and you do have a plan for them?
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:05.940]   That first and foremost,
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.220]   you desire for them to be married to you.
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:13.540]   And then Lord, I pray out of this group
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:17.660]   that you would raise up men, real men,
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.420]   confident in your Holy Spirit,
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.700]   surrendered to your Holy Spirit,
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:24.140]   who would engage women that are surrendered
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.620]   to your Holy Spirit,
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.500]   and that they would get married and have children.
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.780]   Your kingdom would be advanced through that.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:35.740]   Father, would you change, would you tune our hearts
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.180]   in the list that we're looking for?
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.220]   You know, whether she's tall or blonde or brunette
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:45.220]   or whether he's a doctor or lawyer or, you know, built,
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.100]   that we would tune it to.
[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:47.820]   Are they surrendered to Christ?
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.860]   Would you make that enough for us, please?
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:55.580]   Even as we worship you now, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:55:05.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
