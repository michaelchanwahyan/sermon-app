[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.860]   All right, well, hey, welcome friends in the room
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.480]   to Porch Kickoff 2021.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.320]   And friends,
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.600]   man, this is my 12th kickoff to be a part of,
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.480]   and this one feels as sweet.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.600]   You guys look good, man.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.200]   Maybe it's just 'cause I haven't seen people in a while,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.880]   but it is so fun to get to be with y'all.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.760]   And everybody joining us online
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.600]   or everyone at different locations,
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.720]   one time a year, we try to rattle off
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.540]   all the different locations just to celebrate
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.200]   how God has worked all around the country
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.080]   at Porch Live locations outside of this city.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.680]   And so we've got Austin, Texas, I wanna welcome,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.940]   Cincinnati, Houston, Northwest Arkansas,
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.880]   South Hampton, Philadelphia, Tulsa, Boise, Idaho,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.760]   Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Southwest Minnesota,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760]   Indianapolis, Scottsdale, and Fort Worth.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.480]   And Scottsdale and Indianapolis kicking off tonight,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.880]   Porch locations around the country.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.840]   Hey, let me kick us off and give you a little bit
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.000]   of a glimpse into my time over the break
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.520]   that'll give us some traction for where we're going.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640]   I have a son who turned five, his name is Crew.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.320]   I think we have a picture of him up here.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.120]   There he is, first day of school,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.160]   just dimples, cute as can be.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.400]   And it was back in October, September,
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.440]   whenever school started,
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.560]   but he enrolled in a basketball clinic.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.440]   What's a basketball clinic?
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.260]   It's where they go,
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.520]   you don't get on a team,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.360]   you just learn how to play basketball 'cause you're five.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.420]   So we showed up, we went to the basketball clinic,
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.260]   I think we have a picture there of him standing,
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.240]   there he is on the right,
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.080]   just standing there with a basketball.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.360]   He's never played basketball before,
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.200]   doesn't really totally get it, but that's okay.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.040]   It's a clinic.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.360]   The whole point is you show up and they teach you
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.960]   how to play basketball, how to dribble the ball,
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.880]   how to handle things.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.840]   The coach is standing in that picture,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.800]   has everybody line up, go back to the first picture,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.840]   has everyone line up, says,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.920]   hey, first thing we're gonna do,
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.420]   we're gonna work on dribbling.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.280]   My son has like the greatest fear of failure
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.320]   of anyone that I know.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.280]   He gets it from his mom, that's definitely not true,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.800]   but he immediately picks up the ball
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.960]   and the coach is like, hey, we're gonna dribble,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.640]   we're just gonna walk down the court, we're gonna dribble.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.840]   And I just see, and whenever you're five,
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.280]   the tear ducts are like in full display at all times.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.680]   So there's tears on call whenever you need them.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.520]   And I just see him from across the way
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.360]   and he begins to like just,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.720]   like a trembling lip and just freak out
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.880]   and the coach says go
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.920]   and all the other kids start dribbling down.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.340]   He picks up his ball and just runs over immediately to me,
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.220]   bawling, saying, I can't do it, I can't do it.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.140]   And I'm like, this mixture of like emotions
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.500]   and come on, son, you're embarrassing me here
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.340]   and what am I doing?
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.160]   You're five.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.420]   And I walk over and I get him and I take him back over
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.540]   and I'm like, hey, it's okay, you're gonna learn.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.380]   This is why we're here.
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.200]   You're just gonna learn how to dribble.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.040]   It's gonna be okay.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.940]   He's still bawling.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.300]   He doesn't wanna do the dribbling drills.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.140]   That's okay.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.020]   Next drill comes up.
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.060]   It's a passing game.
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.260]   Kids get in a circle.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.260]   I think we had a picture of that.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.380]   All the kids get in a circle
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.700]   and he bounce, or the coach passes it.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.080]   The first kid to miss it or fumble has to sit down
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.840]   and they go around until there's one person left standing.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.640]   The way you win is you catch it every single time.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.800]   So they'll go around, I'm watching him.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.640]   I'm seeing him catch it.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.720]   I'm like, there you go, slugger.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.560]   And eventually all the kids end up dropping it
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.440]   except for him.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.440]   I'm like, dude, this is great.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.040]   He's gonna love basketball.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.160]   This is just great memories that he's forming.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.600]   I look over and the coach says, everybody stand back up.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.800]   Let's play again.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.880]   Again, the tear ducts just like explode
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.080]   and he picks up his ball and runs back over to me
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.280]   and the coach is like, he doesn't wanna play.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.520]   He's like, yeah, I wanna go out on top.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.360]   I won.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.180]   I don't wanna risk losing it again.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.620]   I'm like, oh my goodness.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.300]   This fear of failing or not succeeding,
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.940]   you're gonna have to get over.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.140]   It's really one of the more interesting ways
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.140]   that I've seen that fear of people down
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.620]   or fear of failing take place in his life.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.820]   It's a fear that he's gonna battle for the rest of his life.
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.180]   You see, I was joking earlier saying he gets from mom.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.500]   If anything, he gets it from his dad
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.620]   and I'll explain more what I mean in a second.
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.620]   But all of that idea is, is I'm afraid to fail.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.240]   I'm afraid to not be successful.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.880]   I'm afraid to let other people's expectations down
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.580]   or my own expectations down.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.700]   And that's a fear that I think most of us
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.820]   from an early age have battled.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.380]   You came into the room tonight and a lot of people,
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.740]   they never get over this battle.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.520]   They live their entire life with the fear
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.140]   of letting people's expectations down
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.780]   or only okay if they feel like they're succeeding
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.340]   and doing okay and exceeding the expectations
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.320]   of themselves or of other people.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.640]   And that idea is directly connected
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.240]   to what I wanna talk about tonight, which is identity.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.620]   Because people will go their entire life
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.700]   and they'll ride the rollercoaster of emotions
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   based on finding their identity,
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.620]   which is like who I am, how I see myself,
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.060]   how I think about myself, how I handle the world.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.900]   That's identity.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.220]   And they are okay with their identity
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.420]   or okay with themselves if they feel like
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.740]   they're doing well and things are going good
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.540]   or they're approved by the people around them
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.020]   and things are not going well when they feel like
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.260]   I'm letting people down or what do they think about me.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.780]   I was talking to a counselor friend and he said,
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.540]   most people, when it comes to identity,
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.540]   it involves something like this.
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.820]   It's identity equals performance over expectations cubed.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.620]   In other words, people will find their identity
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.320]   and they're okay with themselves if their performance,
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.420]   how they're doing, how they're doing at work,
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.580]   how they're doing as a friend, how they're doing with God,
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.940]   exceeds or is bigger than expectations.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.660]   Why I said cubed is it, in his words,
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.300]   typically involves the expectations of themself
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.860]   they have for themself, of others,
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.020]   they're exceeding what other people want them to do,
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.840]   they're doing well.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.420]   If they're like, man, people are really disappointed in me,
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.980]   then they're not doing well.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.480]   And then the third one is the expectations they think
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.220]   other people have of them,
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.400]   whether or not they're even communicated.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.520]   This is the type of person who's like,
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.100]   oh man, he said I did a good job,
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.440]   but he really doesn't think I'm doing a good job.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.280]   He doesn't think I'm good at all.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.560]   He thinks I'm terrible.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.920]   That would be the person who's struggling with,
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.620]   am I meeting the expectations I think they have for me?
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.360]   And as I was talking with him and just sharing
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.400]   kind of in my own life and my own battle and journey
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.640]   with identity problems, he said,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.520]   this is the challenge most people walk through
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.520]   and they find themselves okay
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.200]   if they feel like they're doing good in life.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.120]   They find themselves not okay
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.720]   if they're not doing well in life.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.480]   And they judge doing well and not doing well
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.860]   based on the expectations of other people around them.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.480]   By other people, I mean your boss, your friends,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.280]   that little thing that goes off inside of you
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.560]   when you say something at work and they're like,
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.960]   oh my gosh, I can't believe I just said that.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.200]   What is everybody thinking about me?
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.040]   That's connected to identity.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.280]   Your inability to move on
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.760]   or your anxiousness that you feel.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.200]   I mean, think about the ways that we can obsess
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.040]   over what strangers think about you.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.880]   Maybe it's just me.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.040]   I had a staycation with my wife this past week
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.040]   and went into a hotel and I'll interact with strangers
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.960]   and I'll walk away being like,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.240]   I wonder what he thought about that interaction.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.560]   And I'm thinking about someone I've never met before,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.720]   I'll probably never see again for the rest of my life.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.000]   And it can come down to finding your identity
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.920]   and approval on what other people think
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.540]   or even what you think.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.520]   Is it possible to actually live a life
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.520]   where you operate not out of an insecurity,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.800]   not out of a fear or not out of a rollercoaster
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.160]   of like I'm doing well today
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.760]   'cause I feel like everyone's happy with me
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.760]   or I'm not doing well today
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.160]   'cause I feel like I'm letting everyone down
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.760]   or I'm not doing well
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.160]   because I'm supposed to be married by now.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.680]   I'm not in the job that I wanna be in right now.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.240]   I lost my career in COVID.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.000]   Everyone probably thinks I'm a failure.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.480]   Is it possible to not be owned by those things?
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.580]   In other words, to be so secure in your identity
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.100]   that no matter what happens around you,
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.160]   you're at peace.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.400]   And tonight I wanna talk about what the Bible says
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.680]   are three ingredients for you and I to experience that.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.000]   So we're gonna talk about Christian identity
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.720]   if you take notes.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.240]   And I'm gonna walk through three things that are involved
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.000]   for you and I to break through
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.720]   and experience a life that finds our identity
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.740]   'cause as Christians, we're promised and told
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.320]   there's a way to experience a peace,
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.240]   not the rollercoaster, not the waves of insecurity.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.560]   And it happens by finding your identity
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.040]   and who God says that you are.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.240]   So I wanna walk through really three simple things
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.080]   that you're gonna feel like, you may even think,
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.100]   oh, I've heard that before.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.160]   My guess is at some part in all of our hearts,
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.560]   you don't really believe it.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.300]   And the more that you and I do,
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.320]   the more that we're gripped by what God says,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.560]   the more you will experience freedom as it relates
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.360]   to not needing the approval of people.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.960]   So the first one, the first one has to do with worth.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.200]   If I was to say like, hey, where does your worth come from?
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.280]   I wanna talk about what the Bible says
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.480]   is directly connected to what makes you worthy.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.560]   What is incredibly value about your life?
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.280]   So the first idea is just like your value in Christ.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.440]   I wanna talk about how extraordinarily valuable
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.320]   you as a human being are.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.560]   If you were to think about it and answer the question,
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.680]   like what makes me a worthy person or valuable?
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.640]   Or is my life as valuable as the next person?
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.000]   Or is the president of the United States
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.160]   more valuable than my life?
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.840]   Or is the so-and-so person more valuable than me?
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.700]   And what would make me a person?
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.500]   It's really incredibly valuable.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.680]   The Bible answers this question.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.520]   It does so in two ways.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   It does one in a way for all people everywhere.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.080]   And it says the reason why you have such extraordinary value
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.560]   no matter if you're addicted to pornography right now,
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.640]   if you're listening in rehab, if you're in jail,
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.400]   or if you came in and everything feels great,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.680]   you have the same fixed eternal value.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.120]   You can never change it, you can't lose it
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.560]   because it all centers around you being made
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.040]   in the image of God.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.220]   No matter your biological sex, color of your skin,
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.880]   your age, how much money is in your bank account,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.520]   you have a fixed extraordinary value, God would say.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.440]   Because unlike anything else in the creation,
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.600]   you've been made in the image of God.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.400]   He says this in Genesis chapter one, verse 27 and 28.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   God says, "Let us make mankind in our image
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.380]   "He made the sun and the moon and the stars,
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.880]   "He made all the creation, He made the oceans,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.240]   "He made everything and then He came to you and me."
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.780]   He says, "Different from everything else,
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.300]   "this is going to be made in my image."
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.720]   What does it mean to be made in my image?
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.760]   My children are made in my image.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.680]   You can see the resemblance
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.980]   of their mother and father on them.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.540]   You are made in the image of your parents.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.800]   You may look back and be like, no, can't see it in there.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.880]   But there is a way in which there is a resemblance
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.880]   because you have been made in the image of them.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.400]   In the same way, God says, "Hey, all humanity,
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.920]   "unlike anything else is so extraordinarily valuable
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.660]   "'cause when I came to create everything,
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.260]   "it wasn't the sun and the moon and the stars
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.040]   "and the planets, all that stuff's cool,
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.600]   "not made in the image of God."
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.760]   It wasn't the animal kingdom,
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.600]   the craziest aquarium, animals or water.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.080]   I don't know what the word is for things
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.080]   that are in the ocean, fish, there you go.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.480]   It wasn't that, that was made in the image of God.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.760]   Feels like an easy one.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.100]   It was you.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.660]   And he would say, "You are of such extraordinary value
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.420]   "because he made you in his image."
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.640]   He said, "Let us make them so they rule over the fish
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.940]   "and the sea and the birds of the sky,
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.380]   "over the livestock, they're distinct above everything else."
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.220]   So God created them in his image, male and female,
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.180]   both made in the image of God.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.780]   Moses was the person who delivered this message.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.620]   I don't know if you know this,
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.660]   Moses wrote the book of Genesis,
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.900]   God inspired him, had him write this.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.100]   You know the audience that he told this verse to?
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.660]   It's a group of people called the Israelites.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.420]   Israelites have been enslaved for 400 years.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.260]   That's longer than America has been around.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.300]   All they'd ever known was slaves,
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.980]   all their grandparents and grandparents and grandparents
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.140]   had ever been slaves and they're set free
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.420]   and God takes them out of slavery in Egypt
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.580]   and leads them out.
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.060]   One of the first things that God says,
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.380]   "Moses, I want you to tell them,"
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.220]   'cause they may think, "Man, we're not that important
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.840]   "and we're not that valuable, we were slaves
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.040]   "and all the support or all the important Pharaoh
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.380]   "and all of his people, those are the really
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.320]   "important people," and he says,
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.820]   "No, you were made in the image of God.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:13.820]   "Your value doesn't change no matter if your behavior does,
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.460]   "your circumstances do, and your life
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.720]   "is so extraordinarily valuable."
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.460]   My son is, like I said, five,
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.100]   so one of the things that we're trying to teach him
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.620]   is how to do chores and if you do chores, you get paid.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.660]   And it's pretty awesome actually as a parent
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.440]   'cause you're like, "Oh yeah, here, do this for a penny
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.380]   "and it'll take you two hours, but go get 'em, son."
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.460]   And he doesn't know, he can't use it on anything.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.800]   He's like, "All right, cool, look at how shiny
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.700]   "this thing is."
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.860]   But anyways, as I'm talking with him,
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.700]   one thing I'd never thought of before was
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.020]   how do you explain the value of certain coins?
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.060]   Because he'll be like, "Oh, this is a penny,"
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.280]   and then I'll pull up a nickel and he's like,
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.120]   "Oh, what's this?"
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.300]   And I'm like, "That's worth five cents."
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.300]   "Oh, what's a cent?"
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.540]   And I'm like, "Well, it's like a penny."
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.760]   "Well, why don't you say it's worth five penny?"
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.360]   "Well, let's not even get there."
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.420]   And then he'll go, "What's the dime?"
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.020]   "We'll walk through and how to explain
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.500]   "or how to understand the value of something."
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.540]   And do you know what all centers on?
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.380]   It's very simple.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.860]   Whose image is on the coin?
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.780]   In other words, he's got coins like just that we have
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.860]   laying around the house from being in international trips
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.900]   to different places that are either from Mexico
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.000]   or places in Europe or places around that.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.360]   There's a copper coin, but no, no, no,
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.420]   there's no Lincoln on there.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.260]   The way that you know that, hey, it's worth a penny
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.340]   is whose image is on that.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.220]   The way that you know this is worth five cents
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.460]   is Thomas Jefferson's on there.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.940]   Whose image shows you the value of it?
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.540]   Like this penny is really interesting.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.780]   We brought a lot of pennies this week
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.020]   and I'll explain why here in a second
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.380]   and some of the locations will know.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.280]   Thousands of them.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.460]   You know what they don't have in common?
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.540]   Some of them are one year old,
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.540]   some of them are 10 years old,
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.180]   some of them have been like in New York,
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.980]   they were in a subway, they were thrown away.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.140]   Lord knows where some of these things have been.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.060]   Some of them are dirty, some of them are clean,
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.980]   but you know what they all have in common?
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.960]   No matter where they've been, no matter how they look,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.320]   they have the same worth, a penny,
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.800]   because whose image is on them.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.860]   When the Bible talks about you,
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.540]   and you gotta listen to me,
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.340]   when it talks about your worth,
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.980]   just like that penny, no matter where it's been
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.180]   or what it's done or how clean it looks
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.500]   or how clean it feels or how dirty it seems,
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.220]   its value never changes.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.340]   Same is true of you, no matter your story,
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.740]   no matter if you've been running from God,
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.280]   if you would say you're not even a Christian,
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.620]   if you feel so much shame and guilt
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.700]   from a decision in your past,
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.900]   you've never told anybody about,
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.880]   you know what doesn't change?
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.800]   No matter where you've been, what you've done,
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.580]   your worth, because of whose image is on you,
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.780]   which is the image of God.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.780]   There's not a life, if you're listening,
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.940]   and somebody needs to hear this,
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.260]   where you feel like your life is not worth living,
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.900]   you have bought a lie, because of whose image is on you.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.780]   Your value is so extraordinarily high,
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.580]   I could not put it into sentences.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.740]   And the second reason you have such extraordinary value
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.860]   is because your life, despite all the imperfections
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.260]   and all the things messed up in my life and my past,
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.900]   was so valuable to God, who loved you and I so much,
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.620]   that he would say, I'm willing to even give
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.460]   my own son's life for you.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.660]   We think of that, it's not like generic,
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.020]   like yeah, he kind of gave it for all of us.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.300]   No, he gave it for you.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.420]   He died in your place.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.820]   In Economics 101, if you remember,
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.120]   back in like eighth grade or whenever you took econ,
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.840]   they would tell you that the price of a thing,
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.300]   the value of a thing is determined
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.540]   by the price it will bring.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.140]   In other words, how do you know how valuable something is?
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.740]   If I was like, oh yeah, this thing is worth $10 million.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.220]   It would only be worth $10 million
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.420]   if somebody said, I'll pay that.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.000]   That's how you know how much it's actually worth.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.700]   Whatever someone's willing to pay,
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.660]   shows you what it's worth.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.800]   When it came to you and it came to me,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.540]   how extraordinarily valuable are you
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.180]   that God would say, here's what I'm willing to pay,
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.060]   my own eternal life.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.980]   And for you to experience freedom from identity,
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.740]   you got to know you are so valuable to God.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.220]   And your worth has nothing to do with your past,
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.300]   your family, your story.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.540]   It's because you've been made in the image of God.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.880]   And whatever that past and story was,
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.480]   God loves you so much, he would die for you.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.200]   And that doesn't change if you lose your job.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.320]   That doesn't change if you break up.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.340]   That doesn't change if you had an abortion.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.240]   That doesn't change if you have same sex attraction.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.240]   Because your worth doesn't depend on those things.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.220]   You're made in the image of God.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.400]   Second thing, if you're gonna experience freedom
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.520]   from identity, or part of embracing the true identity
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.280]   that can bring freedom from like, man, I'm okay
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.080]   with what other people think about me,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.960]   is understanding that you, if you are a Christian,
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.520]   have been accepted in Christ.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.640]   Then when it came to you and it came to the question,
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.680]   I'm like, am I okay, am I enough, am I good enough?
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.080]   God has already definitively said, yes.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.800]   When you put your faith in Jesus,
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.200]   everything he did on the cross, it applied to you.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.940]   And he has said, you are enough.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.440]   You are accepted.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.760]   You are accepted by God.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.380]   You are accepted by the one whose opinion matters more
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.100]   than any other opinion.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.320]   He says this in Romans chapter eight, starting in verse one.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.940]   There is therefore now no condemnation.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.640]   That means no question marks, that means no,
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.200]   I'm not really sure, that means no,
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.500]   maybe they didn't make it.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.080]   None of that, for those who are in Christ.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.680]   Because through Jesus Christ, the law of the spirit
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.260]   who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.420]   Basically all that means is that Jesus on the cross
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.120]   accomplished, hey, there's nothing held against you.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.720]   You're enough, you're accepted.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.640]   You've always been loved, but when you came to faith
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.860]   in Christ, you're now accepted and adopted in his family.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.880]   For what the law, or what behavior in doing good things
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.800]   was powerless to do because it was weakened
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.380]   by our sin nature of the flesh, God did.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.580]   By sinning his own son so that the requirement
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.960]   of the law would be fully met in us.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.880]   That Christ answers the question, I am accepted.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.240]   You are accepted in Christ, not because of the things
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.640]   that you've done or haven't done, or your behavior,
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.640]   or you deserve it, because he loved you so much
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.160]   that when you put your faith in Jesus,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.080]   I'm not trusting in how good of a person I am,
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.120]   I'm trusting solely in what you did on the cross,
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.520]   dying in my place, rising from the grave,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.720]   you paid for my sin.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.960]   When that happens, God says, accepted.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.720]   You have been welcomed and accepted and invited
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.320]   into a relationship and nothing can break that relationship
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.360]   and nothing you do can get you out of it.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.680]   And you've been accepted by the one who matters most.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.960]   How can that happen?
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.760]   I was getting a golf lesson this past weekend,
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.440]   I'm terrible at golf, my father-in-law gave me
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.600]   golf clubs for Christmas.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.440]   Along with that, he was like,
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.880]   I'm also gonna get you a golf lesson.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.560]   Go to the golf lesson, golf instructor,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.520]   never been here before, walk up to the guy,
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.500]   and I'm bad at golf.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.880]   I go to the guy and he's like, I understand you,
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.840]   trying to learn golf, and I'm like,
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.580]   that may be an understatement, like I am terrible at golf
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.980]   and so I don't have anything to bring to the table,
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.220]   you just tell me what to do and I'll do that
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.340]   and I'm not at all good, so you help me,
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.380]   I have nothing to bring you.
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.260]   And he looked at me and he said,
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.860]   you're my favorite type of person to work with.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.700]   'Cause you're not gonna come in here
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.860]   and have all these forms and be like,
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.780]   yeah, you did it that way, but I like to do it like this.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.060]   You're just gonna go, hey, I'll do whatever
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.180]   you want me to do.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.780]   My favorite person to work with.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.000]   It seems to be when you read the scriptures,
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.640]   God's favorite person to work with is the person who says,
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.360]   look, I don't deserve a relationship with you,
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.080]   I don't deserve to spend eternity with you,
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.760]   I've done things in my past that I know were wrong,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.280]   I feel shame and guilt for those things,
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.760]   God will do whatever you need me to do,
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.460]   I bring nothing to the table.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.940]   I need a savior.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:07.200]   The scriptures say, that's his favorite person to work with,
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.360]   that is the only person he will work with.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:15.060]   So you're invited and you've been accepted by God,
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.320]   which answers the question,
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:23.120]   do I need to look for acceptance anywhere else?
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.760]   And the truth is, if that's true,
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.160]   like if I really have been,
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.720]   I have the approval of the only one who matters.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.200]   It doesn't matter what you think about me,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.040]   what you think about me, what you think about me,
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.440]   what you think about me, what you think about me,
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.560]   because I know what he thinks about me.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.080]   And I can walk and rest in that.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.380]   And part of experiencing a freedom in your identity,
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.360]   not being consumed by your expectations or others on you,
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.860]   is knowing, man, I've been accepted, I have a peace,
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.320]   'cause I've been accepted, I'm okay.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.660]   It's crazy how no matter how successful you are in life,
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.860]   you wonder the question, like, am I enough?
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.020]   Am I okay?
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.820]   Like, am I worthy of being accepted
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.200]   or worthy of being loved?
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.060]   The reason I say no matter how successful
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:13.980]   and how high you climb,
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.180]   this question seems to still be asked is,
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:21.140]   you'll see evidence and people incredibly high in society
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.980]   and successful celebrities and politicians
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.100]   and people who just arrived
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.760]   and they still have that insecurity of, am I okay?
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.220]   Do you think they accept me?
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.300]   There was a story, Oprah Winfrey,
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.920]   she gave her commencement speech at Harvard.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.940]   She said something really interesting about this idea
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.620]   of how no matter how successful you are,
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.540]   you still have that, like, am I okay question,
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.520]   unless you find it in Christ.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.580]   She said this in her Harvard speech.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:53.480]   "I've done over 35,000 interviews in my 27-year career.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.060]   "As soon as the camera shuts off,"
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.300]   and I'm in that interview, "everyone," this is so crazy,
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.380]   "everyone turns to me and inevitably,
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.700]   "inevitably, in their own way, asks this question,
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.460]   "was that okay?
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.960]   "I heard it from President Bush,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.440]   "from President Barack Obama.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.200]   "I've heard it from heroes and from housewives.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.640]   "I've heard it from victims and perpetrators of crimes.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.480]   "I've even heard it from Beyonce, in all her Beyonce-ness.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.400]   "They all wanna know one thing, is that okay?
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.440]   "Am I okay?"
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.880]   It's a question that unless you find the answer in Christ,
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.320]   you're never gonna have the answer that satisfies.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.560]   It's a question that people will spend their entire life
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.680]   trying to compensate, try to make more money,
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.840]   try to be more successful,
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.560]   try to prove my worth to other people.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.680]   Not knowing the answer to this question
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.640]   is why some of you guys have lowered your standards
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.540]   so low in dating.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.120]   And you'll end up in relationships
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.360]   with people that are so toxic
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.480]   'cause you don't have any standards
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.000]   because you don't think yourself
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.800]   as someone who's of incredible value,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.200]   who's been accepted by the one who matters most.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.560]   Of course you're gonna tolerate it.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.800]   This question, I mean, think about back in high school.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.000]   I don't know if you guys have talked to high schoolers
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.200]   recently or been around in high schools.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   When I first started ministry,
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.320]   I worked in high school ministry.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.560]   I don't know that there is more of an insecure time in life
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.060]   than middle school and high school.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.920]   You're walking around, you got pimples on your face,
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.120]   you got braces in your teeth,
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.760]   you're just like trying to prove everything,
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.360]   and you're going through puberty
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.200]   and you don't have armpit hair
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.400]   or you have too much armpit hair,
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.860]   or you're just like so much insecurity.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.660]   And especially now, if you interact with kids in high school,
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.440]   you can see it and you wanna go back
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.360]   and talk to yourself in high school
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.640]   or talk to high schoolers now and be like,
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.960]   "Look, hey, I know you're freaking out
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.920]   about what did Chelsea say,
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.920]   and she did this TikTok video.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.040]   Now everyone at school thinks that you're like,
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.720]   I know you're freaking out right now.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.360]   And you're like, oh, I should just die,
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.580]   lock me in my room."
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.880]   In a very short amount of time,
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.880]   I mean like two years, maybe less,
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.440]   all of those opinions that you are panicked about
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.100]   and sick to your stomach about and freaking out about,
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:14.100]   and all of those people, they won't even be in your life.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.940]   Hit the pressure release valve.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.700]   But they're in that moment, they just can't let it go.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.060]   And like, "Oh my gosh, it's the biggest deal in the world.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.980]   I can't believe this happened.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.780]   And she's gonna go with her to homecoming
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.860]   and my whole life is ruined.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.900]   We have the same color dress and I'm freaking out."
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.140]   And you're like, "Oh man, it's gonna be okay."
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.840]   Right?
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.640]   So much of our life is spent in that same way.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.680]   You just can't see it in the moment.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.480]   It's easy to see when you look back.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.080]   There's gonna be coworkers, there's people in your life,
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.560]   there's relationships you have right now.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:52.200]   And in five years, three years, 10 years,
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.240]   they won't be the ones
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.680]   that are still consistently around you.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.400]   How long are you gonna find your identity
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.480]   in what they think about you?
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.880]   How long are you gonna search for acceptance
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.880]   in what they think about you
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.580]   and whether or not you're meeting their expectations
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.420]   or you think you're meeting their expectations?
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.780]   And the answer to that question is however long that is,
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.700]   is the same amount of time you're gonna keep riding
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.220]   the roller coaster and the wave.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.360]   And there is another way.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:20.380]   Say, "Man, I'm accepted because of what Christ has done,
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.700]   who he is in my life."
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:26.860]   Galatians chapter one, verse 10 says, Paul writing,
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.860]   "Am I trying to win the approval of humans or of God?"
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.100]   And then he gives the answer.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.620]   "If I was trying to please people,
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.260]   I could not be a servant of Christ."
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.680]   And it's embracing, I've been accepted by God
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.160]   whose opinion matters most of me, of you,
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.660]   not a future version of you,
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.220]   not someday when you stop sinning,
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.440]   not someday when you get more Bible verses memorized,
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.500]   not someday when you get it all together.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.780]   Now, he loves you.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.960]   And you don't have to seek and search
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.260]   and try to earn that from him.
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.620]   You have it if you put your faith in Jesus.
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.960]   And now you can walk knowing I have been accepted.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.700]   And no matter what I do for the rest of my life
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.000]   or what I don't do or what I don't accomplish,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.060]   the one whose opinion matters most has been clear.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.520]   I am approved and accepted.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:27.500]   Finally, third thing related to experience of freedom
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.380]   and an identity level is having a death grip
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.780]   on your worth, how valuable you are in Christ,
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.340]   how you've been accepted in Christ,
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:43.020]   and how through him, you and I can be complete in Christ.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.980]   We can live and operate out of a fullness,
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.380]   not of a need for people to fill something else,
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.060]   not of a need for a job to bring us
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.700]   some sort of validation that we matter in life,
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.780]   not of a need for a relationship or being married
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.000]   or having kids to fill some hole in us
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.140]   because the only one who can fill that hole
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:04.060]   is Jesus and in Christ and through walking with him
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:08.300]   in relationship, I can experience being filled from there.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.220]   He says this in Colossians chapter two, verses eight
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:15.060]   through 10, "For in Christ, the fullness of deity,"
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.900]   that's God, "lives in bodily form, fully God in Jesus.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.620]   "And in Christ, you have been brought to fullness."
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.620]   Jesus, fully God in human form, and that fullness
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.900]   through God in Jesus has now been brought about in you.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.900]   The same word for fullness is complete.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.660]   That you need to know that in Christ, you are offered
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:41.500]   that thing, that itch, the hole that sometimes
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.660]   can go looking for something, you just gotta fill this.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:45.780]   It's not gonna be found anywhere else
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.980]   because you can be complete in Christ or only in Christ
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.820]   can you be complete, which is the third point for tonight.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:56.220]   Your true identity and an identity
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.820]   that will actually bring freedom,
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.740]   will never come from what you achieve,
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.500]   but what you receive in Jesus.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.660]   That you will never experience it or any true identity
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.420]   or any actual identity that brings about peace
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.340]   and like, man, I'm okay, will never come
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.300]   from something you achieve.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.580]   It only comes from receiving in Christ.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.540]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.300]   A lot of us, when it comes to our identity,
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.460]   we think of it as things that kind of make ourselves up.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.940]   So some of it's good, some of it's bad,
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.260]   but I would say, if I asked you, sat down and said,
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.060]   tell me who you are, you may walk through
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.140]   and so deeply connected in how you see yourself
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.260]   and I said, really, like explain,
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.500]   like tell me, describe yourself.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.460]   And you go like, some of it would be related
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.780]   to your skin color, man, I'm white
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.620]   or I have darker, beautiful brown complexion.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.940]   I'm Hispanic in my heritage, I have blue eyes,
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.580]   I have yellow hair, I have red hair,
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.500]   I have, you would describe yourself.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.820]   So there's physical characteristics.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.980]   Then you would tell us your age
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.140]   and you would begin to comprise that
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:57.980]   and then I'd say, what do you do?
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.260]   And you'd be like, well, here's what job that I do.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.460]   I'm an accountant or I work for Deloitte in consulting
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.060]   or you would begin to fill in the blank
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.100]   and what education?
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.060]   Well, I'm a Baylor grad or I'm an Aggie grad
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.140]   or I'm an No grad.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.500]   You'd say, I'm self-made, I'm an entrepreneur
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.300]   and you'd walk through, I'm a TikTok influencer, wannabe.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.100]   And you would begin to explain like, here's who they are
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.460]   and you, without knowing it, most of us
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.700]   would begin to fill up like, this is who I am
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.740]   and I find my identity, some of it in good things,
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.740]   some of it in bad things.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.180]   Man, I'm a loser, I'm athletic, I'm not athletic.
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.940]   I'm smart, I'm not smart.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.220]   A lot of times the things that we find identity in,
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.300]   they can become idols inside of our life
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.940]   and they fill up in the way that we see ourself.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.620]   That was you, with a cylinder being you
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.140]   and there's these things that comprise our identity.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.500]   Christ wants us to operate in a way
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.260]   where when it comes to my identity,
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.540]   those things are maybe a part of my life
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.540]   but they're not my truest and deepest
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.820]   and most meaningful sense of my identity
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.020]   because those things are just on the surface.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.300]   Who I am comes from something so much deeper.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.780]   I'm someone who's made in the image of God.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.940]   I'm a child of God.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.620]   I'm someone who's forgiven.
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.420]   Someone who has a abiding relationship with Christ.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.220]   And the more that you and I can live from a place
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.620]   where I'm operating out of a fullness in my life
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:21.060]   that I'm being filled up or I have been filled up
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.300]   and I'm marked not by all the things
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.540]   that the world looks on and says,
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.220]   man, this is what your identity is found in
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.500]   or this is really who you are
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.700]   and this makes you important
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.980]   or this makes you successful.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.900]   The more that I'm full and completed
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.620]   and operating out of a real confidence
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:41.900]   relationship with God.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.740]   The more of those things, it's not that they disappear,
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.860]   just don't define me.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.420]   They're just on the surface
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.220]   because I'm filled with Jesus.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.660]   And there'll be things that I'm tempted
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.340]   and they come along and I'm afraid,
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.300]   like what if we end up breaking up
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.180]   or what if I lose my job
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.860]   and I'm pushing them in here.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.580]   The more that I'm filled with the spirit of Christ
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.380]   and I'm walking with Jesus and I'm spending time with him
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.180]   and allowing his spirit to remind me of who I am,
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.820]   the more I see that these things are just on the surface.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.380]   Just don't define me.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.460]   Which means if they come and go,
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.700]   it doesn't change who I am.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.800]   You may never be a mom.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.740]   That doesn't mean you're not of extraordinary value
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.100]   and you're not accepted by God.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.220]   You may never make over $100,000.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.180]   You may never make over $20,000.
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.740]   That doesn't change who you are.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.900]   You are a person.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.420]   You are made in the image of God.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.780]   You've been accepted by the one who matters most
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.980]   and you have the opportunity to be complete in Christ.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.580]   There's a lot of people that make 200K
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.820]   and they're not satisfied and they're empty
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.060]   and they find themselves,
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.500]   they find their value, their worth,
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.500]   their identity in what they do
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.100]   rather than operating out of a fullness
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.540]   and a satisfaction that is in Christ.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.860]   And Paul says, you and I,
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.520]   because of what Jesus did on the cross,
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.260]   have access to operating in a way that is fully complete.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.620]   Not that it will need,
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.420]   or not that it won't need continually going back
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.580]   and abiding with Jesus and helping
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.620]   and wrapping my identity around,
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.020]   hey, that's not who I am.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.240]   That's not what defines me.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.420]   It's gonna be okay.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.480]   Things fall apart.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.180]   I'm gonna be okay.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.980]   But that only happens when we continue
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.420]   to fill and be filled and find our true identity
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.020]   in Him and what He says about us.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.940]   One of the ways you can know
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.320]   that there could be something
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.020]   that is fighting for your identity
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.380]   is if there's a sense of anxiety
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.300]   over if something was threatening it.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.540]   Maybe it's external looks or maybe it's a job
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.580]   or maybe it's, I don't know what it could be.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.740]   Throughout just the past few months,
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:53.180]   I've come through a counselor and community
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.540]   and through some people on my team
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.060]   to see that there's some ways in which my identity
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:04.060]   has been wrapped up and attached to my job at the porch.
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.260]   And really to what God is doing here
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.420]   and not in a way that's like, man,
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.260]   just build a bigger name,
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.980]   but in a way that is unhealthy.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.660]   I mean, it's actually like, man,
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.940]   seeing this thing succeed
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.140]   and seeing young adults reach and seeing it,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:26.740]   God in His kindness has helped me begin to see that.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.620]   And just in processing that and seeing
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.540]   and just how it could work myself out
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.020]   and specifically in the fall,
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.220]   there was some additional responsibilities
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.420]   that took me out of running
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.020]   the day-to-day operations of the porch.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.480]   And that led to me, because of that identity
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.580]   and not being okay with,
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.840]   man, I don't know how things are gonna go,
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.400]   micromanaging from afar,
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.900]   being inconsiderate with last minute changes,
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.440]   impatient with the status of things,
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.440]   unloving and less than sensitive in communication,
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.360]   and really damaged some people
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.100]   that I love and care about deeply on my team.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.780]   And so through processing with community
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.780]   and through processing just with friends,
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.160]   it became clear, man,
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.780]   I need to take a step back
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.740]   and step towards running through Jesus
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.020]   and starve out any part of me
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:22.780]   that thinks my identity is found in the porch.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.260]   In a way that I honestly don't even know
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.020]   how long that's been there or how,
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:26.860]   when it developed.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.020]   I was telling someone earlier,
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.540]   pretty sure it wasn't 12 years ago.
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.580]   I'm pretty sure at some point,
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.220]   but I do think being removed didn't create it,
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.380]   it exposed it, the ability to let it go.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.940]   So the next little season,
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.080]   what I'm gonna do is let it go
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.940]   and take a step back in this next few weeks
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.740]   in this series in general that we're about to kick off,
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.960]   that's gonna be amazing.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.280]   Step back and have a little like,
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.040]   man, God, you got this.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.820]   And any part of me that doesn't believe that,
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.800]   you got this and I trust you with that.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.640]   I'm gonna run after and prioritize loving
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.720]   and caring for my team and working on that in myself.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:08.860]   And the porch in the meantime is gonna be in great hands
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.680]   because it will be in the same hands
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.580]   it has always been in, which is God's.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.900]   But that being said, we're so pumped.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.820]   We're starting a brand new series next week.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.660]   It's gonna be awesome.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.820]   I can't wait to hear and learn and encourage,
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.620]   be encouraged alongside of all of you guys.
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:26.740]   But that's something where I love this ministry.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.680]   I've given over a third of my life to it.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.380]   But I love Jesus more.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.380]   And I wanna do anything that I can
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.260]   to see him take ground and see that identity
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.100]   that I know is mine because he said it,
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.660]   be experienced and lived out.
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.480]   I don't know what you need to let go of.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.980]   And that isn't just some like preaching analogy
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.540]   of like, that's me and now you.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:53.760]   I'm saying, I know that's when I need to.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.460]   And my guess is inside of the room,
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:01.600]   there's something some other ones of us may need to as well.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.580]   The penny that I was gonna hand out of the door
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:12.580]   we were just talking through and decided, you know what?
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.020]   If they did that, they'd put it in their pocket.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.660]   They wouldn't do anything with it.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:20.460]   So we scattered them all outside of this room in the lobby.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.860]   All the different locations, my assumption is
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.060]   they probably handed them out of the door,
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.740]   but it still worked the same way.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.780]   As you walk outside, the reason why we scatter them
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.840]   is we're gonna see them all over the ground.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.220]   A lot of us, when we see a penny on the floor,
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.140]   like we don't even hesitate.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.140]   We don't even pin it over.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.220]   We don't even think it's worth our time
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.620]   to bend over and pick it up.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.740]   And I want you as you walk outside of those doors,
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.100]   I want you to grab a penny.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.660]   And when you bend down and when you pick it up,
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.780]   I want you to remember
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:56.620]   that is exactly what God through Christ did for you.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.020]   What other people, what other people,
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.640]   yourself may even think like, I'm not worthy.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.020]   I'm not worthy of being cared about
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.900]   or worthy of being reached out and picked up.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.420]   That question has been answered
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.460]   because God through Christ on the cross bend over
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.580]   and he loved you and you were so valuable to him
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.620]   that he said, I will go to whatever lengths
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.900]   and leave heaven itself to stoop down and to pick you up.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.020]   And when you pick up that penny, I want you to think,
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.220]   this is how much my God,
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.100]   despite the fact that other people may think
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.140]   it's not really worth that much,
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.100]   you are worth so much to him, no matter the cost,
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.500]   that he would stoop down and he would pick it up.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.980]   And the next time you walk along and you see a penny,
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.460]   something that other people may pass by
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.980]   and not think is any thing of significance,
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.020]   I want you to pick it up.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.140]   And I want you to remember the God
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.820]   who chases after sinners and broken people
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:43.820]   who don't think they're worth it,
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.780]   don't think they're acceptable and he loves them,
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.780]   displays their value to him through the lengths he's gone.
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.800]   And remember who you are, whose image is on you,
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.640]   how valuable you are, whose acceptance in Christ you have.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.660]   And that you and I are offered a life
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.640]   through continually walking with Jesus, we are complete.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.620]   Let me pray.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:22.340]   Father, I thank you that you stoop down
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:27.540]   and you pick up identity,
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:33.280]   broken sinners like me,
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.000]   that the links that you go
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.280]   for people unworthy,
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.460]   quite literally knew no bounds.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.580]   And so I pray for anyone tonight and all of us to have this,
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.240]   for any parts in all of our hearts
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.200]   where we don't believe that,
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.920]   we don't believe you're enough,
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.080]   we don't believe who you say we are,
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.240]   we don't believe that we've been accepted,
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.800]   we don't live in light of that.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:10.140]   We don't really believe that we could be okay
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:15.140]   if everything was stripped from us because we have you.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:21.640]   And so God, would you help us by your spirit to believe,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.220]   to rest in, to trust in, to walk with, to abide with,
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.440]   to run towards you.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.480]   For for anyone who's never put their faith in Jesus,
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.140]   that as they go and they pick up a penny,
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:41.320]   the message of a God who left heaven for them,
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.040]   who came to earth born as a baby for them,
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.680]   who was crucified on a tree for them,
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.820]   for their sin,
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.860]   and who rose from the dead for them,
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.920]   that they would accept not the gift of a single penny,
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.880]   but the gift of your son on the cross and his life,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.740]   and by that decision would have eternal life,
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.040]   would be redefined, have their past totally forgiven,
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.880]   their future totally paid for,
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.240]   and be accepted by the one who matters most.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.520]   We love you.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.480]   We worship you now in song, amen.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.240]   (water bubbling)
