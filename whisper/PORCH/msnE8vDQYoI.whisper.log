[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.000]   - All right, how we doing Dallas?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.160]   (audience cheering)

[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.120]   I love that, I love that.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.560]   Well, welcome everybody,
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.300]   Dallas and Fort Worth and streaming online.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.240]   My name's Adam Tarnow.

[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.520]   Start off with a little question.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.800]   How many of you guys like watching those videos
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.120]   or reading those articles about life hacks?
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.360]   Any life hack fans out here?
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.620]   A few of you guys, life hacks.

[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.000]   In fact, I typed in the other day on YouTube,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   10 best life hacks, 36.3 million videos popped up.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.800]   All right, so these are these videos
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.320]   that show you simple solutions to everyday problems
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.160]   that you might have.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.420]   And so some of the popular videos
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.240]   that are out there right now
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.960]   with some of the highest views on YouTube,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.520]   10 life hacks that every college student should know.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.460]   It's got 30 million views on that
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.120]   for our college student friends in the room.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.740]   The number one life hack video out there, ladies,
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.080]   this is free advice.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.240]   It's called the DIY makeup life hacks.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.760]   54 million views out there on that.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.600]   I like these things.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.420]   I watch these videos.
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.260]   I don't watch the makeup one,
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.660]   but I've watched some of the other ones.
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.520]   And I got some pictures too,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.720]   'cause some of these, you'll see these life hacks
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.600]   in like in articles or something like that.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.860]   And so here's like one of the first one.
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620]   This is a good example of a life hack
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.260]   is if you got a strawberry
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.140]   and you wanna know how to get that little stem off the top,
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.040]   because God forbid we ever use a knife for that, right?
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.060]   That's way too much work to do that.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.600]   So you just stick a straw through there.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.200]   Guys, here's another one that's super helpful for you.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.040]   I don't know you,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.240]   but I'm willing to bet your bathroom is disgusting.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.840]   And so that one right there would help you.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.400]   How many of us like grilled cheese?
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.080]   But who wants to get a skillet out, right?
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.320]   If it's time to do that, just turn your toaster sideways.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.480]   That's genius right there.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.440]   That's gonna be for some of you, unfortunately,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.080]   that's gonna be the most helpful thing you see
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.400]   all night tonight is that.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.240]   And you're like, "Porch, I don't know, man.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.480]   "That grilled cheese thing is awesome."
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.520]   Here's one of my favorites, just kind of ridiculous.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.680]   One of these, if you look at this one, this guy.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.440]   So if you just turn your hoodie around the other way,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.960]   it becomes a horse trough for you
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.520]   or something like that, right?
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.840]   I think there's some porch hoodies in the back.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.480]   You guys wanna Instagram that next week
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.480]   or something to make that the gift
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.400]   that you give out or so that.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.600]   So anyway, so these life hacks, I mean, we all love them.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.760]   And the reason we love them is because they're helpful,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.560]   because there are little problems
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.040]   that we didn't know that we had,
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.720]   like how to eat popcorn and type at the same time.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.160]   We didn't know we had that problem,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.120]   but man, it is great to know
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.880]   that there is a solution to those problems.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.000]   And so I start with that tonight,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.440]   because what we're gonna do tonight
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.720]   is we're actually gonna look at a biblical life hack.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.600]   We're gonna look at a life hack that is in scripture.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.400]   In fact, one scholar would say
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.760]   that the verse that we're gonna look at tonight
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.800]   in all of the New Testament, this might be, in his opinion,
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.400]   the most helpful verse in the entire New Testament.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.160]   There's over 7,900 verses in the New Testament.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.360]   And one scholar would say this one,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.680]   the one that we're gonna look at tonight
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.600]   is the most helpful.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.400]   And the reason it's the most helpful
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.880]   is because it helps us with the situation
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.960]   that we all face every single day.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.760]   And so we may not all face some of those life hacks
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.600]   that we see out there.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.480]   That may not be problems that we're facing every day,
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   but I promise you this,
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.120]   the one that we're gonna talk about tonight
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.400]   is a problem that you and I face every single day.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.200]   And I would go so far as to say this too,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.600]   that if we don't get our arms around this issue
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.320]   that we're gonna talk about tonight,
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.160]   if we don't get our arms around this issue,
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.760]   then this could be the thing that is gonna prevent you and I
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.880]   from becoming the person that we wanna be.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.840]   This, if we don't get our arms around this,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.160]   this could be the difference between whether or not
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.440]   we become the person we wanna become,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.000]   or if we fast forward 20, 30, 40 years,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.600]   we're just a shadow,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.080]   just a shadow of the person that we wanna become today.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.120]   And so tonight is going to be an incredibly helpful night
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.320]   looking at a life hack that will help us
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320]   in all of these different,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.040]   or specifically in one situation
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.480]   that all of us face every single day.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.680]   And that situation is this,
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.480]   the situation is temptation.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.120]   And what I mean when I say temptation is this,
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.600]   it's all these little decisions
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.280]   that you and I have to make every day
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.520]   as to whether or not we're gonna do something
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.640]   that is going to please God or not please God.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.880]   It's all these decisions we have to make every day
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.440]   to sin or not to sin,
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.800]   making decisions every day,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.120]   we're faced with a multiple times a day,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.640]   these decisions to do what God says is best,
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.920]   or go our own way and do something that we think is best.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.480]   And so every single one of us in the room tonight,
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.800]   we all face temptation and we face it multiple times a day.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.520]   And so what we're gonna see tonight
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.280]   is we're gonna see a hack.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.880]   We're gonna see a way that we can handle this
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.440]   so that we can get our arms around this.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.720]   What is a way that we should think about temptation
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.760]   that is gonna be incredibly helpful for us?
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.960]   And so tonight too, I know in a room this size
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.880]   that not everybody in here tonight
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.680]   would probably claim to be a follower of Jesus Christ
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.440]   or call themselves a Christian.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.800]   And so if you're in the room tonight
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.600]   and that's not you, you wouldn't call yourself a Christian,
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.880]   you wouldn't call yourself a follower of Jesus.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.720]   You're just trying to figure out who Jesus is
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.360]   or you're trying to figure out who God is.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.920]   And you're just here because a friend invited you
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.440]   or you're here because a coworker invited you.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.280]   I just wanna let you know
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.840]   that a lot of what I'm gonna talk about tonight,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.000]   I'm actually not gonna be talking to you.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.640]   I'm actually gonna be talking to Christians.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.400]   And so tonight what you get to do
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.120]   is I think you're still gonna learn something,
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.960]   but what you get to do
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.360]   is you get to watch all the Christians squirm, right?
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.400]   So you can just sit there
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.560]   and watch them and I think if you listen,
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.760]   you're gonna learn a couple of things
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.040]   and there may be some stuff that's in there that's helpful.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.160]   But tonight we're primarily
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.560]   going to be talking to Christians
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.080]   because the letter that we're gonna read from
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.000]   was written to Christians.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   It was written to Christians
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.440]   in a specific situation that they were facing.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.280]   So if you got your Bibles,
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.600]   let's open up to 1 Corinthians 10.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.160]   That's where we're gonna be tonight.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.920]   It's just gonna be one verse that we'll be in tonight,
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.080]   but it's got three sentences
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.640]   and there's a lot packed in there.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.920]   And so it's gonna be worth it for us
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.360]   just to kind of camp out
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.720]   in this one verse tonight.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.280]   And so 1 Corinthians 10,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.800]   specifically we're gonna look at verse 13.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.200]   And so let me just set up the context a little bit
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.040]   for this verse.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.840]   So Paul, the apostle Paul,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.120]   this guy, the apostle Paul,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.280]   he had planted this church
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.320]   or helped start this church
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.640]   in this ancient city of Corinth.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.760]   And then he was out planting other churches.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.320]   And as he was out planting other churches,
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.760]   he heard some news
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.040]   about some things that were going on
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.720]   in this church in Corinth.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.120]   And so Paul wanted to address some things that he had heard.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.600]   He wanted to answer some questions.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.120]   And so he did what you did in the first century
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.480]   when you wanted to communicate with somebody
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.760]   and you weren't in the same town,
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.840]   he wrote a letter.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.960]   And so this is his first letter
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.560]   that he wrote to the church in Corinth.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.240]   We call it 1 Corinthians.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.880]   That's the way it is in our New Testament.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.320]   And so here's what was going on.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.680]   There were a lot of things going on
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.000]   in that particular city
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.080]   and that church was dealing with.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.320]   But the situation right now
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   or one of the situations that we know
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.400]   that they were dealing with is this,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.560]   is that the church in Corinth
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.840]   had started to get a little bit arrogant.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.880]   They had started to become a little bit lax.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.480]   They had started to become a little bit lax
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.760]   in their relationship with sin.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.840]   They started to think that maybe sin
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.040]   wasn't a big deal to them
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.000]   or sin just wasn't a big deal in general.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.240]   And so their attitudes and their relationship with sin
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.240]   had started to kind of wane a little bit.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.360]   And Paul caught wind of this.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.200]   And he, in chapter 10,
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.480]   as he's writing about a whole bunch of things
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.200]   and he gets to chapter 10 and he's reminding them,
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.000]   hey, don't be arrogant.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.840]   Don't be arrogant.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.960]   Don't think that you can just automatically stand in sin
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.680]   or have this very lax attitude towards sin.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.000]   And then what he does in chapter 10 is he goes back
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.840]   and he shares stories from their Old Testament,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.920]   from our Old Testament about the Israelites.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.200]   And he shares stories with them and say,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   hey, remember they too one time were lax and arrogant
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.400]   in their relationship with sin.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.800]   And we remember what God did to them.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.280]   And we remember the judgment that was there.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.680]   And we remember the destruction
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.920]   that their sin brought into them.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.280]   And we remember that God,
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.080]   God didn't want them to become arrogant
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.160]   or be lax in their relationship with sin.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.440]   And that those stories are preserved as a warning for you
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.000]   and preserved as a warning for us.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.080]   And so he was encouraging them to not be arrogant.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.960]   And that's where we get to this verse.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.240]   So after he is saying, hey, remember,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.600]   remember God, he's gonna deal with this.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.560]   Don't be arrogant.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.600]   Don't be lax in your relationship with sin.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.400]   And here's what he says in verse 13.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.200]   He reminds them this,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.520]   that no temptation has overtaken you
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.520]   except what is common to mankind.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.360]   And God is faithful.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.040]   He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.640]   But when you are tempted,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.640]   he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.520]   And so the first point I wanna make tonight
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.560]   from this verse is this,
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.200]   it's in this first part of this verse,
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.440]   that no temptation has overtaken you
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.160]   except what's common to mankind.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.420]   And so the first point is that temptation is unavoidable.
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.400]   For every single one of us, temptation is unavoidable.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.200]   So what this means for our life is this guys,
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.860]   it means that every single day,
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.600]   every single day when we wake up,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.720]   every single one of us,
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.760]   we are on the very edge of doing something
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.720]   that is gonna bring about a tremendous amount of destruction
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.560]   into our life.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.320]   Every single one of us, every day,
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.840]   we are at the edge of almost ruining our life all the time.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.840]   It's unavoidable.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.580]   Temptation, these decisions that we have
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.920]   to either go our way or trust God
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.440]   to do what we think is right
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.720]   or do what we know that God wants us to do,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.400]   those situations and those choices,
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.080]   we have to make those every day.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.920]   And every day, our heart is gonna be tempted
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.380]   to go our own way, to turn our back on God.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.440]   And that temptation is unavoidable.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.360]   And so what that means for you and I is this,
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.180]   is that every day we are one click away,
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.980]   one click away from bringing ruin
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.480]   and destruction into our life.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.800]   Every single day, you and I,
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.520]   we are one decision away from doing something
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.320]   that we're gonna regret for a long time.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.840]   Every single one of us, every day,
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.560]   we're one financial transaction away
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.840]   from bringing destruction.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.640]   We're one choice away from bringing destruction.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.600]   We're one text message away, one phone call away,
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.040]   one email away.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.380]   Every day, we're at this very edge
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.680]   of bringing ruin and destruction into our life.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.240]   And it's always going to be this way.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.680]   It's unavoidable.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.800]   There is no temptation that's overtaken us
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.080]   except what is common to man.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.640]   And so what this means is this,
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.580]   like we have this battle,
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.840]   this battle that's raging every day.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.780]   And what's discouraging to so many of us
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.740]   so many times is this,
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.320]   is that even if we made a good choice today,
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.880]   that doesn't guarantee
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.040]   and mean that we're gonna make a good choice tomorrow.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.720]   And the opposite of that is also true, which is hopeful.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.580]   That even if we made a poor choice today,
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.600]   that doesn't mean that we're destined
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.560]   to make a poor choice tomorrow.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.440]   So here's the way that this is kind of invading my life.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.960]   So when I was in high school,
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.720]   I was a senior in high school.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.440]   I was playing baseball at the time.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.920]   That was kind of the sport I played
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.960]   there at the end of baseball
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.040]   or at the end of my high school time.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.580]   And so I did what a lot of 18 year olds did
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.340]   when they played baseball at the time,
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.480]   is that when I was not playing
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.960]   and I was sitting on the bench,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.560]   I had a friend that introduced me to tobacco,
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.360]   to smokeless tobacco, to dip or snuff,
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.200]   whatever you guys call it.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.080]   Specifically, it was the Royal Blue can of Skull Mints.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.040]   And I put that into my mouth.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.240]   And I know some of you guys have tried that before
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.680]   and you have horror stories about how it made you throw up.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.760]   And so you never, ever wanted to try
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.400]   smokeless tobacco ever again.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.580]   That was not my story.
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.480]   I put it in my mouth and I fell in love.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.960]   I was like, this, this is amazing.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.200]   This makes me feel good.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.040]   My spit turns all these different colors.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.200]   I feel like a man.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.680]   Like this is awesome.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.700]   And so I fell in love with it.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.280]   So all throughout my senior year
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   and then all throughout my four years of college,
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.200]   one of my favorite things to do in college
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.040]   was to dip tobacco.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.560]   And so I would go to lunch.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.200]   I always did my classes in the morning.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.380]   I'd go to lunch and I'd have my afternoons off.
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.320]   And I would like, right after lunch,
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.640]   I'd go up to my dorm room.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.760]   I'd put a big old thing, a dip right there in my lip.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.920]   And I played video games for hours
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.720]   because I was a man, right?
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.340]   And it felt so powerful.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.100]   And I loved every moment of it.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.340]   Well, then I become a Christian
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.580]   and then I start to learn that,
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.140]   hey, this stuff actually like maybe causes cancer.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.540]   I have some friends that start to have some mouth surgery
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.940]   because they were dipping tobacco.
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.180]   And I'm like, okay, I'm starting to learn
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.020]   about how God has given me the gift of health
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.260]   and I need to steward this body.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260]   And so I make a decision that I'm not gonna dip tobacco.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.020]   And so I can stand up here today
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.500]   and I can tell you, I haven't dipped tobacco
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.340]   for over 20 years.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.440]   I have not done that for over 20 years.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.440]   Hey, before, hey, listen to the rest of the story.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.280]   It's not impressive.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.800]   Okay, so, but here's the deal.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.160]   So it's been 20 years, 20 years.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.240]   But just the other day after a basketball game,
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.920]   I go to QT to buy my kids a Slurpee.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.560]   And I'm sitting there and I'm paying for these Slurpees
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.120]   and I see my harlot back there, right?
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.880]   I see Skull Mint.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.380]   And guys, I'm like in a heartbeat.
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.760]   I would love, I would love nothing more
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.800]   to put you in my mouth and play video games right now.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.640]   Right?
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.160]   What's crazy to me, and guess what?
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.800]   It wasn't just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.640]   Every time over the past 20 years
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.080]   that I walk into QT or 7-Eleven or Walmart
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.340]   or Walgreens or CVS, any place that sells
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.420]   this amazing tobacco, any place I walk into,
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.120]   my heart starts to leap and I go,
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.000]   man, I would love to have that again.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.640]   It's been 20 years.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.860]   I so bad just wanna go, you know what?
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.100]   That battle's done.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.260]   I got a lot of other things that I'm battling in life.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.500]   I so bad, I wish I could sit here and tell you
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.220]   that my addiction to nicotine was something in the past,
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.940]   but it's not something in the past.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.420]   Every day I'm at the edge.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.500]   Every day I'm at the edge
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.300]   of giving into that temptation again.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.540]   And that's just one of like dozens and dozens
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.580]   of things in my life.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.020]   Every day I'm at the edge of giving in
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.540]   or this battle with lust.
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.500]   Every day I'm at the edge with my battle with greed.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.380]   Every day I have to make all these choices
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.980]   on am I gonna love people or am I gonna be selfish?
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.460]   Every day is a battle of am I gonna be joyful
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.540]   or am I gonna be depressed?
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.980]   Every day is a battle with,
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.500]   am I gonna just listen to these thoughts
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.960]   that get stuck in my head and be anxious about the future
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.340]   or am I gonna trust the Lord?
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:47.340]   Every single day is a battle because sin is unavoidable.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:52.340]   But the other thing that we get out of this first part
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.980]   of this is that not only is every day a battle,
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.900]   but what we need to remember is that nobody is unique.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.780]   Nobody's unique.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.740]   Not only to every single one of us are we facing this,
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.420]   these temptation and these choices every day,
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.300]   we're not unique in that battle.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.700]   I know for me and my shame, when I've made poor choices,
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.340]   when I've been selfish, when I've been greedy,
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.160]   when I've been lustful, when I've made those choices,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.980]   I wanna wake up the next day or I wanna,
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.460]   the feeling that I have a few minutes
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.980]   after I've made that bad choice in my depravity,
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.700]   in my darkness, I just think I'm alone.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.900]   I think I'm the only person who struggles.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.060]   I wanna hide that sin.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.220]   I don't wanna go tell somebody about that sin
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.840]   because I believe that the temptations
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.760]   that I face are unique.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.820]   And what Paul's reminding us of here
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.560]   is that nobody's unique.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.000]   There's no such thing as being terminally unique.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.180]   Nobody is unique.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.180]   So I don't know what your temptation is,
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.900]   what choices you face every day.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.260]   I don't know if it has to do with sex or anxiety
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:01.180]   or depression or body image or lust or alcohol or greed
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.780]   or selfishness or lying or people pleasing.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.020]   I don't know what it is.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.700]   It could be some things on that list.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.520]   Could be everything on that list.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.500]   What I wanna remind you of is you're not alone.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.000]   You're not the only person who battled those things today.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.660]   There not only were people in the state that battled it,
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.940]   there were people in California that battled that today,
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.180]   people in Georgia that battled that today,
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.380]   people in Indiana that battled that today.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.720]   There were people down in Mexico that battled that today,
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.020]   people down in Brazil that battled that today.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.660]   There were our friends over in China that battled that today.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.300]   And not only around the world today
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.420]   were there people that battled
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.320]   and struggled with those temptations,
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.480]   there were people back in 1980 that struggled with that,
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.920]   people back in 1970 that struggled with that,
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.020]   people back in 1880 that struggled with that
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.000]   and so on and so on and so on.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.720]   Nobody is unique.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.580]   Temptation is unavoidable.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.120]   It is a battle that we face every single day
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.140]   and we all struggle with it.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.420]   So you're not alone.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.100]   You're not alone.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.700]   Even the person sitting next to you
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.380]   had the exact same struggles you did.
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.360]   So I don't, again, I don't know,
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.800]   those of you that are here tonight,
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.140]   maybe it's your first time.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.640]   Or you're here tonight exploring God.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.800]   I don't know what your friends told you
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.100]   to get you to come into this room.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.560]   I don't know if it's your first time here tonight.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.260]   I don't know what you think about what's going on in here
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.480]   and how loudly we sing.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.180]   I don't know if for you that's the first time
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.340]   you've ever heard sober people sing that loudly.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.160]   And you're just looking around
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.980]   and you're just trying to figure out who these people are
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.460]   that are your age, seem to kind of be just like you,
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.160]   but maybe you're sitting there going,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.720]   oh, these people seem really happy.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.880]   I don't know why they're happy.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.400]   I don't know why there's a lot of side hugging
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.760]   going on right now.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.920]   I don't know.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.720]   Everybody just seems to have it put together
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.880]   and maybe you're starting to feel a little bit of shame.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.280]   Like, I don't know if I fit here.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.600]   I think everybody in this room is just good.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.800]   Let me just remind you of something,
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.040]   that who you have in this room right now,
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.080]   this room is not full of good people.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.280]   We don't sit here and we don't raise our hands
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.640]   and sing about this amazing name of Jesus
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.460]   and have these smiles on our faces
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.800]   and hug and love one another.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.720]   We do not do that because we've never made bad choices.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.840]   We make bad choices all the time.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.800]   The reason we can come in here and sing
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.480]   and the reason we can laugh and the reason we can smile
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.200]   and the reason we can love one another
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.480]   is not because we're good.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.480]   The reason we can do that is because we have a savior
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.320]   who is good.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   You are not surrounded by good people.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.680]   In fact, like take this opportunity,
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.480]   make sure your wallet is still there.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.160]   Ladies, if you wanna check your purses,
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.440]   make sure they're still there
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.740]   'cause there are some criminals in this room, right?
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.840]   Some bad people who are in this room.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.360]   But get this, get this.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.960]   We sing not because we're good.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.240]   This is the porch, it is not a museum for awesome people.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.280]   This is a hospital full of sick people
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.280]   who have found the healer and their savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.600]   This is a room full of people
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.400]   who understand that they're sinners.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.120]   But sometimes they make those choices
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.160]   and they choose poorly
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.720]   and they're not just mistakes, they're sins.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.900]   But the reason we can sing is not because we're good.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.080]   The reason we can sing is because our savior is good.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.300]   The reason we can sing is because we're forgiven.
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.600]   We're forgiven and we know that we have hope
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.960]   in the midst of temptation.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.240]   And so nobody, nobody ever faces temptation
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.840]   or temptation is unavoidable for all of us.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.040]   Let's move on, let's look at the next one.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.640]   So he says, "No temptation has overtaken you
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.560]   except what is common to man."
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.800]   And then here's where the second part of the verse,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.560]   "And God is faithful.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.840]   He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear."
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.180]   And so the second point that I wanna make tonight
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.160]   out of this passage is this,
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.760]   is that no temptation is unbearable.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.160]   No temptation is unbearable.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.520]   I don't know what this is gonna be like to you,
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.400]   but this is amazing to me to think about this,
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   to think about the implications of this truth.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.760]   I mean, that means that any choice that you and I face
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.120]   in these choices, none of them are an automatic failure.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.640]   Any choice that we face and we face every day,
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.000]   this temptation that we face,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.720]   none of those situations are so unbearable
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.680]   that the cards were stacked against us that we have to sin.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:22.400]   None of these choices that we make are automatic failures.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.560]   And so here's the way this is kind of invading
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.000]   the Tarno household right now.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.120]   I mean, this is a very real conversation
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.200]   that we're having in my house right now.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.840]   In fact, as early as Sunday night, last night, even today,
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.960]   again, we were talking about it.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.920]   And so I've got an eight-year-old and a kindergartner,
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.720]   my eight-year-old named Jake,
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.880]   they both go to the school in the neighborhood.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.960]   We live up in Richardson.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.720]   And so the second grade year, Jake, the second grader,
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.020]   we are in this phase of shepherding and parenting right now
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.080]   where Jake is starting to come home
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.680]   and repeating certain words
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.960]   that he has been hearing at school, okay?
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.880]   And so over the past two or three weeks,
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.560]   it seems like every day there's a new word.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.480]   He comes home, "Hey, dad, hey, dad, what's the H word?
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.360]   "Hey, dad, hey, dad, what's the B word?
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.640]   "Hey, dad, what's the A word?
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.940]   "Hey, dad, I heard the S word, what's the S word?
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.440]   "Hey, dad, what's the F word?
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.220]   "All right, you know.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.480]   "Hey, dad, what's the R word?
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.780]   "R, I think somebody's lying to you there.
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.520]   "I don't think there is an R word," right?
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.480]   So all these words are coming up
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.060]   and he's learning all of these things
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.460]   and we're trying to talk him through all of this.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.920]   And so here's what my son has been doing
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.140]   is he knows that he himself should not say these things.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.300]   He knows it's a heart issue,
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.760]   it indicates what's going on in his heart,
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.240]   we're trying to talk to him through all that.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.040]   But what he has had fun doing lately
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.380]   is trying to get other people to say these words.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.180]   So he'll do things like this,
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.880]   he'll go to his friends and kind of be like,
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.420]   hey, what rhymes with bell but starts with H?
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.080]   And he's trying to, and then if his friends say the word,
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.380]   he goes and tells on them.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.800]   So bad, right?
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.500]   He's grounded right now because he did that this weekend.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.500]   And so this weekend, we were playing Scrabble Jr.,
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.760]   playing Scrabble Jr.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.340]   I think you guys can see where this is going.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.980]   And I'm watching him over across the table
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.140]   and I noticed he's got three tiles turned upside down.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.380]   And then he's got four tiles that he's trying to work with.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.880]   And he keeps asking, "Who has a K?
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.320]   "Who has a K?"
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.620]   And I'm like, oh, he's just trying to spell duck
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.180]   right there on the board.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.180]   That's an actual word in Scrabble Jr., look it up.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.100]   And so finally, like towards the end,
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.600]   he pulls, he goes, "Yes, I got a K."
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.800]   And he turned over that tile, those four,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.200]   and he looks at his brother and he goes,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.300]   "Joshua, turn these over."
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.300]   And I'm like, no, no, no, Joshua, do not turn those over.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.540]   Do not do that right now, don't.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.040]   And I mean, like, it's just his mind, he's got these words.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.720]   I mean, last night, right before he went to bed,
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.040]   he was like, "Dad, did you know,
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.820]   "we've got some friends with the last name Schmidt."
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:01.720]   He's like, "Do you know that if you take the word Schmidt,
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.120]   "if you take the M out, it's the S word."
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.920]   And I'm like, son, I've been alive for almost 42 years,
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.460]   and I've never thought of that.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.860]   [congregation laughing]
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.100]   But technically, you're right.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.140]   If you take that M out, it's the S word.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.600]   Don't say that, okay?
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.500]   And so we're talking to him about this,
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.140]   and we're trying to let him see that,
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.040]   hey, if you get your friends to say it,
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.440]   and all these words, and trying to talk to him.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.640]   And here's the part that I think we can all identify with.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.680]   I was telling him Sunday night,
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.240]   I'm like, Jake, when you lead your friends
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.220]   to say those words, that's just as bad
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.640]   and just as destructive as saying it.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.060]   And he just looked at me, and he just goes,
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.020]   I can't help it.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.320]   These words are just in my mind,
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.160]   and I just have to say them.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.460]   And there's a part of me that's like, I get that.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.500]   I think if we're honest, all of us would say we get that.
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.160]   That's the way it feels so often with these choices
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.000]   that we're facing every single day.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.640]   And this is the way that so many of us approach temptation.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.940]   We just feel like we're gonna fail.
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.240]   Like I can't help it.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.780]   These ideas are just in my mind.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.440]   The only thing I know how to do
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.440]   is to give in to these impulses.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.620]   And so I'm just like, I've always struggled with lust.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.320]   I'm always gonna struggle with it.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.460]   You know, Adam, I can't go 10 days
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.360]   without looking at pornography, let alone 10 years.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.460]   This is just who I am.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.920]   This is just what I'm gonna struggle with.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.760]   You know what, Adam?
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.060]   I've been struggling with anxiety since I was nine.
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.600]   It's just a part of who I am.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.860]   It's just a part of who I am.
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.200]   And I would just say,
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.840]   that's not what scripture tells us.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.680]   God is faithful.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.240]   He's faithful, and he will not let you,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.780]   not let me, not let Jake, not let Joshua,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:00.460]   not let anybody be tempted beyond what they can bear.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.000]   Some of us have seen these commercials for pickup trucks,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.220]   seen commercials for pickup trucks.
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.560]   Pickup trucks have these classes.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.800]   There's a one ton, a two ton, a three ton pickup truck.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.440]   And what that means, a one ton pickup truck
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.900]   means that that truck was designed
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.480]   to have a payload or a towing capacity of one ton,
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.080]   meaning you can put one ton of materials in that truck
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.720]   and that truck will be able to function normally and safely.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.380]   But if you put two tons in a one ton truck,
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.280]   it won't be able to function normally.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.660]   And so basically what Paul is telling us
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.760]   is that we're kind of similar to pickup trucks.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.020]   God knows if we're a one ton, a two ton,
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.100]   or a three ton pickup truck,
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.800]   he knows how much you and I can bear
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.660]   and still function within his will
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.600]   and still make the right choices.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.600]   And so what Jake is doing when I tell him,
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.540]   "No, no, no, listen, you're not defeated.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.180]   You're not defeated.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.500]   God is faithful.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.080]   Jake, he will not let you be tempted
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.340]   beyond what you can bear."
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.840]   What Jake is learning as a little eight year old
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.580]   is what a lot of us in this room have learned.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.320]   He's learning to exercise a muscle
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.520]   that he's gonna have to use for the rest of his life.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.920]   And that muscle is resisting temptation.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.320]   And understanding that you're not overwhelmed with this.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.820]   It's not, you're not just guaranteed to lose.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:18.160]   He's faithful.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.740]   He's there, it's not unbearable.
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.640]   And so this is comforting to us as we face our choices.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.000]   But it's also sobering guys,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.940]   because here's what this means.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.320]   This means that none of us,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.020]   none of us can ever pass the blame.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.820]   You can't pass the blame to anyone.
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:41.620]   If you're not forced to sin, if it's not unbearable,
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.460]   if temptation is not unbearable,
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.960]   then what that means is that you and I,
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.360]   we can't blame the culture.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.100]   We can't blame our friends.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.620]   We can't blame our parents.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.100]   We can't blame the way that people dress.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.860]   We can't blame the way that people act.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.140]   We can't blame our friends that are just,
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.000]   that's the way they are and this is what we do.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.540]   You cannot blame anybody for your choices.
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.540]   What that means for you and I
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.380]   is that every time we choose to do something
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.480]   that's contrary to God's best for our life,
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.520]   that's our choice.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.660]   That's our choice.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.680]   We weren't forced to do anything.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.620]   So temptation is unavoidable for all of us,
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.320]   but no temptation is unbearable for any of us.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.760]   It's not unbearable.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   And let's look at this last point that he makes here.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.060]   But when you are tempted,
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.160]   so no temptation's overtaking you
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.400]   except what's common to man.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.840]   God is faithful.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.100]   He not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.440]   And in this last part of verse 13,
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.300]   he says this, but when you are tempted,
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.800]   not if, when.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.040]   But when you are tempted,
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.280]   and look at this, this is the life hack.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.420]   He will also provide a way out
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.060]   so that you can endure.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:56.500]   So we see that temptation is unavoidable
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.720]   and that no temptation is unbearable.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.800]   And the third point I wanna make
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.160]   from this passage tonight is this,
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.000]   is that no temptation is unescapable.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.940]   You're never stuck.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.280]   You're never stuck.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.740]   Whatever situation you're facing,
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.840]   he has given us an amazing promise.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.580]   He's given us an amazing promise.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.520]   And this is what is so helpful for us
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.640]   is that whatever temptation we're facing,
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.880]   whatever choice that we're facing,
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.720]   there is always a way out
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.780]   so that we can choose the right path.
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.020]   There's always a way out
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.960]   so that we can choose following him.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.660]   We're never, ever, ever stuck.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.400]   We're never stuck.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.000]   So let me illustrate it this way.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.760]   Let's say you're sitting in here tonight
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.100]   and you know that the temptation that you face
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.840]   or the destructiveness that can come into your life
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.300]   a lot of times, let's say you're sitting here tonight,
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.400]   it's a Tuesday night,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.700]   and you know that the temptation
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.840]   that you struggle with is alcohol.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.180]   Abusing alcohol, giving into that,
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.520]   you like the way it makes you feel,
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.680]   like the way it makes you act,
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.940]   but if you really think about it,
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:59.160]   alcohol has really been a source of robbing you of life.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.320]   It's brought a lot of shame.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.560]   You've made some choices.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.620]   You've said some things.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.220]   You've done some things that you regret.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.860]   You know that your relationship with alcohol
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.300]   is not healthy right now and you wanna change it.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.860]   This is not who you wanna become.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.940]   It's something that you wanna change,
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.400]   but you're struggling.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.640]   So let's say tonight you're hearing this
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.840]   and you're going, great.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.040]   I've got this renewed.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.140]   I'm gonna fight this temptation against alcohol.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.380]   I'm gonna do this differently.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.980]   And so Tuesday night, you go home, you're all excited.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.620]   Tomorrow, Wednesday, you're still excited.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.780]   Thursday, you're still excited.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.380]   Friday, you're like, that's it.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.620]   This is gonna be a different weekend.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.780]   I'm not gonna go to work on Monday feeling bad.
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.820]   I'm not gonna wake up Sunday regretting what's happening.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.460]   I'm not gonna wake up Saturday regretting.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.020]   I have a new relationship with alcohol.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.200]   So the phone rings on a Friday night and it's your friends.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.540]   It's the same thing.
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.660]   They're getting ready to do the same thing
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.940]   that Friday night that they do every Friday night
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.440]   that you always do with them on Friday night
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.900]   is, hey, we're going out to the bars.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.900]   We're gonna go hit two, three, maybe four of them.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.280]   We want you to come along.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.040]   And you're sitting there and you're going, I don't know.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.540]   Like that's gonna be hard, but all right.
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.280]   No temptation sees me except what's common.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.240]   None of it's unbearable.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.680]   There's always a way out.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.120]   I wanna be with my friends.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.260]   I got nothing else to do on Friday night, so I'm gonna go.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.920]   So you go over there, you meet your friends
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.380]   at the first bar.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.300]   They sit down, they start ordering drinks.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.360]   You are tempted by it, but you order a Dr. Pepper.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.640]   You start drinking the Dr. Pepper.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.860]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.900]   Everybody's excited.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.740]   You're in a good mood.
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.580]   Everybody's laughing.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.700]   You're talking about your week.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.480]   You're making fun of the Oscars for that whole snafu.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.380]   It's just everybody's light.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.840]   You're having a good time, all right?
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.980]   So you go through, your friends have two or three drinks.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.240]   They're like, all right, we wanna go to the second bar.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.120]   Let's go to the second bar.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.660]   And you're like, well, I made it through the first bar.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.020]   I bet I can make it through the second bar.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.420]   And plus I'm having fun hanging out with them.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.300]   So now you go the second bar with them.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.520]   They order another round of drinks.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.800]   They won, another round goes down, another round goes down.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.340]   And now, now it's not really as much fun anymore.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.840]   Now they're just getting loud.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.560]   They're getting bold.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.840]   They're talking about what a fool their boss is
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.640]   and what they would do if they ran the company
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.160]   and whatever business they're gonna start.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.020]   So there's a lot of boldness that's starting to come out.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.440]   But you just, you keep pounding Dr. Peppers.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.320]   You're feeling good.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.320]   You're like, all right, this is different.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.560]   They get bored with the second bar.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.880]   They're like, we're going to a third bar.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.440]   And you're looking at your watch and you're just like,
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.560]   well, I've had 17 Dr. Peppers.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.480]   I'm not sleeping.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:14.120]   These are my friends.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.260]   All right, let's go to the third bar.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.320]   So now you go to the third bar, they order more drinks.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.920]   You get another Dr. Pepper.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.240]   Now their tune changes a little bit.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.600]   You know, they were happy and then they were bold
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.820]   and now they're sad.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.200]   They're getting sentimental.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.400]   They're telling you, I love you.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.120]   You're like always my best.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.360]   Two of your friends are crying, you know.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.200]   One is calling the guy that she's broken up with nine times
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.320]   and you know, it was my fault and all that kind of stuff.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.160]   But you're still drinking Dr. Peppers.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.960]   They want to go to the fourth bar.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.600]   Like, hey, I've been doing fine.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   This is good.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.360]   So you go to the fourth bar.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.800]   They order more drinks.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.320]   So they were happy and then they were bold.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.620]   And they were sad and emotional.
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.000]   At the fourth bar, something happens
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.560]   because now they're just angry.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.280]   They're angry and now they're angry with you.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.920]   They realize that you've been drinking Dr. Peppers all night
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.440]   and they're not okay with that.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.440]   They start asking you questions.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.280]   Why are you drinking Dr. Pepper?
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.000]   You better than us?
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.600]   Are you better than us?
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.880]   Like, this is what we do, right?
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.720]   We're friends.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.540]   This is what we do.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.260]   We go out and we drink and we do this.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.000]   And now you're drinking Dr. Pepper.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.520]   Like, why are you messing with what we got?
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.080]   So now they're starting to get angry
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.280]   and then they get you cornered
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.520]   'cause you're sitting in a booth
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.080]   and you're over there in the corner
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.520]   and they've got you cornered.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.640]   And you're wondering, oh no, I don't know.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.560]   I haven't tried.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.200]   I don't know what's gonna happen right now
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.400]   because then what happens is they order a pitcher
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.920]   and they put it right in front of you.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.360]   Pitcher a beer right in front of you.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.680]   They get a clean glass.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.000]   They set it right in front of you
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.120]   and all of them are looking at you and they go, drink.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.800]   You're drinking that.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.040]   You're drinking that.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.360]   You're not getting out of this booth until you drink that.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.800]   And it looks like a hopeless situation.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.720]   But God is faithful
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.560]   and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.560]   And when you are tempted, he will provide a way out.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.360]   There's a way out of that situation.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.080]   And the way out of it is to do this.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.960]   You take that glass and you take that pitcher
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.520]   and you pour some beer in that glass.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.200]   And you say, guys, let's have a toast.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.520]   And you raise that glass and you say,
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.920]   let's toast to a great night 'cause I'm about to go home.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.720]   And you take that glass of beer and you turn
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.360]   and you throw it as hard as you can against that wall.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.160]   And I mean, I want like, there's beer going everywhere
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.760]   and there's glass going everywhere.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.440]   And you take that pitcher
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.960]   and you smash that against the wall
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.720]   because guess what happens when you do that?
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:00.040]   The bouncer's gonna come over and he's gonna rescue you.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.480]   And he's gonna take you and throw you out.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:11.600]   And you're gonna call Uber and you're gonna go home.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.440]   And you won.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:19.840]   Now let's be honest.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.640]   That's a way out.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:29.600]   But that's like a really tiny, tiny door to go through.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.960]   There were other ways out that night, right?
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.920]   There was a little bit bigger door
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.800]   before you walked into the fourth bar.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   The door was a little bit bigger
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.640]   before you walked into the third one.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.160]   It was a little bit bigger
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.600]   before you walked into the second one.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.080]   It was pretty big size
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.120]   before you walked into the first bar with them.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.680]   But I'm telling you what, the door, the way out,
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.320]   the door that was just massive
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.680]   that you could just drive a Mack truck through.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.200]   The biggest door was when they called you.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.800]   And they said, we're going out
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.240]   and we're gonna do the exact same thing we always do.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.640]   That was the big door.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.280]   And so some of you may be sitting there going,
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.120]   so what, Adam, are you telling me
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.400]   that I shouldn't go to the bars anymore?
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.680]   I don't know, maybe.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.720]   If your relationship with alcohol is unhealthy,
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.440]   if it's never just one drink for you
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.920]   and it's a source of shame and guilt in your life
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.280]   and you have a bad relationship with it,
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.120]   then yeah, guess what?
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.880]   You probably shouldn't go to the bars anymore.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.080]   That's probably gonna be something
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.600]   that's getting in the way of you becoming the person
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.680]   that you wanna become.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.800]   Well, Adam, so if you're telling me
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.720]   not to go to the bars anymore,
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.640]   you're telling me I need new friends?
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.000]   Probably, maybe.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.040]   'Cause if those friends think
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.920]   that's the only thing you have in common
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.160]   and they don't care that you wanna break free
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.040]   from being enslaved to that,
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.920]   and they don't see that
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.760]   and they just think that,
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.480]   oh, they're loving you by being around you
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.240]   and they don't see or want what's best for you,
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.080]   then guess what?
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.040]   You probably need some new friends.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.040]   So they're going, so what?
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.000]   It's like following Jesus, I just gotta,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.160]   like he's gonna start messing
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.560]   with all this stuff in my life?
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.760]   Yeah, yes.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:18.920]   But here's the deal is I'm willing to bet
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.200]   he's gonna mess with all the stuff
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.160]   that you want changed in your life.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.320]   It's all that stuff that you know
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.440]   is in the way of you becoming the person
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.720]   that it is that you wanna become.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.800]   It's that stuff that you feel enslaved by.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.440]   When you're alone, when you're alone
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.520]   and you're looking at yourself in the mirror,
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.440]   you know he's gonna mess with all the stuff
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.120]   that you want out of your life anyway.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.760]   You may be sitting there going,
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.280]   Adam, that's nobody's story, nobody does that.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.120]   Really?
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.400]   It's mine.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.320]   It's my story.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.080]   I didn't follow Jesus for years
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.800]   and I wish it was because I had this intellectual objection
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.360]   to whether or not he was really rose from the dead
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.160]   or if the Bible could be trusted
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.840]   or something that sounded intellectual or good like that.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.320]   No, no, no.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.080]   The reason I didn't follow Jesus for years
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.440]   after somebody shared the gospel with me
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.640]   is because I just wanted friends, social reasons.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.360]   I was just afraid.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.360]   I couldn't imagine what life with him,
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.960]   the cost seemed too great.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.080]   But what's amazing is I know my story.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.880]   I'm not alone.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.600]   I know there are hundreds, if not over a thousand,
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.800]   very similar stories.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.760]   And we all have the exact same message, which is this.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.680]   Is that the cost?
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.440]   Yes, is there a cost of following Jesus?
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.000]   Yes, there's a cost of following Jesus.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.520]   But it is infinitely less expensive
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.160]   than the cost of not following Jesus.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:50.000]   So temptation is unavoidable.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.000]   No temptation is unbearable
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.240]   and no temptation is unescapable.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.320]   He will always provide a way out.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.560]   So it's just, my ask tonight is simple.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.280]   If you're in the room tonight
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.260]   and you are one of those who claim
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.300]   to be a follower of Jesus, the life hack,
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.140]   the life hack is this.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.580]   The life hack is to start looking for the big doors.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:19.400]   Wake up tomorrow morning
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.080]   and just go, all right, Lord,
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.800]   I know today I'm gonna face choices.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.640]   I know today there's gonna be temptations.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.160]   I know today my heart is gonna wanna go
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.520]   in a direction that is contrary to your best.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.260]   But I just wanna remind myself of the truth, Lord,
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.360]   that nothing will overtake me today
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.720]   except what's common to man.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.960]   The battle is out there and I'm not unique.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.920]   And I know that no matter what I face today,
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.240]   you are faithful.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.080]   You are faithful
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.520]   and I will not be tempted beyond what I can bear.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.020]   And Lord, I know that no matter what,
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.360]   when I'm tempted, that you are gonna find
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.560]   or provide a way out.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.640]   And so Lord, help me see the big doors
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.560]   'cause Lord, I'm done making a living
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.040]   climbing through small doors
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.600]   and climbing through small windows.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.640]   I've got scars and pain and that's just, that's hard.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.440]   I don't wanna do that anymore, Lord.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.360]   I wanna go through the big doors
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.480]   and so you help me tonight.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.620]   And so if you're following Jesus,
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.800]   that's my ask for you tonight,
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.520]   my encouragement, my challenge for you tonight
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.880]   is to start looking for the big doors.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.920]   And if you're in the room tonight
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.840]   and you would not claim to be a follower of Jesus,
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.960]   then my ask is a little different.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.080]   My ask for you is this,
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.040]   is to consider walking through the door.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.680]   And that door is Jesus.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.320]   So Jesus in John chapter nine,
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.040]   or excuse me, chapter 10, verses nine and 10,
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:39.880]   this is what he says.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.080]   He says, "I'm the gate, I'm the door.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.520]   I'm the gate, whoever enters through me will be saved.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.240]   They will come in and they will go out
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   and they will find pasture.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.220]   The thief comes only to kill, steal and destroy,
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:58.680]   but I have come that you may have life
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.040]   and have it to the full."
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.920]   So if you're in the room tonight
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.040]   and you're thinking about who Jesus is
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.240]   and contemplating who God is,
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.700]   I just wanna be a friend and I just wanna tell you
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.400]   that you have done things like we have all done things
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.120]   that are contrary to God's best for our life.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.040]   And these decisions, these attitudes,
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.560]   these actions or these thoughts,
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.480]   these things that we've done,
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.940]   they're not just mistakes.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.120]   They're not just learning experiences.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.080]   Scripture would say they're called sin
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.200]   and they carry an eternal consequence,
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.640]   meaning we are separated from God eternally.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.900]   And there's no amount of good behavior
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.200]   that we could ever do to bridge that gap
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.540]   and bring that relationship back between us and God.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.860]   We are stuck and we need a rescuer.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.720]   And that rescuer is Jesus.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.240]   Jesus says he's the door.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.600]   If you want to be in a relationship with God,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.720]   you've gotta walk through him.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.240]   You've gotta trust him.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.280]   You've gotta recognize that you are a sinner
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.120]   in need of a savior and that savior is Jesus Christ.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.800]   And all you do is you just receive the gift,
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.820]   the gift that Jesus offers, which is salvation,
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.720]   the forgiveness of your sins.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.800]   You just receive that gift
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.720]   and you just walk through the door.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.840]   You just say, "Lord, I'm a sinner.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.980]   I'm in need of a savior.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.540]   I recognize I've done things
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.160]   that have separated me from you.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.080]   And I believe that you love me so much
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.160]   that you sent Jesus to take the punishment for my sins,
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.720]   to take the payment for my sins.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.580]   And I wanna trust in you."
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.800]   And there's a cost.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.400]   There's a cost to following him.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.700]   But it just looks so minuscule
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.660]   compared to the cost of not following him.
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.180]   Come and know this Jesus.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.980]   Let's pray.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.520]   God, we just thank you for your word.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.280]   (pages rustling)
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.920]   We thank you that you love us, Lord.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.120]   We thank you that you haven't left us alone.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:55.440]   We thank you God that even though you know
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.760]   that we are so prone to just wander
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.800]   and we wanna go so many different directions
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.840]   and we wanna choose things
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.560]   that we know are not gonna bring us life,
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.840]   but you, you are faithful.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.240]   And so we just declare that tonight, Lord,
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.280]   that you're faithful.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.640]   And we praise you God in your grace and mercy
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   that you will not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.560]   Yeah, we praise you that no matter what situation
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.120]   in life we face, you provide a way out.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.940]   And so I ask for my brothers and sisters
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.600]   and myself in this room tonight,
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:30.000]   God, I ask that you will help us to see those big doors,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.200]   that we will stop just trying to walk up to the edge
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.480]   and see how far we can make it.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.600]   We've got scars, Lord.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.720]   We know that doesn't work.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.400]   And so we need your grace and your mercy
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.640]   to help us walk through the big doors.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.000]   And my friends in the room tonight, Lord,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.120]   that don't know you, I pray they'll walk through the door
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.480]   and they'll come to know you, Jesus.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.320]   And so I pray, Lord, that you will open their eyes.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.520]   And we ask this in the name of Christ.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.520]   Thank you.
