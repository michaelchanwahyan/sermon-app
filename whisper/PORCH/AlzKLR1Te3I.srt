00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,520
 [music]

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,560
 Here we go.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,600
 Let's go, Porch.

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,280
 Come on.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,880
 Hey, I want to welcome you in this place.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,000
 And then finally, my friends in this room, let's go, Dallas.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,080
 Come on.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:58,360
 Our team, our Porch staff team took to the Porch social Instagram stories

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
 yesterday.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
 There we go.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,880
 And I don't know if you saw it, but we proposed some hot topics.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,200
 And anybody see that?

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
 Yeah? Okay.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
 Oh, wow. Okay.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
 Yeah.

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
 So, we just proposed some questions, some hot topics, and we just basically said,

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,080
 "Hey, is blank a sin?

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,320
 Is blank a sin?"

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,800
 And we just filled the blank in with a lot of different hot topics in our culture.

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,360
 And so, man, we got a lot of responses.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,040
 Like, y'all were vocal.

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,520
 Like, there's some pastors in this room now.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,800
 Like, there's some people, and I love it.

31
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,680
 Like, man, it was overwhelming, but it was good.

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,760
 Like, we got a bunch of different responses, yes, no, well, it just depends,

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,200
 the timing, what's involved, a lot of nuance, right?

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,240
 And so, we just thought, "Hey, what if we opened up and just let you guys speak,

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,600
 right?

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,440
 Like, you guys just share what you think is a sin."

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,400
 We talked about this idea of gray areas, like, you know, the gray areas of,

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,760
 like, where the Bible might not be as explicit, is this a sin or not?

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,040
 And so, we just said, "Hey, what if we just propose some questions tonight,

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,200
 maybe run back to those Instagram stories, and just propose some questions for you to

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,320
 be able to answer?"

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,600
 So, this is what we're going to do, okay?

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,000
 It's like, this is no judgment, judgment-free zone, okay?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,960
 Like, I know some of you, like, you're just waiting.

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,080
 Like, "I cannot believe you think that's a sin.

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
 Oh, my gosh.

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,600
 I'm ready right now.

48
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,520
 I'm ready to strike you.

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
 Wait, we need to have a conversation.

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,600
 We need to think."

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,000
 And it ain't none of that, okay?

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,760
 So, we need 100% audience participation.

53
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,040
 So, I'm going to propose some questions, and this is between you and God.

54
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,800
 You hear me?

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,920
 You and God, and, hey, don't be looking around.

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,200
 Don't be looking around at who is a sin or not.

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,000
 Like, I just want you to raise your hand.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,640
 Some of you are getting nervous right now.

59
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,680
 You're like, "Oh, what's going on?"

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,840
 Like, I just want you to raise your hand if you think it's a sin, or I want you to

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,280
 raise your hand if you don't think it's a sin.

62
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,200
 So, I will prompt you when to raise your hand and when not to, okay?

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,040
 So, here we go.

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,200
 Let's just have some fun in here.

65
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,160
 I'm going to throw out a question, and you're going to raise your hand if it's a

66
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,840
 sin or if it's not a sin.

67
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,400
 Okay, here we go.

68
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,880
 Y'all ready?

69
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,200
 Hey, looking straight at me.

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,040
 Quit looking at each other.

71
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,280
 Y'all, hey, come on.

72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,960
 Y'all terrible.

73
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,360
 All right, here we go.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,160
 Is it a sin for a Christian to go to a bar and drink?

75
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,360
 Raise your hand.

76
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,960
 Is it a sin for a Christian to go to a bar and drink?

77
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,440
 Okay, we got a few hands.

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,720
 Even if it causes someone to stumble?

79
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,040
 Oh, we got a few more hands.

80
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,240
 What about this?

81
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,040
 Hey, is it a Christian...

82
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,440
 Excuse me.

83
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:47,080
 Is it a sin for a Christian not to go to a bar and drink?

84
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,880
 I duped you.

85
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,200
 That was a joke.

86
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,240
 That was a joke.

87
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,080
 Okay, so is it a sin for a Christian to go to a bar and drink?

88
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,880
 Raise your hand.

89
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,400
 Okay, cool.

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,920
 All right, let's get a little bit more, a little bit more hot.

91
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,760
 Is it a sin for a Christian female to wear a bikini?

92
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
 Raise your hand.

93
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,760
 [laughing]

94
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 And all the guys are like...

95
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
 [laughing]

96
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,760
 Not me, not me, bro.

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,760
 [laughing]

98
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,760
 Oh, man.

99
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,760
 Is it a sin for a guy to make a shirtless thirst trap video on TikTok?

100
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,760
 Oh, oh.

101
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
 And all the ladies done outed you.

102
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,760
 [laughing]

103
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,760
 Is it a sin just for a guy to make a video shirtless?

104
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
 [laughing]

105
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
 Hey, Porch Live, y'all better be playing along too.

106
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,760
 I'm watching.

107
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
 All right, number four.

108
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,760
 Is it a sin to spend the night at your girlfriend/boyfriend's house?

109
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,760
 Is it a sin to spend the night at your girlfriend/boyfriend's house?

110
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
 Raise your hand.

111
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,760
 Ah, someone said in the same bed.

112
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
 I don't know, in the same bed?

113
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,760
 Is it a sin to spend the night at your girlfriend/boyfriend's house in the same bed?

114
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
 Raise your hand.

115
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,760
 Okay, okay.

116
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,760
 Oh, man, we got some work to do.

117
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,760
 I'm playing, I'm playing.

118
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
 All right, here we go, number five.

119
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,760
 Is it a sin to smoke weed in states where it's legal?

120
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
 Is it a sin, raise your hand.

121
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,760
 Is it a sin to smoke weed in states where it's legal?

122
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,760
 Okay, we got a few more hands, okay.

123
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,760
 This question was actually 50/50.

124
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
 About 50% said, "No, man, it's not a sin."

125
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
 50% said, "Oh, it's a sin."

126
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,760
 All right, how about two more?

127
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,760
 Is it a sin to listen to explicit music?

128
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
 Raise your hand.

129
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,760
 Okay, Porch Live, okay.

130
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,760
 Lastly, is it a sin, raise your hand, is it a sin to make out with your boyfriend/girlfriend?

131
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
 Raise your hand.

132
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,760
 Okay, and all the hands went.

133
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,760
 Oh, man, this is going to be a fun night.

134
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,760
 All right, so for example, let me just give you some stats.

135
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
 Let me give you some percentages.

136
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,760
 For example, when it comes to sleeping with your boyfriend/girlfriend's house, 83% --

137
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
 "No, it's not a sin."

138
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,760
 17% said it was.

139
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:37,760
 89% said it wasn't a sin for you to drink alcohol at a bar, while 11% said it was a sin.

140
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,760
 And again, let me just say it if you missed it, 50/50.

141
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,760
 50% said it's a sin to smoke weed even in states that illegalize it.

142
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,760
 50% says, "No, man, it's not a sin."

143
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,760
 All right, so you guys are divided down the room on just that one topic, and everyone else is like,

144
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,760
 "No, it's not a sin on all the others pretty much."

145
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
 All right, so you got that?

146
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,760
 Here's some other gray areas that y'all propose.

147
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,760
 Let me just pull up the gram and scroll through some.

148
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
 All right, y'all ready for this?

149
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,760
 So is it a sin, and then I'm going to fill in the blank.

150
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
 Getting a tattoo.

151
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,760
 Sleeping in the same bed with your significant other but not having sex.

152
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,760
 Moving in together after engagement but living in separate rooms.

153
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,760
 That just sounds terrible.

154
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
 Oh, my gosh.

155
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:35,760
 I mean, I know you're trying to save money or something, but hey, call your boy up and we can figure something else out.

156
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
 Living with the opposite gender.

157
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,760
 Is it a sin to masturbate without porn?

158
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
 We getting real tonight.

159
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,760
 Is it a sin to speed in traffic?

160
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
 And everybody just look for the exit.

161
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,760
 Everyone's just like, "Ah."

162
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
 A few more, man.

163
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
 I'm just going to run quickly.

164
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:09,760
 Is it a sin to cuss, have plastic surgery, vape, buying expensive things, desiring success, getting her hair did?

165
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,760
 Not to get her hair done.

166
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,760
 To not tithe, being tipsy, dancing with and kissing strangers, bumping and grinding.

167
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,760
 Okay, I mean.

168
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:29,760
 Overeating, manifesting, gambling, and working out to secular music.

169
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,760
 Man, we got some work to do.

170
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,760
 Hey, what I love about this, I love that we started here tonight.

171
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
 Like, I love the fact that we're talking about this.

172
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,760
 Listen, it's good that we're talking about these things because tonight we want to dive into what we call gray areas.

173
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
 You know those things in life that aren't always black and white?

174
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
 Like, here's the deal.

175
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,760
 For some of you, the gray areas is a sin.

176
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,760
 But for others of you, like, real talk.

177
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,760
 Like, gray areas, like the things that we're going to propose tonight, it's not a sin for you.

178
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
 Like, the classic example is alcohol.

179
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
 Let's just go there for a second.

180
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
 The classic example is alcohol.

181
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:14,760
 It's 100% clear from God's word, that's where we're going to be tonight, it's 100% clear that getting drunk is a sin.

182
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,760
 Like, Ephesians 5.18 says this, "And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery."

183
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
 In other words, that's sin.

184
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
 "But be filled with the Spirit."

185
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:32,760
 But it's also clear that the Bible doesn't say anything about you not being able to drink, to have a drink.

186
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
 Like, that's also clear.

187
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
 Like, we have freedom to drink moderately.

188
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:43,760
 But there's times, and I'll share even in my life later on in the message, there's times when it might not even be good for you to have a drink,

189
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,760
 because that one drink is actually going to lead you to intoxication, to drunkenness.

190
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:56,760
 And so, you know, it just depends on situation, people involved, and others would just say, "Hey, that's a gray area."

191
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:08,760
 So my aim tonight, you know, is really, even in the midst of gray areas like alcohol, I believe that the Bible is really, really clear on how we navigate these gray areas.

192
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,760
 And we're going to be in the book of 1 Corinthians tonight, pulling up to chapter 6, we'll be in 6, 8, and 10.

193
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,760
 If you have a copy of God's word, you can open it there.

194
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,760
 If you don't have a copy of God's word, every week, a physical copy, we want to give this as our gift to you.

195
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,760
 Stop by the welcome desk on your way out in the town center and just say, "Hey, I would love to have a Bible," and that's just our gift to you.

196
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,760
 So we're going to be in 1 Corinthians chapter 6, 8, and 10 tonight.

197
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,760
 And I want to start out by just saying this up top.

198
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
 Like, we're going to dive into the Bible.

199
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
 Like, this is our source.

200
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,760
 Like, remember in class, like the teacher, English teacher would say, "Hey, cite your source."

201
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,760
 Like, we're going to cite our source tonight, because our source is the Bible.

202
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:58,760
 And so I hear a lot of times people say, "Well, JP said this," or "TA said this," or "This person said this," and that's not necessarily a bad thing, because I believe in those men.

203
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 Like, they're awesome.

204
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,760
 Like, man, those men disciple me, walk with me, help me become more of God's man.

205
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:12,760
 But if you're citing people more than you're citing God and his word, that could be problematic for you.

206
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,760
 And so I think sometimes we have a tendency just to follow mere men, and they're human, too.

207
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
 They're not going to get it right 100% of the time.

208
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,760
 And so they would say, "Hey, point people back to my word.

209
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
 Point people back to God's word."

210
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
 And so that's where we're going to be tonight.

211
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
 We're going to be in God's word.

212
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
 And so let me say this as well.

213
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,760
 I believe that the Bible clearly defines right and wrong on many of life's issues.

214
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 Like, you can go to Exodus 20.

215
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
 That's where you see the Ten Commandments.

216
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,760
 Matthew 5, you see one of the greatest sermons that Jesus --

217
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
 I would just say the greatest sermon that Jesus ever preached was the Sermon on the Mount,

218
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,760
 where he addresses lust, adultery, murder, hatred in one's heart.

219
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
 We see in Exodus 20, there's the Ten Commandments.

220
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,760
 You know, that's when I covet, lie, steal.

221
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,760
 You know, just these issues that are very, very black and white.

222
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,760
 And so we believe that, hey, you know, Scripture is clear on a lot of things.

223
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,760
 We also believe, and I'm guilty of this, that there's something in all of our hearts.

224
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,760
 If you were here last week, JP just said, "Hey, sin is in all of our hearts."

225
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,760
 And the more we feed it, the more we're going to be drawn to those things.

226
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,760
 I also believe, and I'm guilty of this, that I have a tendency to manipulate, bend, twist the truth,

227
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,760
 even to this day with some issues.

228
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,760
 And it's most of the issues that I struggle with, the sin that I struggle with,

229
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,760
 whether that be anger or, you know, lust, not bouncing my eyes when I see someone.

230
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,760
 Like, I just, there's something in me that's like, "Oh, you know, just one look, you know, I see, it's okay."

231
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,760
 Just to want to manipulate and bend and not just be straight up with what God's Word says.

232
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,760
 And I think the same if you're true to yourself,

233
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,760
 if you really would examine your own heart tonight, you'd be like, "Yeah, I think that's in me as well."

234
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,760
 One more thing before we dive in, I want to caution us because I think there's a tendency in us all

235
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,760
 to fall in one or two camps.

236
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,760
 The first camp we fall into as we're looking at gray areas is the camp of legalism.

237
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,760
 And so, like, this was the Pharisees, these were the Sadducees of Jesus' day, and he called them out.

238
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,760
 The word legalism is just this, where you take God's Word and not only do you obey the command,

239
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,760
 but then you add more commands to that command.

240
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,760
 Like, you just, you start adding more rules to the rules that God's given you.

241
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
 And sometimes that's good, like, I don't want to fault anyone.

242
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,760
 If you're here, you're like, "Yeah, I do that because I want to get as far away from the sin as possible

243
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,760
 so it doesn't hook me," right?

244
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,760
 But if we had to be honest tonight, some of us, we like adding more rules

245
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,760
 because we like looking down at people that don't do the things that we do.

246
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,760
 And so, we are quick to judge other people.

247
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,760
 Like, we look at people and we're like, "Well, they don't drink what I drink.

248
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
 They don't wear what I wear.

249
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,760
 They don't listen to the music that I listen to."

250
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,760
 And so, we just cast judgment on them.

251
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:21,760
 And that can be very legalistic, where you just add more rules because, hey, you struggle with something,

252
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,760
 they might not struggle with that thing, and so what they're entertaining, it doesn't hook them.

253
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,760
 But what you might entertain would hook you back to an unhealthy place.

254
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:39,760
 And instead of just pulling up a seat at the table and just saying, "Hey, help me understand how you got there,

255
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
 how you got there to make that decision."

256
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:49,760
 Like, what if this room, just this room right here, we let out with curiosity versus condemnation?

257
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,760
 We weren't just curious to like, "Oh, I'm curious to know why you did that thing

258
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,760
 or why you made that decision or why you wear that, and as soon as I hear why you did that,

259
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
 I'm going to condemn you."

260
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,760
 We were just curious, like, "Help me understand how you got there."

261
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,760
 Like, truly, we had that as a posture of our heart.

262
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,760
 Like, I think it would go a lot further with people to understand how they got there.

263
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,760
 And I think we just don't do that enough, and it grieves me, especially us Christians in the room,

264
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,760
 where we're just quick to cast stones at people because they don't look like we look.

265
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,760
 They might not act like we act.

266
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,760
 They might not do the things that we do.

267
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:42,760
 I think the other camp, if we're not careful, we will have a tendency to bend to what I would call is licentiousness.

268
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,760
 It's this idea that we swing the pendulum to the other side, and what the Bible calls sin,

269
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,760
 we just call it a gray area.

270
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
 This is where we turn the grace of God into licentiousness.

271
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,760
 This is where you believe the more you sin, the more you allow God to shower you with his grace,

272
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,760
 twisting what grace really is.

273
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,760
 You're like, "Hey, man, you know, I'm going to do this thing.

274
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
 It's my thing.

275
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
 You know, you have a thing.

276
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
 I have a thing.

277
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,760
 It's my thing, but, you know, God's grace is going to cover me."

278
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
 And Paul says something to that in Romans 6.

279
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,760
 He says, "Hey, should you continue to sin so that grace may abound?"

280
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
 And he says, "By no means.

281
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,760
 By no means should you do that."

282
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,760
 But some of us, we have a tendency of what the Bible would call black and white,

283
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
 we would say, "No, it's gray."

284
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
 And that grieves me.

285
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,760
 That grieves me because some of us, man, we are the only Bible that some people will ever read.

286
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:49,760
 By the way you live your life, by the way you talk, by the way you respond to criticism and gossip,

287
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,760
 sometimes that's the only Bible that people will ever read.

288
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:00,760
 And we miss it because we think we're owed that response.

289
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,760
 And so I would say another temptation will always be to give a rule instead of proposing questions

290
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,760
 because that's easier.

291
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,760
 I want to propose some questions for you to ask.

292
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,760
 Like some of you are going to be really, really upset with me tonight because you're like,

293
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,760
 "You didn't give me the answer, bro."

294
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,760
 And I'm like, "I know, but I'm giving you some questions to ask so that it would lead you back to the heart of God."

295
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
 Like Jesus didn't come just to give you rules.

296
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
 He came to give you a relationship.

297
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,760
 And I'm going to propose a few questions tonight that will hopefully lead you back to a relationship with him.

298
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,760
 If I just give you a rule, then you just get to leave here and go obey the rule.

299
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,760
 And you probably won't obey the rule.

300
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:51,760
 And so I want to just propose some questions instead of saying, "Hey, never have a sip of alcohol.

301
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,760
 Wear turtlenecks and baggy pants for the rest of your life."

302
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
 Right?

303
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,760
 Like that would be weird, bro.

304
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,760
 You know, another one would be never kiss in a dating relationship.

305
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,760
 Only listen to Christian worship music.

306
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
 Right?

307
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,760
 Like that's not leading you to wrestle with the heart of God.

308
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,760
 And then I would say, secondly, that's not leading you back to God's people, what we call community here.

309
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,760
 I preached a few weeks ago, what is biblical community, finding people that you can run with.

310
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,760
 I have two men down here, down front, that I run with every single week, man.

311
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
 They know me and I know them.

312
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,760
 And I propose these questions to them when there's issues or there's decisions that I'm making.

313
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,760
 And they're like, "Hey, based on what I know of you, bro, that's really good.

314
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
 I think you should do it.

315
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,760
 Based on what I know of you, I don't think you should."

316
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
 So here we go.

317
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
 First Corinthians, chapter 6.

318
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
 Let me give you a little bit of context.

319
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:59,760
 When you read First Corinthians, you will find a culture and a group of people who are asking similar kinds of questions in their day surrounding faith and culture.

320
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,760
 Questions like, "Is it okay to drink alcohol?

321
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,760
 Is it a sin for women to wear certain clothes/jewelry?

322
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,760
 Can I eat meat sacrificed to idols?"

323
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,760
 We'll get there.

324
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,760
 "Paul has been called by God to speak God's Word 2,000 plus years ago."

325
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:28,760
 And I believe that we're going to pull up to a few texts tonight that is still as relevant as it was back then in 2023.

326
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
 Right here at the porch.

327
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
 So buckle up.

328
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
 Here we go.

329
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:40,760
 "In any situation, time, place, event, activity, task, action, whatever it is, ask yourself these four questions."

330
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
 Here we go.

331
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
 Question number one.

332
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,760
 "Is it helpful physically, mentally, and spiritually?"

333
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
 Is it helpful physically, mentally, and spiritually?

334
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
 Where do I get this from?

335
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,760
 First Corinthians 6.12, the first part of the verse.

336
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,760
 "God is saying through Paul, 'All things are lawful for me.'"

337
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
 So, hey, I can do all things.

338
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
 They're lawful.

339
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
 They're right.

340
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,760
 But not all things are helpful.

341
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,760
 Some of your translations might say beneficial, good for you.

342
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:23,760
 And so Paul is saying, "Hey, is what I'm about to do, is this going to be helpful physically, mentally, and spiritually in my relationship with Jesus?"

343
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,760
 Okay, so I'm going to run through these questions, and then we're going to put some application to it.

344
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
 Question number two.

345
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,760
 Same verse, but second half of it.

346
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
 Question two says this.

347
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,760
 "Does it bring me under its power?"

348
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
 Does it bring me under its power?

349
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
 First Corinthians 6.12, second part of it, says this.

350
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
 "All things are lawful for me."

351
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,760
 Paul's like, "Yeah, I can do all things, but I will not be dominated by anything."

352
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
 In other words, I'm not going to be mastered by anything.

353
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,760
 I'm not going to be a slave to this thing.

354
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,760
 "Is it going to hook me?" he's saying.

355
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,760
 "Is it going to take me out?"

356
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:11,760
 Is what I'm about to do, am I going to fall more in love with that than Christ himself?

357
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,760
 Anything we can't give up owns us, and now it's just become an idol in our life.

358
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
 You understand that?

359
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,760
 Anything that I can't give up, like think about it.

360
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:32,760
 Anything I can't give up, my car, my house, my wife for the pass away, my kids, like it owns me.

361
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,760
 Like I might have just put them on the pedestal of my worship.

362
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
 Like that's tough.

363
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,760
 Like my wife and I, man, we have questions, or we propose questions to each other.

364
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:49,760
 We have discussions around what would happen, because we don't want to ultimately be hooked to a point of, man, that could happen.

365
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:59,760
 We live in a broken world, and hey, but we've read the rest of the book, so we have hope.

366
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,760
 And so anything that I can't give up ultimately is an idol in my life and in your life.

367
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,760
 So hey, ask the question, "Is it going to dominate my life?

368
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
 Does it bring me under its power?"

369
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,760
 Question number three, "Does it hurt others?"

370
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,760
 1 Corinthians 8, starting in verse 8, and we'll just run through to 13.

371
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 Paul says this, "It's true that we can't win God's approval by what we eat.

372
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,760
 We don't lose anything if we don't eat it, and we don't gain anything if we do."

373
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,760
 So basically the context of this passage is meat sacrifice to idols.

374
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,760
 Paul's like, "Hey, man, there's only one true God.

375
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,760
 Like these, you know, the meat that they're sacrificing to these guys, like it doesn't really matter because they're not real gods.

376
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
 Only one God, but I get it.

377
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,760
 You know, if it's going to cause my brother to stumble, then I won't eat meat again."

378
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,760
 You're about to hear that in this text.

379
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:03,760
 He says in verse 9, "But you must be careful so that your freedom does not cause others with a weaker conscience to stumble.

380
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 For if others see you with superior knowledge eating in the temple of an idol,

381
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,760
 won't they be encouraged to violate their conscience by eating food that has been offered to an idol?

382
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,760
 So because of your superior knowledge, a weak believer for whom Christ died will be destroyed."

383
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,760
 Verse 12, "And when you sin against other believers by encouraging them to do something they believe is wrong,

384
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,760
 you are sinning against Christ." Wow.

385
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
 That's a big statement.

386
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:42,760
 And then verse 13, "So if what I eat causes another believer to sin, I will never eat meat again as long as I live.

387
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,760
 For I don't want to cause another believer to stumble."

388
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,760
 It's all in the name of, "Hey, will this hurt my fellow brother?

389
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
 Or will this hurt my fellow sister?"

390
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,760
 One that maybe is weaker in their conscience.

391
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:01,760
 They just maybe have come to Christ and they see you out doing something that maybe is confusing, whatever the case may be.

392
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,760
 Paul is just saying, "Hey, give it up."

393
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:11,760
 Because ultimately I want to win my brother or sister and I want them to be spurred on in their relationship with Christ.

394
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,760
 Number four, does it glorify God?

395
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
 Does it glorify God?

396
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,760
 First Corinthians 10.31 and 33.

397
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,760
 "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.

398
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,760
 Don't give offense to Jews or Gentiles or the church of God.

399
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,760
 I too try to please everyone in everything I do."

400
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,760
 It's not this type of people pleasing that we think when we read that.

401
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,760
 It's like, no, because even Galatians 1.10 says, "Am I trying to win the approval of others or of Christ?"

402
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,760
 If I was trying to win the approval of others, then I'd never be a servant of Christ.

403
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,760
 He's saying, "No, I want to win other people over to Christ.

404
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,760
 Not so they like me, but so that they love Christ."

405
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,760
 And so that's what he's talking about in this context.

406
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,760
 So he says, "I too try to please everyone in everything I do.

407
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
 I don't just try to do what's best for me.

408
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,760
 I do what's best for others."

409
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,760
 What's the motivation so that they may be saved?

410
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,760
 And so the last question that we should ask, does it glorify God?

411
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
 Does it glorify God?

412
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,760
 So in summary, is it helpful physically, mentally, and spiritually?

413
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
 Does it bring me under its power?

414
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
 Does it hurt others?

415
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
 And does it glorify God?

416
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,760
 Now, you might be asking, okay, how does this play out in those gray areas

417
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,760
 that you shared earlier, or what we might think is a gray area?

418
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
 I would just say this.

419
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
 Hey, the bedrock again is God's Word.

420
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
 So you got to start there.

421
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,760
 Hey, does God's Word explicitly say something about this question I have?

422
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,760
 And I'm telling you, more times than not, it's going to have something to say about it.

423
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
 Okay?

424
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,760
 But in those isolated cases, what we call gray areas, if it doesn't have much to say,

425
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,760
 then these are questions that you should ask.

426
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,760
 So let's do some application.

427
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,760
 Listening to secular music.

428
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
 Okay, you've had a long day.

429
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
 It was a frustrating day.

430
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,760
 You turn on the Spotify playlist when you get in your car.

431
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,760
 You go to a rap song, and it's "Hooking Up With Girls," explicit language.

432
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,760
 Let me ask, do you need more of the world in that moment,

433
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,760
 or do you need more of, like, the kingdom of God in that moment?

434
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,760
 Like, is that going to hook you to a place of, hey, I need to hit a release.

435
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,760
 So, hey, Tinder, where you at?

436
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
 You know, like, I just need a quick hookup.

437
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,760
 Like, is that going to lead you to that place, or is it going to lead you to, you know,

438
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,760
 hey, being able to filter all that, right, and not go down places that would end in sin for you?

439
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,760
 Is it going to lead you to not glorify God?

440
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,760
 That's the last question, but let me just go back up through it.

441
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
 Is it going to hurt others?

442
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
 Probably not.

443
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,760
 You're in the car jamming out to whatever you jam out to on your Spotify playlist.

444
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
 Does it bring me under its power?

445
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
 Maybe.

446
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
 Maybe not.

447
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
 You've got to ask yourself.

448
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
 I love what JP said last week.

449
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,760
 The heart wants what it wants.

450
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
 No, he said.

451
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,760
 He said the heart wants what you feed it.

452
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:25,760
 And so whatever you feed your heart with, it has a tendency to possibly do that very thing that you're feeding.

453
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:33,760
 But I know that there's some mature believers that, hey, have a great filter, and it's not going to lead them to that place of sin.

454
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,760
 And so you've got to ask yourself, is it going to bring me under its power?

455
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,760
 Is it helpful physically, mentally, and spiritually?

456
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,760
 Am I advocating that all you do is listen to Christian music?

457
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
 No.

458
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,760
 Can you listen to secular music and still glorify God?

459
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,760
 Maybe.

460
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
 Possibly.

461
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,760
 Ask yourself these four questions.

462
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,760
 Then go to your community and say, hey, based on what you know of me, do you think it's okay for me to listen to T. Swift?

463
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
 More on that later.

464
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
 Is it okay for me to listen to Drake?

465
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:11,760
 Is it okay for me to listen to, you know, just secular artists, artists that aren't necessarily pointing to God?

466
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,760
 But they're also not pointing to the devil either, right?

467
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,760
 So you've got to determine based on these four questions.

468
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
 All right.

469
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
 Let's do another one.

470
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,760
 Drinking alcohol at a bar.

471
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
 Now, let me just say this.

472
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,760
 We've got to define drunkenness and even tipsiness, I think, in this room, okay?

473
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,760
 And you're like, oh, he just -- he didn't -- he ain't going to call it tipsiness, right?

474
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,760
 Like I want to give a little swerve, right?

475
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,760
 I'm just -- just a little something.

476
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
 Hey, you wrestle with the scriptures.

477
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
 I'm the messenger, right?

478
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
 Don't shoot me.

479
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
 I'm here just -- Ephesians 5.18.

480
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
 Put that back up on the screen.

481
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:03,760
 Do not be drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the spirit.

482
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
 Okay.

483
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
 So you tell me.

484
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
 I don't know what your limit is.

485
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,760
 I'm not getting into those nuances, okay?

486
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:19,760
 If you alter your mind in any way, can you fully be filled with the spirit?

487
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
 I don't know.

488
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,760
 I mean, maybe.

489
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
 I don't know.

490
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
 You have to determine that, right?

491
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
 Like you need to go through the list.

492
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,760
 Is this helpful physically, mentally, spiritually?

493
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
 Is it going to bring me under its power?

494
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
 Does it hurt others?

495
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
 Is it a glorified God?

496
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:38,760
 I'll just tell you, I'm 16 years into following Jesus.

497
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,760
 Before Christ, I was nearly an alcoholic.

498
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,760
 And when I came to Christ, it's not like everything just cleaned up and I never had a drink.

499
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:56,760
 And so I would go out, even after, hey, Jesus is my Lord and Savior, and, you know, I would drink.

500
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,760
 And sometimes that would lead me to drunkenness.

501
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,760
 Well, fast forward just one too many times of drunkenness.

502
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,760
 So for me, it was bringing me under its power.

503
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,760
 So for the next five years, I just said, hey, I'm just going to -- I'm going to cut it off.

504
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,760
 I'm going to starve my flesh of this privilege.

505
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
 Because the Bible doesn't say, hey, you can't drink.

506
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,760
 But for me, I couldn't because it led to an unhealthy place.

507
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:36,760
 And so you have to determine, not just you and God and the scriptures, but you need to let some other trusted voices into your life that can help make that decision.

508
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,760
 Because I think the tendency for us is like, yeah, check, I'm good.

509
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:48,760
 And we're just not very thoughtful in widening that circle and maybe asking people, right, that know us and we know them.

510
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:57,760
 And they can help make that decision for us and give you some more thoughtful questions to possibly ask based on your track history, right?

511
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,760
 And so, you know, you should ask questions like, are you running to alcohol as a means of escape because you're stressed?

512
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:12,760
 Like God is -- have you ever thought of like, hey, maybe God is allowing stress to build up in your life so you run to him.

513
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,760
 Maybe God is allowing anxiousness to build up in your life so you take that to him.

514
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:30,760
 Maybe God is allowing worry and just things that are going on in your world to pile up so you don't go to an untrusted source.

515
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:39,760
 You don't give power to a false God or a false idol like this thing that you think is going to take the edge off.

516
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,760
 And it will for a minute, maybe for an evening, but then you wake up to the same problems.

517
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,760
 Maybe God is saying, hey, enough of that.

518
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,760
 Like I want to be your source.

519
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
 I want to be your life.

520
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
 I want to be your fulfillment.

521
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:06,760
 I want to show you that I can be the prince of peace in your life.

522
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,760
 Let me say this, because I think it's easy just to pick on people that struggle with alcohol.

523
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,760
 Pick on people that don't struggle with the same things we do.

524
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:26,760
 Like we want to high side some of us as Christians and be like, alcohol, all the while you can't go a day without your caffeine.

525
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
 And if you ain't had -- oh, now I'm meddling.

526
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,760
 Now I'm stepping on some toes.

527
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
 I'm talking to myself in this.

528
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
 I love some coffee.

529
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:43,760
 But you don't have your coffee and, man, you are snarky and you're short with people and you're like, no, talk to me.

530
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
 Haven't had my coffee.

531
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
 And it's like, wait a minute.

532
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,760
 Anything that you can't live without is now potentially controlling you.

533
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
 It's hooked you.

534
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,760
 And you're relying more on that caffeine than Christ himself.

535
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,760
 And so I'm just -- again, I'm just asking questions.

536
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,760
 I don't want to just give you rules.

537
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
 I want you to wrestle with Jesus.

538
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
 He's about relationship.

539
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,760
 And he's about giving you life and life abundantly.

540
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,760
 Some of you -- let's talk about food for a second.

541
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
 Comfort food.

542
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,760
 I mean, gluttony.

543
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,760
 Like we don't talk about that much in the church.

544
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,760
 But are you running to that food as a source of life for you?

545
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,760
 As to take the edge off?

546
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,760
 Like you got to ask yourself, what is my relationship like with food?

547
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:46,760
 Is that taking the place of God right now in my life?

548
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
 Let's move.

549
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
 We got a few more I want to cover.

550
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:57,760
 Number 3, the Taylor Swift concert coming to Dallas.

551
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
 Let's just talk about all things.

552
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,760
 Like media, Netflix, like R-rated, you know, mature TV show.

553
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
 Let's just talk about all that.

554
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,760
 But specifically our staff team was having this conversation about Taylor Swift.

555
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,760
 And half of our staff bought Taylor Swift concert tickets.

556
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,760
 And I'm sure more than half of you did too.

557
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
 And that's just what you do.

558
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,760
 And some of you are trying to recover from JP's message last week where he

559
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
 called this out as well.

560
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,760
 But let me give you some more handles for this.

561
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
 Okay.

562
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,760
 I'm not sitting here saying, hey, going to a Taylor Swift concert is

563
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
 necessarily wrong in and of itself.

564
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,760
 Because I was kind of pushing back and asking, hey, is it helpful

565
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
 physically, mentally, spiritually?

566
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,760
 Is it going to bring you under its power, the things that are happening at

567
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
 that concert?

568
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
 Does it hurt others?

569
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
 Are you going to be able to glorify God there?

570
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,760
 Like she's probably at some point going to dance like a stripper.

571
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
 Is that going to hook you, right?

572
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
 Like maybe, I don't know.

573
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
 I mean, that's what one guy said.

574
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,760
 So I'm like, okay, let's talk about that, bro.

575
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,760
 So -- but then they just said, well, Josiah, hey, do you go to NFL games?

576
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
 Do you watch the NFL?

577
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
 Yeah.

578
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
 I love sports.

579
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,760
 Well, what about the cheerleaders when they start dancing on the TV?

580
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
 Do you bounce your eyes?

581
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,760
 I try to.

582
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
 No, I do, for real.

583
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,760
 But, you know, it's hard, you know what I'm saying?

584
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,760
 Or you go to a Dallas Stars game or whatever.

585
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
 The Ice Girls, right?

586
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
 I'm like, I got my little one.

587
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,760
 We ain't sitting next to -- we're not sitting on that side of the ice.

588
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
 We're going to sit right here in the middle, right?

589
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,760
 And, hey, baby, let's get the Bible app open real quick.

590
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,760
 But that's a really good point.

591
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,760
 Because they were just saying, hey, that's not going to hook me.

592
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,760
 That's not going to bring me under its power.

593
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
 Like I can filter that.

594
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,760
 And so, again, I don't want to just throw out a blanket rule for you to be

595
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
 controlled, because that's what people think, man.

596
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
 If you're here, welcome.

597
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
 You're not a Christian, you're checking out this Jesus thing.

598
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,760
 Man, Christianity is all about these rules and just to try to control people.

599
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
 That's not what it's about.

600
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,760
 It's about giving you life.

601
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,760
 It's about you understanding who Christ is, why he says what he says about

602
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,760
 certain things, so that you would have life and have it to the full.

603
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,760
 And so you've got to ask yourself these questions when it comes to media, when

604
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
 it comes to entertainment.

605
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,760
 Like, are you going to be okay if you ask these questions?

606
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,760
 Then go be free, man.

607
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,760
 Go enjoy it for the glory of God.

608
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,760
 And try your best not to entertain what would be evil and sinful.

609
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
 Let's keep going.

610
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,760
 You're like, what's he going to say next?

611
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,760
 Sleeping at your boyfriend/girlfriend's house, making out even.

612
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,760
 Okay, so your friends are going out to hang.

613
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,760
 It would be the best-case scenario for you with your significant other who

614
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,760
 struggles crossing boundaries to go hang out with them in a group, go out and

615
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
 enjoy Dallas.

616
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
 But you're like, man, I'm tired.

617
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
 It's been a long week of work.

618
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,760
 Let's order takeout.

619
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
 Let's have a movie night.

620
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,760
 And then all of a sudden, you just happen to fall asleep and you wake up.

621
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
 It's 2 a.m.

622
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
 I can't go home now.

623
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,760
 Like, it would be dangerous because I'm overly exhausted, right?

624
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,760
 And again, like, you're not going to find in God's word, hey, never spend

625
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,760
 the night at your boyfriend or girlfriend's house.

626
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
 Like, it's just not in the Bible, right?

627
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,760
 But again, you've got to ask yourself the question, is it helpful physically,

628
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
 mentally, and spiritually?

629
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,760
 Does it bring me under its power?

630
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
 Is it going to hurt others?

631
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
 Does it glorify God?

632
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
 Let me get back to personally.

633
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,760
 My wife and I were -- I got married in my 30s, y'all.

634
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,760
 So I got married a lot later.

635
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,760
 And I was told that, you know, your boy would grow up and grow in his faith.

636
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
 And, you know, I had a house.

637
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
 And, you know, I had a roommate.

638
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,760
 But, you know, he was worthless when it came to holding me accountable.

639
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,760
 But that's neither here nor there.

640
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,760
 And, you know, we flirted with this idea.

641
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,760
 And so a lot of times our flesh has gotten in the way.

642
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
 And I'm just keeping it real.

643
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
 Can I just keep it 100 a night?

644
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
 Is that cool?

645
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
 All right, cool.

646
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
 And we were just dating.

647
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,760
 And we were just, you know, at times we're like, hey, let's date in public.

648
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,760
 And let's date with big groups of people and friends.

649
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,760
 And other times you just get lazy, right?

650
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,760
 And listen, like we did a really good job.

651
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,760
 I would just say, yeah, she probably spent the night.

652
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
 Because there was times she left at 3, 4.

653
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,760
 You might as well just say, yeah, she spent the night at your house.

654
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,760
 And we won the battle for a long time.

655
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
 Like, hey, we're good.

656
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,760
 But the more and more we gave into that, hey, just come over.

657
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,760
 We'll be okay.

658
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
 We're good.

659
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,760
 The more and more we gave into that, we crossed physical boundaries.

660
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,760
 And some of you right now is like, man, what's the big deal?

661
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
 Here's what the big deal is.

662
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,760
 Let me just take 30 seconds.

663
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,760
 Are you going to lust after a woman or a man after you get married?

664
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
 Thank you.

665
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
 Yes, you will.

666
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,760
 And so if all you do is tell yourself, hey, I have a lustful desire.

667
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,760
 I'm going to give into it at any point.

668
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
 You're feeding something.

669
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
 You're just going to keep giving into it.

670
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,760
 You're just going to keep saying, hey, we're practically married,

671
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
 but we're really not married.

672
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,760
 And what you're doing is you're not practicing patience and self-control.

673
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,760
 Are you going to need patience and self-control in marriage?

674
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,760
 Yes.

675
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,760
 And to the degree you say no to your flesh now in dating

676
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,760
 and practice that patience and self-control,

677
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,760
 that's going to carry over in marriage because you're going to need it.

678
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,760
 And also it's going to breed trust because your woman or your man is going to look at you

679
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,760
 and be like, hey, even though we struggled well,

680
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,760
 even though there's moments that we gave in, hey, for the most part, man,

681
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,760
 we fought for purity.

682
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,760
 I don't have to worry about whether you're out with the boys

683
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,760
 or you're out with the girls, what you're doing,

684
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,760
 because you proved it when we were in dating and when we were engaged.

685
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,760
 Amen?

686
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
 And so that's God's heart behind it.

687
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
 He's not just trying to rip you off.

688
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
 He's not trying to sell you short, bro.

689
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
 Like he's trying to give you life.

690
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,760
 He's trying to give you -- he doesn't want you to be a statistic.

691
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,760
 It's a coin flip on whether your marriage is going to last or not.

692
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
 And I want to fight against that.

693
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
 And by God's grace, I did.

694
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,760
 And so we finally just put up the boundaries of saying, hey,

695
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,760
 we're just not going to do that anymore.

696
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,760
 Even though you have a house and I have an apartment here in Dallas,

697
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,760
 we're just not going to do it.

698
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,760
 And so we had to invite community in and they had to call us at like, you know,

699
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,760
 awkward times at night making sure that, you know, we were hanging out at a coffee shop

700
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,760
 or dating in public, whatever it was.

701
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,760
 And it was hard, but you know what it did?

702
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,760
 It drove us to marriage.

703
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,760
 It drove us to put a ring on it.

704
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
 Amen?

705
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,760
 You know what I'm saying?

706
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,760
 All right, man, I got -- let's just do two more.

707
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
 Do two more.

708
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,760
 Man, there's a lot.

709
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
 I hope this is helpful.

710
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,760
 All right, bikini for girls, shirtless pics for guys, just the outer appearance.

711
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,760
 You could say guys got to get a fade every two weeks, shoes, fillers,

712
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,760
 lash extensions, acrylic nails, spray tint, the whole thing.

713
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,760
 Like just the outer, you know, appearance, right?

714
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,760
 Listen, I'm not giving you a rule.

715
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
 I'm giving you these questions.

716
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
 Is it helpful physically, mentally, and spiritually?

717
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
 Is it going to bring you under its power?

718
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
 Does it hurt others?

719
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
 Does it glorify God?

720
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,760
 I'm not here to be your Holy Spirit.

721
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,760
 I'm here to push you back to him so that you wrestle with these questions

722
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,760
 because you know, you know what your heart really wants.

723
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,760
 You know why you want that thing.

724
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,760
 In the name of body positivity or this is what everyone else has done,

725
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,760
 you kind of justified your actions in wearing this or going here or buying that.

726
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,760
 But deep down, you really want the attention from the opposite sex.

727
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,760
 You really want that guy to slide into your DMs or guys,

728
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:35,760
 like you just want that girl to gawk over you and tell you how great you are.

729
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:43,760
 And you just want someone to gas you up because you've been in that gym looking good

730
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:50,760
 and you've lost your 20 pounds and you're down to 10% body, whatever it is, right?

731
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,760
 And listen, there's something in me that wants that.

732
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,760
 And I'm just saying, what's the motivation of your heart?

733
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,760
 These things aren't bad in and of themselves.

734
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,760
 But the motivation of your heart can tell everything.

735
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,760
 And so, you know, is there any real reason to show that much body to anyone

736
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,760
 other than just to kind of get praise?

737
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,760
 I don't know.

738
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,760
 I'm not with you.

739
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,760
 You know, some of you might say, well, it's more of a -- it's not more of a me problem.

740
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,760
 It's more of a them problem, right?

741
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
 Like I'm not trying to win their approval.

742
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
 No, you're not.

743
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,760
 I can see how you got there.

744
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:41,760
 The only problem with that is when I look at what Philippians 2, 3 through 5 says,

745
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,760
 it just says this, "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,

746
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,760
 but in humility count others more significant than yourself.

747
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,760
 Let each of you look not only to the interest of yourself,

748
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,760
 but also for the interest of others."

749
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,760
 And so this is the question that I think a lot of us just need to ask is, hey,

750
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
 is it going to hurt others?

751
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,760
 Like Paul just says, I'm not going to eat meat again if it's going to cause my

752
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,760
 brother to stumble.

753
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,760
 Like you just need to look at the motivation of your heart.

754
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
 You need to bring this to community and just say, hey,

755
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
 what do you think about this?

756
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
 Is this legalistic?

757
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,760
 Or is this leading me to, you know, just sin and I'm good with it because I've

758
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,760
 made it a gray area.

759
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,760
 Last, last one.

760
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,760
 Smoking weed in states where it's legal.

761
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
 This was like the 50/50, right?

762
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,760
 50% of you said, hey, go for it.

763
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,760
 50% said, no, it's a sin.

764
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,760
 Even though I believe most people, like they don't let borders stop them

765
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,760
 from smoking weed, right, I can see how you get there.

766
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,760
 Like some of you have this mindset, well, it's okay to have that glass of

767
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,760
 wine, you know, or that beer, that, you know, liquor at 21.

768
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
 It's okay for me to hit this blunt.

769
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,760
 And again, I'm just, I'm asking, I'm genuinely asking, like,

770
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,760
 is it more to help you with your, is it really to help you with your

771
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,760
 anxiety and sleep?

772
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,760
 Or if you had to be honest, you like how you feel.

773
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,760
 And it allows you to check out of reality.

774
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:32,760
 I don't think Ephesians 5, 18 is just for alcohol.

775
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,760
 I think it's for a lot of different things.

776
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,760
 Do not be drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled

777
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,760
 with the spirit.

778
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,760
 Can you be filled with the spirit and filled with weed?

779
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,760
 I would love to have that discussion.

780
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,760
 I genuinely, I want to learn.

781
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,760
 Because I don't want you to do anything that would suppress the

782
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
 spirit of God in you.

783
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,760
 Because he's our guide.

784
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,760
 Like the Bible says when you commit your life to Jesus, he gives you

785
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,760
 another power so that you would submit to that power and not to the

786
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,760
 ways of the world's power.

787
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,760
 And so you got to ask yourself those questions.

788
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,760
 You got to ask yourself.

789
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,760
 And in closing, there's a lot of others we could do.

790
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,760
 But I hope this was helpful.

791
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,760
 But I think in closing, if we had to be honest with ourselves, if we

792
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,760
 had to be honest with ourselves tonight, a lot of the gray areas in

793
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,760
 our life, God's word probably has to say something about them.

794
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,760
 Like in other words, it's probably a sin.

795
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,760
 Like the temptation is for us to make all the gray areas of our life,

796
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:53,760
 you know, and the Bible is very clear that, hey, not all sin is gray

797
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,760
 areas and not all gray areas is sin.

798
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,760
 But I think for some of us, we want to make all gray areas gray.

799
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,760
 And I don't see that in my Bible fully.

800
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,760
 And so what I see in my Bible is this, that there is none righteous,

801
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,760
 not one, Romans 3.

802
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,760
 What I see in my Bible, Romans 3, 23, that all have sinned and fallen

803
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,760
 short of the glory of God.

804
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,760
 What I see in my Bible is Jesus stepping onto the scene and he says,

805
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,760
 hey, I am the way, John 14, 6.

806
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
 I am the truth.

807
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,760
 I am the life.

808
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,760
 And no man or woman comes to God except through me, comes to the

809
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,760
 Father except through me.

810
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,760
 And so in a world of relativism, yeah, relativism, where you have your

811
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,760
 truth, I have my truth, God, through the person of Christ,

812
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
 debunks that.

813
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,760
 The God who reset the calendar on your phone.

814
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,760
 The God who said, hey, I'm going to come down for sinful men and

815
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:07,760
 women because I see that this world is chaotic and it's filled with

816
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
 pain.

817
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,760
 It's filled with suffering.

818
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:17,760
 It's filled with things that don't point the glory back to me.

819
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,760
 And news flash, like God is a glory thief.

820
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,760
 Like he's created you.

821
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,760
 And everything that we do, we're either worshiping him or we're

822
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,760
 worshiping self.

823
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,760
 And he will have no rivals.

824
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,760
 Like he's a jealous guy.

825
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,760
 But he says in the midst of your sin and my sin, I'm going to send

826
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,760
 Jesus and we're about to celebrate him in just a few weeks.

827
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,760
 We celebrate him every week but specifically on Easter.

828
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:53,760
 And Jesus came over 2,000 years ago in flesh.

829
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,760
 And he was raised in wisdom and stature, the Bible says.

830
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,760
 And he grew up and he was without sin.

831
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,760
 He was perfect in thought, word, and action.

832
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,760
 The areas of my life that I fall short in every day.

833
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,760
 And the Bible says that he went to a cross, he hung there.

834
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,760
 Because the wages of sin is death.

835
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,760
 Like somebody had to pay for your sin and my sin.

836
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,760
 Like have you thought about that?

837
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,760
 Like who is going to pay for your sin?

838
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,760
 Jesus can pay for your sin.

839
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,760
 And the Bible says in that moment the wrath and the judgment that

840
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,760
 should have been poured out on you and me was poured out on him.

841
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,760
 And he soaked up every last ounce of that wrath and judgment.

842
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,760
 And three days later what we celebrate on Easter is he defeated sin

843
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,760
 and death.

844
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,760
 You tell me another religion that teaches that.

845
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,760
 That's what separates Christianity from all other religions.

846
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,760
 All other religions teach you have to do X, Y, and Z to get to God.

847
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,760
 And God said no, no, no, I did it all for you.

848
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,760
 And so you can't do enough to get to me.

849
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,760
 And so you've been saved by grace through faith, not of yourself,

850
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,760
 it's a gift from God so that no man may boast.

851
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,760
 And so in this moment there's certain things that God says are black and

852
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,760
 white because they're not going to give you life.

853
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,760
 And some of you, like you're going to check out and you're like,

854
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,760
 no, man, I know, I found life.

855
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,760
 And you're just going to have to learn the hard way.

856
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,760
 Like I had to do for 20 something years of my life.

857
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,760
 And you're going to get to the end of your rope and I hope that you don't

858
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,760
 forget this message of the gospel.

859
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:39,760
 That God loves you so much that you're never too far gone.

860
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,760
 That his grace will meet you now, tomorrow,

861
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,760
 or in the days ahead if he decides to ordain your life and let you live

862
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,760
 that long.

863
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,760
 And three days later, scripture says in history of chords that he rose again

864
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,760
 from the dead to defeat it.

865
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,760
 And now the world celebrates for years and years to come.

866
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,760
 The one who is and the one who will come again.

867
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
 He's coming back y'all.

868
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,760
 Like I read this book, I read the end, he's coming back.

869
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,760
 And he's coming back for his bride, the church.

870
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,760
 What are you going to do with Jesus?

871
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,760
 Because at the end of the day, like it's all about him.

872
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,760
 It's all about him.

873
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,760
 And so let's not get caught up in silly arguments and things that don't

874
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,760
 matter for all the return.

875
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,760
 Let's be men and women of the book.

876
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,760
 Let's be men and women who pursue Jesus.

877
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,760
 Let's be men and women who don't throw stones and condemn,

878
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,760
 let's be men and women who don't pull a seat up at the table when people

879
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,760
 don't look like us, act like us, maybe dress like us,

880
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
 do the things that we would do.

881
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,760
 And let's lead them in a way that Christ would lead them.

882
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,760
 Christ hung out with sinners, you know that, right?

883
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,760
 But he didn't -- he wasn't controlled by that.

884
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:14,760
 And so he's here to propose questions from his word that will hopefully be a

885
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,760
 guide for you.

886
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:21,760
 And so I just encourage you to ask these four questions in the days ahead.

887
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,760
 And may we be a people who love him with all of our heart,

888
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,760
 our mind, and our strength.

889
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,760
 And if we do that, then go do whatever you want.

890
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,760
 Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength,

891
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,760
 and then go do whatever you want.

892
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,760
 Let me pray that we would tonight.

893
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,760
 God in heaven, you're a good daddy.

894
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,760
 I know there's people in this space that aren't trusting that you're a good

895
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,760
 daddy.

896
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,760
 But I pray that they would see you tonight in some way.

897
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,760
 And God, you would meet them right where they are.

898
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,760
 And that you would do your greatest work and that you would go before us in

899
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,760
 this place and we would be more equipped to navigate sin,

900
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,760
 to navigate the gray areas of life, and just to be more of your men and

901
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,760
 women.

902
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,760
 So take ground in those places of our heart that you need to take ground in

903
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,760
 for your glory.

904
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,760
 It's in Christ's name we pray.

905
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,760
 Amen.

906
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,340
 (gentle music)
