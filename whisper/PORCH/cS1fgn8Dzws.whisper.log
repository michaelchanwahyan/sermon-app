[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   I mean he's practically dating a model. She told me they went to Cabo and he
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.440]   paid for the whole thing. Dude she does his laundry and cooks. He proposed at the
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.880]   Eiffel Tower in Paris. Bro she plays in his fancy football league and knows more
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.880]   about the Cowboys that he does. She's got the husband, the house, she's got it all.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:31.320]   What more could you ask for? What more could you ask for? Come on, relationship
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520]   goals starts tonight. How we doing porch?
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.440]   So great to be back with you this evening. Hey do you guys remember back in
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.460]   school when you would have these projects like class projects and the
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.280]   teacher would begin to put you in partners? Anybody remember this? Like you
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.580]   got to find a partner. Anybody? Okay some of you remember this. I remember being in
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.080]   biology class very vividly and and hoping with everything the teachers
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.080]   going around saying hey you guys need to partner up what we're gonna do a project
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.880]   together and hoping that she was gonna partner me with Kelly. Okay but you guys
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.200]   know like you Kelly went to your school like head cheerleader gorgeous sat
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.240]   behind me in biology Kelly and so think Kelly Kapowski. Kelly we'll just call her
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.520]   that and so and so I'm like teachers like okay I want you two and you two and
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.840]   I'm just dear Lord please if you exist and and she says and Jonathan you and
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:43.800]   Kelly. And and it was awesome because I'm thinking this is my chance like this is
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.640]   gonna be amazing me and Kelly partnered up on this and so the problem then
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.440]   ensued because the teacher therefore outlined the project we were going to be
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.800]   doing which was dissecting a frog. Okay and I didn't know that Kelly didn't like
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.320]   to dissect frogs and so therefore there we are we kind of get put in this this
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.040]   bench we put our our cape what not cape what are those things called our coat we
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.960]   put our lab coat on and our goggles and we have our scapule there and then
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.240]   there's this poor defenseless dead animal in front of us and Kelly's like I
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.680]   ain't touching that and I'm like well how are we gonna and so I'm looking at
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.240]   the frog I'm looking at her I'm looking at the frog and then I'm realizing Kelly's
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:38.240]   not so smart. Now I changed the name to protect the beautiful and yeah and so
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.880]   but I'm thinking how am I going to do this project with her and as we got into
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.360]   it I started realizing I chose the wrong partner and the reason I chose the wrong
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.520]   partner is because I didn't understand the project that laid in front of us. I
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.560]   didn't know what we were going to be doing together and as I think about
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.480]   spending so much time with dozens scratch that hundreds of people that are
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.200]   about to start this adventure called marriage I'm realizing they don't
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.120]   understand the project that sits in front of them like everything that has
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.480]   defined their view of marriage has been Hollywood movies music TV magazines the
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.800]   people listen hear me out the people with the single highest divorce rate on
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.200]   the planet the folks who are so bad at it are telling you how to do it and so
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.280]   as we start this series relationship goals we've got to go back to the one
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.520]   who invented the institution called marriage the one who set out the project
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.520]   laid it out in front of us and tells us what it's for did you know that God says
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.480]   hey this is why you get married in the Bible and he lays out the specific
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.080]   reasons and so as we start this series this evening we're going to look at the
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.680]   relationship goal marriage the ultimate relationship goal and the reason we have
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.880]   to start there because before we can start with well how do I ask her out or
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.960]   how do I get asked out we have to start with why do you want to be asked out the
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.320]   reason you date is marriage this idea of dating for fun it's a very listen hear
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.320]   me out very new phenomenon it's only been around less than a hundred years
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.000]   less than a century to have people been dating for fun very Western idea it
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.640]   doesn't exist everywhere around the world and as dating has been become more
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.800]   and more fun marriage has become less and less fun so we're not doing it much
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.640]   anymore let me give you some statistics to outline this problem this problem in
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.640]   1960 seven out of ten people in their 20s were married compared with just two
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:09.400]   out of ten today in the 60s it was 70% today it's 20% we're going a direction
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.720]   we're trending we're not trending well for the first time in history the
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.960]   average American now spends more years single than married so we're not doing
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.600]   this we're doing this less and we're not good at it about 50% of marriages end in
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.160]   divorce so if I was to flip a coin right now and had you call out heads or tails
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.160]   that could determine your marriage fate or at least that's what the statistics
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.480]   would be like for you how I could draw a line right here most of you in the room
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.720]   will get married despite your biggest fears or in spite of your biggest fears
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.200]   and reality this whole entire half your marriage won't work out that is a really
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.360]   gloomy forecast let's change it the information hear me out the information
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.840]   I'm gonna give you tonight I've been married 11 years I I really wish someone
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.480]   would have told me what I'm about to tell you I really wish someone would have
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.000]   told me these things and so many people in marriage get there and say man I
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.200]   didn't know it's gonna be like this I wish someone would have told me what it
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.880]   was really for what the project was so that I could have chosen the right
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.880]   partner you cannot choose the right partner until you understand what the
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.960]   project is and so that's what we're looking at the inventor of marriages
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.240]   marriage tells us three reasons why we get married I'm gonna be in Genesis 2
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.680]   tonight if you want to turn there it's easy to find first book of the Bible
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.000]   second chapter we're gonna be in verses 7 and 8 and then 18 through 25 I'm also
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.760]   gonna be in Matthew at a moment and then maybe Ephesians if there's time and so
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.680]   marriage exists for different reasons than you think as you came in here this
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.640]   evening in Genesis 2 God is literally gonna say this is why we get married and
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.480]   Genesis 2 is an expounding on the creation story in Genesis 1 that we have
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.240]   the six days of creation in Genesis 2 you zoom in on the sixth day of creation
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.400]   so same creation story it just comes in and magnifies the sixth day you know
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:24.200]   what was created on the sixth day anybody man whoa man marriage was created
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:34.040]   on the sixth day marriage let's go verse 7 then the Lord God formed a man from
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.880]   the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.200]   man became a living being God created a human now the Lord God had planted a
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.880]   garden in the east in Eden and there he put the man he had formed and so God
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:57.960]   creates a human being a man a male human being in paradise think the Arboretum
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.680]   meets the perfect zoo animals with no cages and they're nice meets the most
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.320]   amazing man cave you can think of and there's Adam like he's in perfection and
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:15.280]   he gives him some things to do and then he says this in Genesis 1 we see God
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.320]   made it and it was good God made it and it was good God made it it was good God
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.840]   made it was good God made it it was good God made man and woman and it was very
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.200]   very good God says everything is good there's no sin that's entered the world
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:35.880]   yet Adam is in perfection but then God says this crazy thing the Lord God said
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:45.760]   it is not good it is not good for the man to be alone I will make a helper
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:54.600]   suitable for him and so Creator God says there's something that's not good I need
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.480]   to make a helper for the man he could have made anything he could have made
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.800]   another man he could have made a centaur he could have made a robot he could have
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.360]   made anything he could have made some crazy talking cat with the head of a
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:15.720]   bull he could have made anything let me show you the mix for the perfect helper
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.000]   now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.360]   birds in the sky he brought them to the man to see what he would name them and
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.040]   whatever the man called each living creature that was its name so the man
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.160]   gave names to all the livestock the birds in the sky and all the wild
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.280]   animals so man is responsible for like dog cat right so if a woman was
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.680]   responsible be with like cuddly little nugget that purrs but man was responsible
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.360]   dog cat but for Adam no suitable helper was found so the Lord God caused the man
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.760]   to fall into a deep sleep it seems like guys are often sleeping when
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:59.840]   relationships start it's like what we're dating what and and while he was
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.880]   sleeping while he was sleeping Adam sleeping God took one of his ribs and
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.200]   then closed up the place with flesh then the Lord God made a woman from the rib
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:19.000]   he had taken out of the man and he brought her to the man and the man said
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.480]   now these are the first words ever documented in the history of humanity
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:32.160]   that a human spoke this is now it's a it's a song it's poetry and a song he
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.360]   sings he sing woman for the first time I mean who could blame him I'd sing to
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:44.120]   this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:52.000]   for she was taken out of man I know what you're thinking he should have went with
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.760]   boys to men but he didn't he went with that and so you can imagine if we're
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.400]   doing a wedding and I'm like hey you know say I do you may kiss the bride and
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.000]   the guys like she shall be called woman I mean this is what happened right here
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.640]   right but it is beautiful he's saying you were made of me from me for me woman
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:23.560]   you were made of me from me for me and that is why a man it says leaves his
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.160]   father and mother and is united to his wife this is why a person gets married
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.440]   your Bible might say for this reason that is why a man leaves his father and
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   mother and is united to his wife and they become one flesh and then it says
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.400]   these profound words that Adam and his wife were both naked and they felt no
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.440]   shame that there's perfect intimacy between them can you imagine there is
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.840]   what that means is there is no thought of self that's the most amazing sex that
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.280]   you could ever imagine that two people would come together with no clothes on
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.360]   imperfection and there's not a single thought of self am I too big am I too
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.720]   little do I look good what does she think what does he think nothing no
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   shame no insecurity just two people getting it on
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:34.600]   it's beautiful but wait a second it says this is why God interjects into this
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.040]   story trying to explain something to us he's telling us something that's not
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.040]   just for Adam and Eve because he says this is why a man leaves his father and
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.720]   mother Adam and Eve didn't have a father and mother this truth isn't for Adam and
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.280]   Eve this truth is for you and me this is why a person leaves their father and
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.400]   mother and is united to their spouse a man leaves his father and mother and is
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   united to his wife and the two become one flesh they become one God is talking
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.640]   about a profound reality that we don't you you came in here you don't know what
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:11.000]   this means this is deep theology but it's so important in considering
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.120]   venturing down the project of marriage and choosing a partner we got to have a
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.240]   death grip on what this means it's a template for the reasons for marriage
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:31.320]   this text and think about Eve she has no other options is she compatible with
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.680]   Adam like I don't know man what if what if Adam is out of shape and drives a
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.120]   lame car I mean is this still cool what if he doesn't have a job there's Adam
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.280]   like if she swipes left there's no one left you know what is what is she gonna
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.800]   do right there they are all of these thoughts that we spend so much time
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.320]   thinking of in right here in the garden is just simple as a man as a woman be
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:14:01.560]   together be fruitful and multiply and so we're talking about the project of
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.320]   marriage the reasons for marriage and the first reason from Genesis 2 is to
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:17.800]   have help the reason you get married is to have help God says it's not good for
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.920]   man to be alone there's something that is not good the Lord God said is not
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.000]   good for man to be alone I will make a helper suitable for him man is made in
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.640]   the image of God God is an eternally relational being father son and spirit
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:41.520]   God didn't make man because he likes relationships he made man to be a part
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:50.560]   of his character his person three in one and Adams placed in Eden with this huge
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.000]   job that you would garden the whole earth and God says but you can't do it
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.240]   alone let me find someone to help you and none of these things I've created so
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.160]   far will help you I need to create something unique something like you but
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:11.960]   different from you something similar to you but a completely different being
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:17.560]   there's only man and woman he could have made a thousand different things this
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:27.640]   is his design the man gave names to all the livestock verse 20 and the birds of
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.440]   the heavens and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.320]   but for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him so none of the
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.680]   animals work like your Labrador retriever might be called your best
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:53.040]   friend but it's not the truth is man's best friend is a woman okay that's the
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   reality is that animals are great companionship but they're not the
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:05.120]   ultimate companion that we were made for that that's someone that God made us
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.160]   for this kind of relationship the scripture says he finds a wife finds the
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.280]   good finds a good thing or finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:19.800]   this word helper it's it's a sir in the Hebrew it's partner or help mate and
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:26.640]   some women think it's degrading to be called a helper I agree it's degrading
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.600]   it's degrading to men it says we need help it says we can't do it alone it's
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.920]   like God's like looking down there's like man you're gonna need some help bro
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.080]   let me let me give you someone to help you out someone a little better at
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.560]   things than you and he creates woman and this is a beautiful thing and if you're
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.600]   like well I don't want to be called a sir can I tell you something this is the
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.280]   word for God 16 times in the Old Testament that God is our helper that
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.080]   God is our a sir this is a tremendous compliment to be called this word I
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:02.240]   would wear it proud if I were you and so in searching for a helper you and I
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.800]   we're not looking for the one if you will we're looking for someone who knows
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:16.120]   God and is gonna help us become like God called sanctification I know that some
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:22.040]   of you guys are looking for the scholar theologian models on the weekend and who
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:39.280]   loves sex but is a virgin it's the laughter of familiar thought and the
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.800]   truth is you need to find someone who understands the project of marriage and
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:57.320]   is ready for it so then I get that game on I'm ready for that and we put so much
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:03.360]   investment in the things that fade the fastest and the help goes both ways it's
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.680]   not just that women are men men's helpers and Ephesians 5 actually
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.960]   presents the man is the helper and then it says this that as you submit to one
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.840]   another out of reverence for Christ that there's this mutual submission that's
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.840]   happening and this is a huge part of our sanctification that these people who are
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:26.240]   very different come together and they're opposite almost opposites in the way
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.240]   they feel in the different ways that God's wired them and created them and
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.120]   the only way that they're gonna work for a lifetime is through full fully
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:39.840]   surrendering to God's Holy Spirit that's sanctification that this would happen in
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.320]   marriage God would be making us like Christ and so the world says to marry to
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.240]   be happy but God says in his scripture in Ephesians 5 that marriage exists so
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.760]   that you would become holy so that you would be like God now there is joy in
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.360]   there marriage is a beautifully good great thing but if you're looking for
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:05.160]   someone to make you happy you are putting a responsibility on them that
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.840]   they will not be able to fulfill apart from Christ you need to know that
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:23.320]   marriage is good but it is work and it requires help it requires help my wife's
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.000]   amazing I see this in her all the time my wife's name is Monica if we don't
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.160]   know each other as I said we've married 11 years we have three kids and I mean
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.280]   just this we got home Sunday it's been a whirlwind so I haven't been here and
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:44.000]   just yesterday she was asked me she said do you want to unpack your suitcase or
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.200]   would you like me to help with that and I can read between the lines I just
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.040]   responded politely I don't know helper what do you think no I didn't say that
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:58.240]   she didn't like it I didn't say that but I think about the last two weeks I've
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.520]   taught 13 times in three different places in 14 days and what that looks
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.760]   like is preparing late at night and early in the morning and and and it
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:14.440]   looks like her carrying a lot of the weight and and sometimes I'm I was we
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:21.200]   were talking about this and I just said I you know what I take on what I can do
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.440]   it really depends on what your capacity is to do things without me and she just
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.680]   appropriately in a very sanctifying and loving way responded says I don't I
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:37.360]   don't know that it does babe she said I think it depends on your ability to go
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.680]   and do those things and then come home and be all in and have energy left for
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:48.520]   us and I was like burn okay Wow but but she's right like it's this constant
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.000]   dying to self and and asking hey how can I serve and and people ask me all the
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.680]   time they say you know this does Monica serve at the porch you know do you guys
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.560]   serve together and the reality is I could tell you I've been doing the porch
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.320]   for eight years Monica I bet has been to you know I could count on two hands how
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.520]   many porches she's been but she serves you guys every Tuesday tonight she's
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.240]   feeding our three little ones she's tucking them in alone she's praying to
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:22.280]   them I mean I can't do this without her help I couldn't do this you don't think
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:27.280]   about that in marriage this dividing and conquering that happens so often so that
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.840]   an effective ministry can and will happen and so one of the things you will
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:38.400]   need help doing is my second point this evening marriage exists for the reason
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.960]   for marriage to raise children according to God's plan to raise children
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.760]   according to God's plan that this is God's design that God made a man and
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:54.680]   then he made a woman to do things that a man can't do a man cannot bring forth
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.560]   life God's looking at a man and he's like hey what what do I need to do what
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.040]   wiring do I need to change within him so that life can be brought forth you know
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.800]   what I will create a separate being apart from him so that life can be
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.360]   brought forth by the two of them coming together in this act that I invented
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.240]   that I created that I am the master of no one knows how to do it better than
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:20.120]   God you want tips tricks and techniques read your Bible because he's the one who
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:26.160]   invented the act he's the one that that thought of the parts made him work the
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.760]   way they do the part you see in the parts you don't see that was God's
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:39.120]   genius design and so together man and woman as complimentary equals take on
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.480]   this task of the first Great Commission the second Great Commission we see in
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.160]   Matthew 28 go into the world go into the nations telling them the things that
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.200]   I've told you who I am Jesus says but the first Great Commission shows up here
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.680]   in Genesis where God says hey I want you to form and fill the earth be fruitful
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:05.560]   and multiply have lots of babies and tell them who I am some people say that
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.280]   the religion of Islam is growing faster than Christianity if you look at the
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:16.200]   data there are more converts in Christianity Islam if it is growing
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:23.560]   faster than Christianity it's only because of procreation reproduction
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:30.840]   they have more babies than Christians do why because Christians live in America
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.760]   where everybody wants two kids one boy and one girl you know I mean this is
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.040]   like simple worldview that we have we we think hey I know what I want my life to
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.240]   be like we say hey I'm gonna make those decisions according to my preference not
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   according to God's Word not according to what he says how many babies do I want
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.040]   to have that's how many I'm gonna have God how many babies do you want me to
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.960]   have you ever thought about that does he say does he say anything about that does
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:01.040]   his word say anything about how many babies we should have in Psalm 127 it
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:06.200]   says that children are blessing from the Lord blessed is the man who has lots of
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:13.560]   them whose quiver is full of them it says and so if you begin to think about
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.440]   children as a burden you don't see children the way God sees children God
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.920]   says they're a blessing if you begin to think about children according to what
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.040]   Hollywood TV media radio magazines have told you about children or your
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.080]   non-believing friends have told you about children then you don't see
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.120]   children according to a biblical worldview as God says that children are
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.560]   let me just bring this really close to home Monica and I we had one child we
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:46.400]   had Presley she was born Presley Kate Presley who Presley did not stop crying
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:52.080]   for nine months okay she did not sleep for nine months I mean I'm hardly
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:57.120]   exaggerating it was I was just like there is no way it is this hard there is
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:02.080]   no way that everybody goes through this I mean we were like so done I'm thinking
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.640]   vasectomy if you don't know what that is we'll explain it later but but I'm
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.840]   thinking long-term birth control and then we have Finley and we both cried a
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:24.280]   lot how did this happen you know I can't keep my hands to myself and then and we
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:34.800]   were done though we were done and then we had Weston and now we're done for
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:42.640]   real except I started reading this I turned to Psalm 127 and I'm like do I
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.520]   see children as a blessing and I said babe I don't know if we should be done
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.240]   can we be done and we started this wrestling that that I just want to be
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:56.040]   really transparent with you I'm right in the middle of I hardly feel equipped to
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.640]   even instruct you in this way because I'm like man God can we be done like I
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.880]   always thought it was up to me and my preference and what I wanted and then I
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.720]   opened the word and you say these things that you have these desires and that you
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.560]   want Christians to fill the earth through procreation and should we even
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.440]   prevent that should we stop that these are all questions we're asking and I
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.120]   don't have the answers for you this evening but I do have this I'm certain
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.920]   of this you need to be asking these questions as you think about marriage if
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.960]   you want a family if you want children you you need to be thinking you know
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:36.000]   start with his word can I stop that prevent that should I throttle that are
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:45.160]   those things that I should even do I know this is strange so I'm asking the
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.640]   question what informs your decisions your preferences or God's Word and so
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.160]   let me just show you what a biblical worldview is I I'm committed to keeping
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.840]   this graph in front of you a lot and so this really paints a picture it's gonna
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.560]   pop up there in a minute magically this paints a picture of what worldview is
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.440]   and so worldview when you hear biblical worldview worldview answers the question
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:08.140]   what is real worldview sits underneath your beliefs your beliefs answer the
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.880]   question what is true the from your beliefs come your values or your goals
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.840]   if you will that asked the question what is good and out of that comes your
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:24.200]   behavior that's what everybody else sees that's what we do so you have worldview
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   beliefs goals and behavior and so if you have a self-centered worldview around
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.360]   marriage this is what it looks like your self-centered worldview say what is real
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:39.260]   well my desires are real okay and then you think okay well well then what is
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.420]   true well here's what is true sex feels good kids are a burden and so then you
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.080]   ask the question what is good well pleasure is ultimately good anything
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.920]   that feels good anything that satisfies my desires and so then what do you do
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:28:01.120]   you date around and you get stuck there and it's from a cultural worldview a
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.320]   worldly worldview a self-centered worldview and so if you take this book
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:11.760]   and you put it in the middle there right then it's gonna change it's you're gonna
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.680]   get what's called a biblical worldview a biblical worldview ask the question what
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.120]   is real well God is real his kingdom is real his plans are real for you he
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.280]   created you he created you with the purpose it's your job to find God's
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.600]   purpose for your life this is very different than you're gonna hear in
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:31.740]   Dallas Fort Worth Houston downtown right this is different what is real God is
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.520]   real what is true well then God's Word is true God's Word needs to inform
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.400]   everything I do God's Word needs to inform the way I think about
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.280]   relationships what I do for the weekend the way that I date the way that I spend
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.760]   time with each other what is good God's Word says children are good marriage is
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.960]   a good thing regardless of what I've seen God's Word says marriage is good
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:29:00.280]   and children are good and so what do we do we marry and we make disciples or we
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:06.880]   honor God in our singleness and we make disciples we do everything we can for
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.560]   God's glory now that may feel like a huge life change from where you're at
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:16.120]   right now the way you get there is one step at a time you begin to ingest his
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:21.240]   word know what it says know that he informs these decisions and ask God what
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:27.720]   would you have for me having a great marriage starts there it starts when
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:34.680]   you're 18 17 16 it starts when you're 13 when you begin to learn the Word of God
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:40.040]   and you write it on your heart and you understand his desires for your life and
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:49.720]   so God made marriage and asks us to have babies and disciple them and the way
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.280]   that we do that is through sex to becoming one flesh and God made sex feel
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:59.440]   good but the pleasure in sex serves a purpose let me say that again so you
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:05.960]   understand the pleasure in sex serves a purpose think about if if sex felt like
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:11.320]   a root canal how long listen humor me how long would it take for the extinction
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:17.360]   of humanity right like this thing that brings forth humans really really hurts
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:22.880]   and nobody wants to do it it'd be like generation one done like nobody else
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:27.040]   left right but God made it feel good so that we would come together that we
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.520]   couldn't keep our hands to ourselves and that babies would be brought forth and
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.080]   what we do is we try to capture the set the pleasure of sex without the purpose
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:43.120]   of sex so that we can use it for our own selfish desires when in marriage it
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:49.160]   serves another purpose and that brings me to this my third and final point the
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:57.360]   reason for marriage to display the permanence of God's commitment now that
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.480]   sounds like Christian ease it sounds like theology is actually really
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.400]   important if you're considering marriage if marriage is something that you want
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.080]   to do you have to understand that marriage exists for a reason to display
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:14.240]   the permanence of God's commitment this is the profound mystery that Paul writes
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.440]   about in Ephesians 5 that he says hey marriage a man and a woman coming
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.200]   together it's actually about Jesus in his church that the church is called the
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.600]   bride and Jesus is the bridegroom and the bridegroom is going to come back for
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:31.360]   his bride and take us to be with him for how long forever and ever and ever and
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.320]   ever and ever and ever and God's commitment to you is forever and ever
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.720]   and ever and ever so marriage exists God created it to display to the watching
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.240]   world who does not know him the permanence of God's commitment to us
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.080]   Jesus actually gives us commentary on Genesis chapter 2 where we've been
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:55.120]   reading Jesus talks about it in Matthew chapter 19 it says this some Pharisees
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.080]   these religious people asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:05.000]   any and every reason and Jesus responds haven't you read he replied that at the
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.920]   beginning the Creator by design made them male and female he he created these
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.320]   two beings for a purpose he gave them parts so that the parts would come
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:21.200]   together and life would be brought forth and said for this reason a man will
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.800]   leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:31.480]   become one flesh so they are no longer two but one flesh Jesus says therefore
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:38.120]   then this therefore what God has joined together let no one no judge no person
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:45.040]   nobody separate what does he mean there is that confusing I mean is there any
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.120]   other translation of that right there what God has brought together don't
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   separate don't let it come apart that's what it means in the Greek there's a
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:02.480]   joke it's always good when you got to help people it's a joke last night I was
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:09.120]   watching TV and I was actually watching something that someone had sent to me
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.320]   and it was an interview of Cameron Diaz with Bill Maher and she just said this
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:18.400]   in this interview talking about marriage I have no problem with commitment when
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:23.680]   I'm with someone I am 1,000% committed to them she says and I build my life with
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:30.320]   that person as if it's a marriage but I would be divorced a few times by now if
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:39.480]   I did marry them okay let me explain to you the depthness of Cameron Diaz and
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.720]   what she's saying here she's saying when I'm with somebody I'm committed to them
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:50.480]   until I'm not and then I'm not and and what's funny about that or what's crazy
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.880]   or ironic about that I think that's how some of us view commitment that
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.440]   commitment is as long as it's mutual and we're together we're committed and then
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.000]   when it's mutual that we're apart then we're not committed anymore and that's
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.240]   just fine and what it is it's not training for marriage it's training for
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:09.440]   divorce serial dating is not training you for the commitment of marriage you
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.080]   date someone until you don't like them anymore and you break up with them you
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.080]   get in another relationship until you don't like them anymore and you break up
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.720]   with them instead of putting the first things first so that when you come into
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.600]   a relationship with them you know so much of what you're hoping to figure out
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   in dating so that then you can just figure out those last and final things
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.320]   you say hey should we get married because we date for marriage as believers
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:41.240]   and the reason this is a big deal is because it's a picture of God's love for
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.680]   us so many of us we've been so brainwashed by Hollywood we're looking
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:51.760]   for a soulmate you're not looking for a soulmate you're looking for a soulmate
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:57.080]   an S O L E mate one mate a singular mate that is what you're looking for you're
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:01.520]   not looking for a soulmate star-crossed lovers you're looking for a soulmate one
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:07.920]   mate one person for a lifetime that is what you are searching for because
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:14.240]   that's a picture of God's love for us see I think that a lot of us think that
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.360]   God loves us like Cameron Diaz loves people that he loves us when things are
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.520]   going well and then when things are going bad he doesn't love us anymore
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.360]   that's a heresy it's wrong and you learned it from people who are
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:33.800]   instructing you about marriage God loves you and when you turn your back from him
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.000]   he still loves you and when you run from him he still loves you and when you look
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.400]   at porn he still loves you and when you have sex outside of marriage he's still
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.760]   loving and recklessly pursuing you and chasing you and running after you and
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:52.240]   calling you back to him that's how you love somebody in marriage that's what
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:57.560]   marriage looks like that's what it should look like that it is a picture of
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:02.920]   God's permanent commitment to us see the biggest theological problems of our day
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.240]   they're not that big they're not six-day creation or dinosaurs or crazy things
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.800]   like that predestination and dispensation on the transubstantiation
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:16.400]   all of these ten cent words what they are is simple it's God good and does he
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:22.360]   love me it's God good and does he love me and you've learned that he's not good
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:29.080]   and he doesn't love you and you learned it from marriage because you do not know
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:34.440]   an unbreakable marriage all you know the only reality you have the only worldview
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:40.480]   you know of marriage is breakable marriages let me explain the deep deep
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:46.360]   danger of this my kids we have this rope swing in the front yard hangs from this
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:51.240]   tree and they love it it's got this wooden kind of plate that they sit on
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.040]   and they swing and they push each other and it's it's fun for me as their father
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.080]   I sit in a rocking chair on the front porch and I just watch them playing and
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:03.240]   laughing giggle and swing each other and they have such a great time on this
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:09.680]   thing this gift the swing and one day the swing broke the wooden plate slipped
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:16.200]   off the rope and one of them fell and the others watched and from there on I
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:20.400]   couldn't get them to swing because as they looked at that thing that brought
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.560]   them life they just knew that it was breakable and they didn't want anything
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.320]   to do with it and I said no look I fixed it I repaired it look I it's not gonna
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.400]   fall off anymore and like no man what if we're way up there when it falls off I'm
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:39.040]   out on that you know and they only know the breakable version this is why
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.760]   marriage rates are declining because marriages are failing no-fault divorce
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:49.160]   enters the picture divorce goes rampant all you know is breakable marriage
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:56.080]   you're so impacted by this you don't even understand the consequences of the
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.000]   boiling waters around you as it relates to this you have to start with God's
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.880]   Word like you're on a deserted island and you have no idea what marriage is
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.960]   and you just say okay tell me what marriage is and you have nothing else to
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:13.680]   inform that not the experts of Hollywood
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:21.720]   to be united here the two becoming one flesh it literally means to be bonded
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:27.400]   together in a way that cannot be separated without deep consequences some
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.000]   of you have experienced this some of you have experienced this and you don't even
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.800]   realize that you've experienced that you're sitting in the deep consequences
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.000]   yesterday I saw this because this word is like glued together and there was a
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.200]   piece of foam glued to this board and as I ripped the foam apart parts of the
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.080]   foam stayed on the board and parts of the board went on the foam and it was
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:54.000]   just pieces left this is a picture of what happens when we give ourselves to
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.840]   someone to become one flesh and we separate it hurts we leave parts of us
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.640]   with them and parts of them with us and then we marry someone we have to explain
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.200]   that it's messy it was never intended to be that way and if that's your story
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:12.280]   it's my story there's certainly hope this is the beginning of the dating
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.320]   relationship series and so we're gonna spend time talking about that we'll
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.600]   spend an entire time talking about sex but I want to point out something to you
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:25.480]   have you noticed that I have not said that the reason for marriage is sex God
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.960]   is so pro-sex as I've said it's his idea it's his design it serves purposes for
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:35.400]   him the first command he gives a man is have lots of sex says be fruitful and
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.040]   multiply but that's what it means have lots of sex that's why I tell Monica it
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:46.720]   means anyways I'm like you don't use Hebrew let me explain it and then she's
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:53.680]   like you didn't go to seminary and I'm like oh no I forgot you knew that and so
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.880]   sex serves a purpose in marriage the enjoyment of it bonds two people
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:03.200]   together for a lifetime we're gonna talk about that bonding and messages ahead it
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.880]   also allows for life new life a new discipleship opportunity but can I tell
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:15.160]   you something marriage is not for sex sex is for marriage marriage is not for
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:21.480]   sex sex is a gift to marriage it serves a purpose in marriage and so many of you
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.280]   came into this room tonight and you thought that sex is ultimate and so much
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.280]   of what you think about marriage revolves around this idea of who you're
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.160]   gonna have sex with can I just give you some simple math if you have sex six
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:38.560]   times per month which is more than the average of once a week for 45 minutes
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:45.000]   per encounter which is generous I've been told
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:54.480]   that is listen that is point six to five percent of your marriage life it is not
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:02.360]   even 1% of the time that you spend in marriage so you better be great at a lot
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:10.360]   of other things you better be an amazing helper right you better understand the
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.560]   permanence of which God has created marriage for this sex it's a bonding
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.160]   agent it allows a physiological release that is the highest levels of dopamine
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:23.720]   that a person can experience apart from drugs it's God's creation and in a godly
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.880]   marriage you experience those high levels of dopamine without consequence
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:33.320]   without any consequence can you imagine being drunk with no hangover being coked
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:39.400]   out of your mind with no risk of a heart attack or a nosebleed being high with no
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:46.000]   risk of foggy brain being doing ecstasy with no worries of the depression that
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.120]   awaits or bleeding of the brain it's the highest levels of dopamine a person can
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.000]   naturally experience and in a godly marriage between two people committed to
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:02.160]   each other for a lifetime there's no downside it's a beautiful thing that God
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.720]   has given us as a gift but outside of marriage there are side effects so
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:15.080]   damaging that they shape our world our music our entertainment our culture our
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:22.960]   thoughts and they rewire us more on that weeks to come I will tell you lastly
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.840]   this bonding agent has implications for pornography for homosexuality for sexual
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:34.840]   abuse and for sex outside of marriage and we have to learn how to heal from
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.720]   this if this is your story we're gonna spend an entire week on how to heal and
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:45.560]   recovery from that which is necessary as you take on the project of marriage some
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.240]   of you tonight need to hear that marriage is good it's something that you
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.160]   don't want any part of and you need to hear no it's good God made it it's good
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.700]   some of you need to hear that marriage is hard you want it so bad you would
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:03.520]   risk venturing into that project with the wrong partner I need you to know in
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.680]   time it do not venture into that project with the wrong partner but everyone
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   needs to hear what it's for to find a helper to raise children according to
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:23.680]   God's plan and to display the the permanence of God's commitment and so
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:30.520]   how do you know if you are up for this project marriage and your singleness you
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:34.520]   have a helper in Jesus in your singleness you're spending your time
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:39.920]   making disciples and in your singleness you display a commitment to Jesus Christ
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.120]   his commands and rules for your life you walk in obedience to him what are you
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:51.080]   looking for in someone else someone who has a helper in Jesus's Holy Spirit
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:56.360]   someone who is passionate about making disciples and someone who displays their
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:02.720]   commitment to Jesus Christ through God's Word becoming God's man or woman this
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.000]   Saturday I'm doing a wedding and right before I came down to give you this
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.480]   message I was sitting in my computer and the couple emailed me their vows they
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.400]   had written their own and I read them for the first time it's it's a wedding
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:20.400]   of a dear friend of mine Garrett who pastors out there shepherds out there in
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.760]   Fort Worth and I read his vows and I just thought I would read them to you
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.320]   because this is the project of marriage it paints a picture he says Garrett
