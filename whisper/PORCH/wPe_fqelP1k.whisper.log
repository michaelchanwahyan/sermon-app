[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.960]   Before I walked up here, we sang a song and the song said, "You are awesome in this place."
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.960]   I want to tell you, I absolutely believe that is true, but listen, I also have to acknowledge
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960]   this.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.800]   Sometimes this place is not awesome.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.800]   Notice that's not what we sang.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.320]   We didn't say, "This place is awesome, mighty God."
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.560]   Because sometimes this place just, I think in the vernacular of the day, sucks is what
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.400]   you would say about this place.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.120]   There's a reason when we asked you all what it is that we wanted to talk about, what it
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.560]   is that we wanted to study and learn more of, or be reminded of, a disproportionate
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.720]   number of the responses were, "We want to know how to deal with anxiety and peace because
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.320]   this place is not awesome.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.280]   In fact, this place is freaking me out a little bit at times."
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.680]   And it can.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.800]   It can freak us out a lot.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.320]   It can fill our hearts with a lot of anxiety.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.920]   It can fill our hearts with a lot of sadness and despair.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.960]   And so where is this awesome, mighty God when I live in a world that frankly isn't rolling
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.280]   like I thought it would or thought it should or needed to for me to have peace?
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.920]   Well, I hope you were with us last week when David did a great job of talking through Matthew
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.600]   6 and Jesus talking about this issue of anxiety and how he was just pretty straightforward.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.880]   He said, "Listen, what I don't want you to do is ask for tomorrow's provision today.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.360]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.640]   You don't need tomorrow's provision today.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.280]   What you need to do today is seek the God who is awesome in this place.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.440]   Seek the God who is awesome everywhere that He is.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.360]   You need to meditate on His character, His nature.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.720]   You need to get to know His name and His history.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.600]   You need to know His resume, His CV, so that you can employ Him in every way in your life
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.720]   because anything other than that is going to wear you out.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.240]   And so today, with all of your strength, don't worry about tomorrow.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.720]   Tomorrow what you need to do is what you need to do today, which is seek first the kingdom
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.280]   of God and His righteousness and everything that you need will be given to you.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.580]   For tomorrow, it says in verse 34, will take care of itself.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.160]   Each day has enough trouble of its own.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.040]   What you need to do today is remind yourself of who God is.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.440]   And that is the only way that you will not experience anxiety.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.580]   It's the only way that you will not be overwhelmed with fear and despair.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.440]   Anything else, though it might temporarily numb your pain or temporarily distract you
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.160]   from your reality, everything else is going to be a temporary salve and it's frankly only
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.640]   going to continually increase trouble in your life because you're going to have to keep
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.660]   finding more and more things to distract you and numb you and you'll become more and more
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.000]   discouraged that everything you've tried isn't working and so you're going to wonder what
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.360]   could possibly work.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.920]   And what you will finally eventually do, if you're lucky, you'll get back to a place that
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   God said you should have started to from the very first time.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.440]   And that is you'll find yourself flat on your back.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.800]   And the great thing about being flat on your back is the only place that you can look is
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.820]   up.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.520]   And up is where our help comes from, the God who is awesome everywhere that He is.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.560]   Now let me just say this about God.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.920]   One of the characteristics about God is that He is omnipresent.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.380]   God is everywhere, okay?
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.480]   That doesn't mean that you can't kill a cockroach or kill an ant like Pantheist would tell you
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.800]   because God is in everything.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   No.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.200]   When we say that God is everywhere, what that means is the sovereign reality of God's perfection
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.160]   and goodness is sovereignly over everything, even this world that is not always an awesome
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   place.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.520]   Which, of course, begs an amazing question which is if God is so good and God is so kind,
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.460]   why is this world so unkind and so ungood?
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:23.240]   And if He is everywhere and His awesomeness is directly over everything, why is this world
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.620]   so screwed up?
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.560]   And frankly, why is my world so screwed up?
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.360]   That is a very fair question.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.720]   And it's one that I hope to answer tonight, not by really dealing with the specific problem
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.920]   of evil, but by telling you what God wants you to know and what He wants you to do so
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.880]   that you might have a peace that passes understanding.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.960]   Because here's the deal.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.200]   What worry is is a constant thinking that God's not going to get it right.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.160]   What bitterness and despair and depression is is a constant belief that God has already
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   got it wrong.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.080]   Let me say that again.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.120]   Worry is believing that God's not going to get it right.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.540]   And so what you've got to do is you eject from confidence and belief in Him and you
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.920]   enthrone yourself with some other strategy.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.560]   You try and meet a God-given need in a God-forbidden way or a God-given desire in a God-forbidden
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.600]   way.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.080]   And then next thing you know, you're going to find yourself lacking peace because God
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.560]   can't give you what doesn't exist apart from Him.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.360]   If He is the God of peace and you leave Him, you won't get peace.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.360]   So follow this.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.400]   That's why God says, "Don't you worry about what I'm going to do tomorrow.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.420]   I've got tomorrow.
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.880]   Focus on Me."
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.000]   That's why God describes Himself this way, "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.120]   Now whenever somebody introduces Himself that way, what you might want to do is go back
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.360]   and figure out who is Abraham, who is Isaac, who is Jacob?
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.760]   How did God deal with them?
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.520]   Was God faithful with them through every circumstance?
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.000]   Even when they weren't faithful, was God still faithful with them?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Did God come through?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.240]   Did God promise them something?
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.280]   And did He not eventually accomplish it?
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.720]   And the answer you will see is yes.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.200]   And so what God is doing is He's saying, "Hey, don't take My word for it.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.600]   Ask everybody that's ever followed Me."
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.880]   If you ever want to go to a church that's preaching a real short message, look for a
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.000]   pastor that the title of his message is, "The Mistakes and Apologies of God," because that's
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.720]   going to be a very short sermon.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.840]   There is none.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:29.200]   Because in addition to being omnipresent, we know that He is good.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.960]   And so why are we freaking out if God's awesome in this place and I'm in this place?
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.000]   And the answer is because we've got our eyes on this world that is not awesome.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.760]   God says, "By the way, you shouldn't be surprised this world is not awesome," because this place
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.920]   is not obeying the God who is awesome right here in this place.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.520]   So here's what I want to do just to start out.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.520]   Remind you of this.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.880]   Worry is us believing, and this is where it comes from.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.640]   Anxiety is us thinking that God is not going to get it right.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.240]   Bitterness and depression is us believing that God got it wrong or that we've done something
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.280]   so wrong God could never make it right.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.720]   And joy and peace, which is the opposite of anxiety and despair, joy and peace is the
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.680]   knowledge that God is sovereign, He is good, He is powerful, and He is intimately acquainted
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.880]   with your ways.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.900]   And that's really what I'm going to offer you tonight.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.040]   What God is going to say is, "Listen, the reason this world is so messed up is even
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.680]   though I'm here in the world and I want to do business with everybody and I want to share
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:33.240]   my promises and my perspective and give you my revelation so you can see what I see, what
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:41.920]   I'm up to, and why we are where we are in this very consistent Christian explanation
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.720]   for reality."
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.400]   That's what the Bible is.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:55.560]   It is the only working, not philosophy, but it's the only working revelation that we can
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.080]   say, "If that is true, then this world makes sense."
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.960]   And God can still be awesome even though this is not an awesome place.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.960]   So here's what I want to do.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.240]   I'm going to tell you the secret to dealing with your number one need, which according
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.560]   to you is anxiety and despair, fear and anxiousness, is having a real understanding that what we
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.360]   sang a minute ago is true and that as God you are awesome, period, and that you know
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.760]   me and that you love me.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.600]   And so even though I see things going on around me that would seem to indicate that either
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.360]   you're not sovereign over this moment or that you're not awesome if you are sovereign over
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.920]   this moment, I'm going to go back to what I know is true.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:41.840]   And I'm going to believe that you care about me and that if you inserted my name, the God
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:51.320]   of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Todd, that your resume would still be perfect.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.120]   And so what I want to do is introduce you to this God tonight.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.680]   Look, we've got to go back and we've got to believe what Jeremiah 29 11 says.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.680]   Now watch.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.400]   I'm going to just quote to you Jeremiah 29 11 first where God says, "For I know the plans
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.680]   that I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to give you a future and a hope, plans for
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.840]   welfare and not for calamity."
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.280]   Which when you hear that verse, you go, "Man, cool, I will chill."
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.160]   That's why so many of us, if you have ever picked the favorite Bible verse, love Jeremiah
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.160]   29 11.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.560]   Oh man, that just, is that true Todd?
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.280]   That there's a God and his plans for me to give me a future and a hope?
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.200]   And his plans for me are for welfare?
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.360]   Oh man, why didn't somebody tell me that?
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.600]   Because now I can sleep, now I can stop freaking out about what I've done or what's going to
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   happen.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.760]   All right, and let me just say this to you.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:47.600]   I hate to ruin your favorite Bible verse by putting it in context, but you need to see
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.080]   the context of that verse.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.780]   That is God telling people who are not just filled with anxiety and dread, their world
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:04.200]   is a result of them not knowing God and walking with God and rejecting God as the source of
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.120]   their provision, protection and peace.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.880]   And therefore, they are not having a very good day, their future doesn't look all that
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:16.920]   bright, their hope is gone, and they've got no welfare and nothing but calamity.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:23.320]   That's what Jeremiah, and God's over there going, "Yoo-hoo, over here.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.240]   For I can tell you what I've got over here, but you've rejected me and so even though
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.520]   I'm awesome everywhere I am and I'm sovereign over there, I'm choosing to let you have what
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.560]   you have chose.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.280]   And I'm awesome in that place over there too.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:43.820]   I don't, you don't need to be physically over here, you need to be by faith related to me
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.880]   and walking in my ways."
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.720]   Let me just insert this to you because I want to tell you that nobody, I don't at least,
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:11:02.640]   I don't look at you and scoff at you because you're anxious or fearful or sometimes despairing.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:10.680]   Probably arguably the most brilliant theologian of the previous century felt the exact same
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   way.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.760]   And you go, "Well wait a minute, Todd, that seems really bizarre to me because you're
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.320]   up there and you're going to try and tell us tonight how we cannot be this person that
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.640]   is like everybody else in this world which is overwhelmed and despairing and anxious
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.800]   and you just told me the guy that knows more about God and who's probably done more to
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:33.960]   reveal who God is through creative narratives and storytelling and just incredible intellect
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:39.400]   and rationale, that guy felt like I forgot that God forgot him and he was despairing?"
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.640]   Yes, I'm going to read you from his journal.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:47.200]   Now look, if that guy was alive, there was about three decades of his life that he couldn't
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.440]   come to the porch even though he was single because the guy was 50 and still single, never
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.680]   had married.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:05.480]   And finally, finally, after 50 years of chaste life, he came to know God later in his life.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.880]   He wasn't a believer all those days but he lived a chaste life and eventually found a
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:15.280]   woman that he absolutely loved and he married her.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.440]   And by the way, now he knew Christ and he was writing these amazing works, actually
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:26.000]   doing radio programs broadcast all over England at the time that were just radically transforming
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.160]   his culture and you think if God's going to be nice and kind to anybody, it'd be this
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160]   guy.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:39.720]   Well, four years in to finally finding a woman he loves, he loses her to cancer.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   And so that's going to shake him to the core and he starts despairing.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.080]   And this is what he writes, he says, "Meanwhile, where is God?"
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.840]   This is one of the most disquieting symptoms of going through pain like this, of grief.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.760]   When you're happy, so happy that you have no sense of needing him, so happy that you're
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.200]   tempted to feel his claims upon you as an interruption, if you remember yourself and
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.720]   turn to him with gratitude and praise, you will be, or at least so it feels, welcome
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.860]   with open arms.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.200]   But go to him when your need is desperate, when all other help is in vain, and what do
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   you find?
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.560]   A door slammed in your face.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.420]   A sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.420]   After that, silence.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.600]   You may as well turn away.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.920]   The longer you wait, the more emphatic the silence will become.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.280]   There are no lights in the windows.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.600]   It might be an empty house.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   Was it ever inhabited?
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.560]   It seemed so once, and that seeming was as strong as this.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.560]   What can this mean?
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:36.760]   Why is God so present a commander in our time of prosperity and so very absent a help in
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:42.040]   time of trouble?
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   What a great question.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:48.320]   Can I just start by just saying this?
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:54.720]   Being tempted to believe that God is not awesome is not sin.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:01.240]   I'm constantly tempted to believe that God is not awesome in this place or awesome at
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.760]   all.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:08.480]   Now what you do with that temptation is going to make the difference between whether or
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.560]   not you're going to be a person who walks out of here tonight and lives in a peace that
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.880]   passes understanding or if you take that bait based on what you see and what you're experiencing
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.040]   and you snap on that and you go, "You know what?
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.040]   God isn't good.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.040]   God's word isn't true.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.040]   God can't be trusted.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.960]   Disobeying him has got to be better than obeying him."
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:32.720]   Because you feel like he's forgotten you, then you will continually be anxious and I'm
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.240]   going to prove it to you tonight.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.000]   God won't be mad at you, but he's just going to keep saying not your favorite Bible verse,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.280]   but God's favorite thing to remind you of, which is I know how you're feeling.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.960]   I know what you're going through.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.160]   Listen, by the way, the reason you're going through that is because you're not enjoying
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.120]   me, the God who is awesome.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.640]   If you were, you would know who I am.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.680]   You know my plan for you is to give you a future and a hope.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.840]   See, the Bible says this.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.960]   The Bible says that we don't grieve as those who have no hope.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.000]   What I want you to understand what's implied there.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.240]   What's implied there is that you do get to grieve.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.000]   C.S. Lewis is the guy that I'm talking about, the guy who wrote Chronicles of Narnia, the
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.600]   guy who wrote Mere Christianity, the guy who wrote this book I'm reading from called The
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.280]   Grief Observed.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.880]   C.S. Lewis grieved.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.400]   Those were deep words of grief.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.320]   Now what's really unfair, what I just did is I cut him off.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.080]   What he did is he sat down and he was honest to God.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.320]   See, God's a big boy.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   He's a father.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.320]   I'm a dad.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.320]   I got six kids.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.280]   I understand sometimes my kids don't know what I know.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.840]   They haven't lived the life that I've lived.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.400]   They don't have the information that I have.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.160]   Sometimes they are not happy with me and they don't want to trust me.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.760]   In fact, they're railing in all their adolescent rage against my counsel or against even at
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:02.640]   times my sovereign awesomeness to keep them from being idiots.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.760]   When I say, "Listen, your daddy is awesome in this place," they go, "No, he's not.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.560]   If he was awesome, my friends would think I was a geek.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.080]   My friends would not be having fun at the party tonight and I wouldn't be," and on and
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.520]   on and on it might go.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:21.200]   Because Lord knows everybody else is doing it, right?
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.960]   They seem to be getting away with it, whatever it is, and having a heck of a time.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.880]   As they get older, by the way, I do what any loving father does.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.240]   I don't rule their life in the exact same way.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.240]   I've trained them.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.880]   I've done everything I can to show them my character, my nature, that it's not for me
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.520]   that I give them these instructions, it's because I love them and I give them freedom.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.440]   Sometimes I've got to say, "How's that working out over there?
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.240]   I know the plans I have for you.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.320]   My plans were to give you a future and a hope.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.640]   My plans for welfare, not for calamity, but I'm going to love you enough that the only
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.080]   way that you can learn is through calamity, then go through learning through calamity."
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.480]   Let me just tell you guys something.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.400]   Experience isn't a masterful teacher.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.940]   It's just a very expensive one.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.820]   Some of you guys in this room know that the world does not give you what it says it's
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.820]   going to give you for long.
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.040]   You've learned that the hard way.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.700]   Even though God told you from the beginning that he's where life is, some of you go, "I
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.660]   think I'll see if there's life somewhere else."
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.660]   You know what, man?
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.260]   That rocket ride starts pretty good at the beginning, but inevitably, inevitably you
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.140]   come back and you go, "This isn't all it's cranked up to be."
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.860]   They don't show you the end of the story a lot in those music videos or in those movie
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:38.260]   scenes, or my friends that have bragged about all their experiences haven't told me about
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:45.900]   the still of the night and the pain of the heart.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.940]   See the story I read from C.S. Lewis was just page one of an entire journal entry where
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:56.580]   he continued to tell his father how he felt, but he stayed there and let his father speak
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.580]   to him.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:05.380]   I'm going to tell you one of the keys to dealing with your anxiety and one of the keys
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:11.980]   to dealing with your pain and with your sadness is to learn to trust in the revelation and
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.980]   the word of God.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.380]   One of the things that you have to do as you begin to really struggle is to remember in
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.600]   your questioning to quietly listen.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:30.660]   In your wrestling, remember revelation, things that God has already told you and explained
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.660]   to you.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.180]   This is an amazing verse in Isaiah chapter 40.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.980]   It just says this, "Why do you assert, O Jacob," by the way, I'm going to tell you just a little
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.740]   bit more about Jeremiah 29, but in Isaiah 40 he's talking to the exact same people that
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.700]   he's talking to there in Jeremiah 29.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.860]   It says, "Why do you say, O Jacob," it's the name for the nation of Israel, "Why do you
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.980]   assert that my way is hidden from the Lord and that justice dubious escapes the notice
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:50.980]   of my God?"
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.980]   Why would you ever say that?
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.980]   Have you ever said that?
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:58.020]   Not in those same kind of poetic words where you go, "God, why have you not noticed me?
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.460]   Why does the justice do me escape you?
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:05.820]   If you're awesome, why is my life the way that it is?"
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.900]   This is what the scriptures say, the prophet Isaiah says, "Do you not know?
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.900]   Have you not heard?
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.560]   The everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, he does not become
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:24.420]   weary or tired, his understanding is inscrutable, he is awesome in this place.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:29.300]   He gives strength to the weary and to him who lacks might, he increases power, though
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:39.060]   youth grow weary and tired and vigorous young men, porch going young men stumble badly.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.260]   Yet those who wait for the Lord," you see that word right there?
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.940]   That's the word that you're going to have to learn to embrace if you want to deal with
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.440]   your anxiety.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:55.260]   Those who wait for the Lord will not be anxious, they'll gain new strength.
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.660]   They're going to mount up on wings like eagles.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.660]   What do eagle's wings do?
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:03.300]   They catch that little, they catch that air and it just pulls them up.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.660]   They'll mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they won't be
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.980]   despairing people.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.460]   They will walk and not become weary.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.980]   See that's not your story, you might go, "Todd, I'm anxious, I'm weary, I'm 26, I'm single,
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.060]   it's been a long time since I've had a date.
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.940]   I don't know if I can wait until I'm 50 to get married so that my wife dies in four years
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.100]   so I can be angry at God again."
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:32.900]   Well, I want you to wait until you're 50 to get married, I want you to wait today on God.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.860]   I want you to really wait and see what he says he is.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.540]   I want you to tune in, are you ready?
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:43.860]   Now let me just take one more second, I want to explain to you what is going on in Jeremiah
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:49.260]   chapter 29 because in Jeremiah chapter 29 again, the context of this passage is the
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:55.100]   reason that you're filled with despair Israel and filled with anxiety is because you have
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.220]   rejected me.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.140]   This is the context, this is the verses around your favorite Bible verse.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.900]   In Jeremiah 29 10, "For thus says the Lord God, when 70 years have been completed for
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:11.000]   Babylon," in other words, there's going to be a season where you're going to experience
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.740]   life without me because that's the only way you're going to really learn that I'm good,
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.500]   you won't believe me while you're here.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.460]   By the way, you can be at church for a long time just like my buddy JP said earlier tonight,
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.580]   "I was around church for a long time but I was never in relationship with the awesome
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.580]   God."
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:30.780]   Right, you've heard all the silly analogies, just because you come to a church doesn't
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.040]   mean you're an abiding Christian anymore than sleeping in your garage tonight won't make
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:39.020]   you a car.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:44.440]   There's got to be some characteristic about you in that garage that makes you a car and
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:49.800]   there has to be some characteristic about you in this place that will make you an abiding
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:57.680]   Christ follower which is the person who is peace that passes understanding.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.600]   What he's saying is you're here with me Israel, you're in this land filled with milk and honey,
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.840]   this land where the temple is but you haven't been walking with me, you don't know me and
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.240]   you have not observed my commandments and so God's going to let them have the consequences
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.480]   of not knowing him.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.320]   In this case, it was being driven away from that land for 70 years and he says after you're
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:22.320]   there for 70 years and you realize that every other option for peace can't be found, you're
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.000]   going to come back and maybe go, "Maybe we should try listening to the God we've always
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   known about."
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:37.840]   And he says this in verse 12, "Then you will call upon me and come to me and pray to me
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.840]   and I will listen to you."
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.440]   In other words, this is what you need to really remind yourself, okay?
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:50.120]   When you're despairing, you got to go, listen, my favorite Bible verse is Jeremiah 29 and
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   11 which says, "I know the plans you have for me," says the Lord, "plans to give you
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:59.720]   a future and a hope, plans for welfare and a calamity if I repent of my trying to find
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.500]   life and peace apart from him.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.600]   If I return to him and meditate on him and I stop worrying about what's going to happen
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:11.240]   to me tomorrow or the next day and today I seek first God and his kingdom and his righteousness,
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.540]   then he tells me I will experience that."
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:19.700]   That is a verse that is calling you to return and to repent.
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.520]   Verse 13 just continues to emphasize this, "You will seek me and you will find me when
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.320]   you search me with all your heart."
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.520]   What did Jesus say was the key to not having anxiety?
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.880]   See, this is why Jesus was so brilliant.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.880]   He knew his Bible.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.520]   People go, "Well, how do I deal with anxiety?"
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.240]   He goes, "Well, seek first God and his kingdom, man."
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.240]   He didn't say go to church.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.760]   He didn't say be in a community group.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:45.480]   He said, "Listen, use your community to remind you of the goodness of God.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.760]   Be in a church that calls you to abide with the God that they sing about and talk about."
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.160]   And then it says in verse 14, "I will be found by you," declares the Lord.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.640]   "I will restore you.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.640]   I will restore your fortunes.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.440]   I will gather you from all the nations, from all the places where I have driven you," declares
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.440]   the Lord.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.680]   "I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you."
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   Here's the truth.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.360]   Sometimes, I just need to let you know, sometimes your anxiety is not a sign of your insanity,
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.880]   it's a sign of your reality.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.200]   I mean, one of the things you need to know is that sometimes God gives you over to anxiety
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.560]   so that you might go, "What I'm doing is not working."
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.560]   Now here's the problem.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:31.680]   You live in a world that wants to keep you from going anywhere but to God.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   This world does not call you to repent.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.640]   That's just way too old-fashioned.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.720]   So the world's smarter than God.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   And so what the world says is, "Take this pill.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:50.320]   What we gotta do is just mix the cocktail, the pharmaceuticals that we give you, or maybe
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.600]   sex isn't enough so we gotta spice it up.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:03.060]   And if you have sex this way, then you'll start to really find life.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.240]   Or maybe it's your career, or maybe it's your current boyfriend or girlfriend, or maybe
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   it's your current spouse.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.480]   Let's just hit reset on that and go somewhere else."
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.240]   In the world, mostly though, when you finally try all those things and you're still sad,
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.280]   you'll go see a doctor, "Doctor, I don't know what's wrong with me."
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.480]   And he'll say, "Look, take this and you'll feel better."
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.040]   And you might feel better, but here's the thing, you're just masking the pain.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.760]   You're dealing with an infection, not with an antibiotic, but with a painkiller, and
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.260]   that leaves the infection there.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.560]   The Bible says that sometimes we are where we are because of the choices that we make.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.640]   See if this doesn't sound like a person who is depressed.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.520]   This is a guy named David.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.520]   It's in Psalm 32.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.520]   He says, "I'm gonna tell you what, you know who the blessed guy is?
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.240]   The blessed guy is the guy whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered by the awesome
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.360]   God.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.160]   How blessed is that man to whom the Lord does not give what he deserves to him."
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.520]   That's what impute iniquity means.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.480]   "In whose spirit there is no deceit."
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.000]   In other words, his spirit is inclined towards truth, not error.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.800]   David said, "Let me just tell you my story.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:16.120]   When I was silent about my sin, my body wasted away through my groaning all day long."
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   Do you know anybody like that?
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:23.880]   By the way, you might be that guy where you're just kinda like, "Oh, my job, my boyfriend,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:31.600]   my body image, my career, my story, my history, my parents, my family of origin."
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.820]   He says, "For day and night, your hand was heavy upon me.
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:41.320]   My vitality was drained away as with a fever heat of summer.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.600]   But then I acknowledged my sin to you and my iniquity I did not hide.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.840]   I said, 'I'm gonna confess that I've been trying to figure out how to do life without
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.840]   you God and you forgave me.'"
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.320]   See, there's a word, Selah, that's in there.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.960]   Before that he said, "Do you remember how bad life was?"
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.680]   And he just stops right there.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   That Selah means pause, just sit and remember and meditate.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.720]   It's why I tell a lot of people who come to me that I talk to who are really struggling,
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.320]   I go, "Hey, man, you know what you need to do?
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:13.000]   You need to go home right now and you need to journal how lonely and filled with self-hate
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.840]   and despair you are."
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:23.040]   Because believe it or not, believe it or not, if you listen to me and you respond to God,
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:29.120]   there's gonna be a day that you forget how bad it is to turn away from him.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:37.080]   And you have to be able to go back and read your own testimony of anxiousness and fear
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.520]   and despairing when you leave God.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.200]   I know you think you'll never forget this, but I'm gonna tell you something, you will
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.800]   forget this pain, you will forget this guilt, you will forget this shame.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.120]   Don't waste the pain.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.480]   Write it down right now.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.200]   That's called Selah, just sit in it.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.440]   But then he says, "But then I also acknowledge my sin to God and my iniquity I did not hide,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.560]   I confess and God forgave me."
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.920]   And then you just go, you go meditate on that, man, that God says, "You're forgiven, I'm
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.920]   not angry at you."
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.280]   See, here's the deal with my kids, I just had this conversation this week with one of
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.600]   my children, I said, "I'm not mad, man, you won't believe how quickly I want to restore
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.600]   all the relationship.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:22.240]   I'm just looking for humility, I'm just looking for honest, broken, contrite hearts.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.040]   I can work with that."
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.880]   I want to turn this judgment that I've got to leave you in into blessing and you won't
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.160]   believe how quickly I want to turn it into blessing.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.480]   That's what God's saying to you tonight.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.640]   He knows where you've been, you don't have to manage that information, He already knows.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.320]   You just got to go, "God, this isn't working out."
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.480]   He goes, "I know it's not working out.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.160]   This is not a good day, I know it's not a good day."
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.600]   And God's over here, "Return to me, come."
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.240]   And He's ready to start working with you.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.080]   Now listen, that doesn't mean that there's not some things you got to deal with that
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.400]   are real, but He said, "Let's start to deal with them."
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.800]   And you're going to find that I'll even take this darkest, saddest part of your life and
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.640]   I will redeem it.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.280]   I'll use it for good.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.680]   And I didn't need you to do that so I could turn it to good, but watch, this is what I
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   do.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.880]   I take ashes and I make them beautiful.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.720]   I take what you intended for evil and I use it for glory.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.360]   That's what God does and only God can do.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.000]   David just says, "Therefore man, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   might be found.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.400]   But if you are in the flood of great waters, you will not reach Him."
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:33.800]   The truth is, is sometimes God is just, He's like the prodigal father.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.320]   You're waiting on Him to rescue you, but here's what God does.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.640]   God stands there and He tells you where He is.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.320]   And He says, "Come, come."
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.840]   And He'll whisper to you, "I'm there, I'm not mad at you.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.200]   You know, you're my daughter, you're beautiful.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.840]   I know, there you are again in somebody else's arms trying to find meaning and acceptance,
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.720]   just come here, come to me."
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:57.240]   And God will run to you and He'll run to you in whispers.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.400]   I had a guy who came to me one time and I mean, this guy was not just struggling with
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.880]   anxiety, I mean this guy had an anxiety disorder that was off the charts.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.160]   He had all kinds of medications that he was taking.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.400]   He could hardly get out of his house.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.720]   He couldn't hold a job because on any given day he'd be so freaked out that he was going
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:20.000]   to die or something awful was going to happen to him that he couldn't exercise, he couldn't
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.880]   hardly eat, he couldn't function as a normal human.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.800]   And we had a mutual friend and his friend said, "What would you say to him?"
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.040]   I go, "I'll tell you exactly what I'd say to him."
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.320]   I mean, just let me ask you this, who does he know that really loves the Lord and does
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   he know the Lord?
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   He goes, "No, he's got no relationship with God."
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.840]   I go, "I know what I'd say to him, just drive him over."
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.360]   And so he drove this guy over and he sat down with me.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.360]   I said, "Tell me your story."
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.200]   And this guy was scared to death.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.240]   He goes, "Well, I mean, Todd, I tried to even drive myself.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.920]   I didn't want my friend to have to drive me, but I got out to my car and I started it and
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.520]   I turned it off and I ran back upstairs."
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.520]   He said, "My life's a mess."
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.920]   And he went on and on and on and on.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.560]   I go, "Well, what are you scared of?
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.760]   What's got you so anxious?"
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.880]   And then he went on to tell me and I just said, "Can I just tell you something, bro?
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   You're not insane.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.580]   You're the only sane person I know.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.200]   You just got through telling me you don't believe there's a God.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.920]   You just got through telling me you don't believe if there's a God that he's good.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.800]   You just got through telling me that you've got nothing in this world but yourself to
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.000]   hope in."
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:26.600]   That ought to make you absolutely frozen in fear and despair because I got to tell you
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.880]   something, every single one of you guys, you see God's put eternity in your hearts and
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   you know that one day you're going to come to an end.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.720]   He's put mortality in your mirror.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.760]   You see that you're dying.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.600]   And what everyone else in the world tries to do, they try and kick the can down the
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.440]   road and they try and ignore this reality.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.360]   And I'm just telling you, I told that guy, I go, "Listen, man, you're the only sane atheist
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.320]   I know.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.120]   Every other atheist I know is still trying to convince themselves that life is good,
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:58.920]   that judgment's not real, that they can find life apart from a God that really does exist
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.880]   and that says life is only found in Him and that everybody else has always failed to find
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.080]   true meaning and peace in everything the world offers, that they're going to be the first
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   one that finds it."
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.840]   Those are the people that are crazy.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.720]   You, my friend, are sane.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:16.080]   The problem is in your sanity and your awareness of the despairing state of being a mortal
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.120]   man who stands in judgment before a holy God is you're not doing what a really wise man
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:27.160]   would do, which is to avail yourself to His mercy.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.800]   And bro, I got to tell you, I think if you'll do that, I think you'll see everything change.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   And let me just tell you about that guy.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   He's not mad at you.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   He loves you.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:41.560]   And he wants you to come out of this 70 years of exile and return to him.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:48.440]   See, I want to tell you that's what God wants for you.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   And this happens to all of us.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   It happens to C.S. Lewis.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   It's going to happen to me tonight.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:57.360]   There's going to be a time when I move into this exile, this Babylonian place where something's
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.960]   not going the way that I want and I'm going to start to move away from God's not good,
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.840]   God can't be trusted, God's word's not true, and I'm going to start to have my world melt
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.320]   around me and God's going to say, "Todd, return to me.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.440]   Listen, remember, I'm a good God.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.440]   I've got good plans.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   I've got welfare.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.440]   I've got future.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.440]   I've got hope.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.440]   But you're going to have to trust me.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.440]   Okay, your feelings are real.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.440]   What you see is real.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.000]   But listen, gang, can I just say this to you?
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Feelings are real.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.800]   They're just not reliable.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   They're not reliable.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:31.480]   Let me read you this.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.360]   I got this prayer request not long ago.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.720]   It's from a mom.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:41.360]   She said, "My precious son, raised in the Lord, I believe called to ministry, gifted
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.400]   and anointed.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.480]   He was baited with the temptation of lust at an early age.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:53.000]   He was later lured into a relationship and then sought counsel from a leader at his school
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:01.160]   who instead of calling him to repentance, encouraged him to explore and trust his flesh
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.560]   all the more.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:10.080]   This leader comforted him and had many deep conversations with him and said that she had
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.480]   similar torment until she trusted her own flesh and followed her own lifestyle choices
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:21.240]   and urged him to be himself and to not live for anybody else.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.720]   My son ultimately chose to strengthen himself in the Lord.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.320]   He received biblical counsel.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:32.720]   He resisted for a time, but later he began dabbling in pornography unbeknownst to us
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:38.520]   as well as alternate solutions to his pain.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.520]   When he learned to drive, he gave in to the temptation and he wholeheartedly entered into
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.600]   more and more illicit relationships.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.080]   Social media at that point increasingly began to tell the story of his struggles and decline
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.880]   into sin and death.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.040]   And waves of well-meaning Christian friends sometimes encouraged him and celebrated his
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:07.160]   exploring all of life and bravery in pursuing freedom and who he really was.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.880]   Our hearts broke.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.200]   Words utterly failed how we felt at this time.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.320]   We told him that we could not continue to allow him to make these choices, that we had
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.600]   raised him in truth, we wanted to walk in that truth.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.640]   He insisted that we not even mention any of that ever again.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.040]   We could not be silent and he left.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:34.240]   At times he would come home in anger because we would not just endorse his choices, but
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.540]   we kept seeking godly counsel and increasingly held him accountable for his choices all the
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.720]   while reminding him that we loved him.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   Since then, watch this, our son has transformed into this person that he has never been.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.120]   He had always been kind and generous, hilarious.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.760]   Now he's moody, now he's cross, now he's miserable, now he's anxious, now he's angry.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.860]   He's also begun drinking and I believe using drugs.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.820]   My husband and our other three children have shown unconditional, nonjudgmental love throughout
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.240]   this devastating season.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.200]   When he calls, we mostly listen.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.040]   Sometimes he will go to dinner with us.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.320]   Rarely will he ever come home and if he does, it's only for very short visits.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:19.560]   All of this to say, someone, someone from your church has recently reached out to him
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.840]   and been a faithful witness to him.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.900]   Our son's battling a lot of emotional issues.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.900]   He believes that he's bipolar.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:30.740]   Let me just tell you something, this kid is not bipolar.
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.880]   He's not bisexual.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.440]   This kid is struggling, in my opinion, because he wants to continue to try and find peace
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:43.360]   apart from God and that anxiety is sanity.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360]   Because he knows the truth.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.960]   He's tried to find life in this for a long time and it doesn't give him life.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.080]   It just gives him more sadness.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:57.800]   Even though there's moments of euphoria and escape from his pain, there are seasons of
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   despair.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.320]   That will make you very anxious.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.840]   The world's solution is gonna say, "No, no, man.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.440]   "Let's take some of this and we can numb that pain."
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   It's not God's solution.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.440]   What is God's solution?
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.960]   Here's God's solution, be honest.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.600]   Just like C.S. Lewis was, but watch, stick in there.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.080]   What I'm gonna do is I don't have time to read you the rest of a grief observance, it's
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.480]   like 100 pages, but what I wanna tell you where C.S. Lewis got his idea.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.480]   You ready?
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.480]   It's in Psalm 13.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.480]   Here's what I want you to know.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.600]   This is what you gotta remember.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:31.720]   Remember in all your questioning and all your anxious wondering, remember to quietly listen.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.640]   Here's David again.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.040]   And I want you to listen to the way David talks to the father.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:44.880]   And I want you to know as a father, I don't have any trouble sometimes with my kids sobbing
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.800]   and go, "God, how long, man?
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.120]   "How long are the popular kids who are compromising "in every way you told me I should, how long
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:57.800]   "are they gonna prosper and I'm gonna feel this deep pain "in my heart, how long?"
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.280]   And I just get to hold them.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.880]   I get to remind them of their beauty and dignity and their value.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.480]   And they go, "Yeah, yeah, you're just my dad, "you've gotta say that."
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.280]   Just like, "Yeah, yeah, God, I know you feel that way."
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.640]   I just wanna experience that here a little bit.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   Watch David.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.800]   He says this, "How long, oh Lord, "will you forget me forever?
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.960]   "How long will you hide your face from me?
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.840]   "How long shall I take counsel in my own soul?
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.240]   "How, having sorrow in my heart all the day, "how long will my enemy be exalted over me?"
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.920]   Now think about this, this is somebody talking to God.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   This is a man of God's own heart.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.800]   Consider, it's another way to say, "How long, and you answer me, oh Lord, my God,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   "enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death, "and my enemy will say, 'I've overcome
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.440]   him,' "and my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken."
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.920]   See, I love this, I love what David does here.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.360]   He does what anybody who would know that there's a loving father there would do, who has awesome
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.920]   understanding in ways that we don't have.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.680]   He just goes to him, he says, "God, I'm not happy.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.000]   "I don't like what's going on.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   "How long is it going to be this way?"
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.880]   But watch what David did, it's what C.S. Lewis did, it's what you've gotta do if you really
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.480]   want to learn how to not live an anxious, sad, despairing life.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:10.160]   You gotta shut up and listen.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.920]   Sometimes people will come to me and they'll go, they'll just say, "Hey Todd, let me ask
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   you a question.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.920]   "What in the world were you thinking?
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.920]   "What were you doing?
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.640]   "Why did you execute that way?
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.200]   "I mean, who would have possibly thought that was the right thing to do?
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.280]   "I can't believe that when you were confronted with that opportunity and situation, that's
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   what you did.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.360]   "It makes no sense to me whatsoever.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.400]   "I just don't understand you."
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.480]   Boom, shut the door and walk away.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:45.600]   Now, when that happens, I usually open the door and go, "Sweetie, come here, all right?"
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:55.320]   My wife doesn't come at me that way, but let's just say somebody did.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.080]   Would you go, "Well Todd, they asked you a question.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.480]   "They did exactly what Psalm 13 says."
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.560]   'Cause here's the thing, that person, if they did what I said they did, which is what?
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.520]   What'd they do at the very end of that howlongingness?
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.360]   What'd I say they did?
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:13.560]   Slam the door and walked away.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.160]   You see, when you do that, you're not asking God.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.080]   You're just there to deliver a message.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.160]   You are incompetent and you are accusing God of not being good, his word not being true,
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.360]   and disobeying him has gotta be better than hanging out with his awesomeness.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.440]   Boom, I'm done with you and I'm on my own way.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.120]   It's not what C.S. Lewis did.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.920]   It's not what David did.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.680]   What David did right there is he stopped and there's a word, it's in verse five, the word
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   is "but."
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.680]   It's a word of contrast.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.800]   He said, "But," in verse five, "I have trusted in your loving kindness."
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:54.200]   The word for loving kindness is your covenant promise.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:58.880]   He went back to the promise of God and he meditated on it.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.960]   He said, "My heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.800]   I will sing to the Lord because he is bound to flee with me."
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:15.040]   David sat, that's just two short verses, after all of his ranting, okay, he just stopped.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.080]   And he just went back and he reminded himself of what is true.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.200]   He goes, "It doesn't look like God's good.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   It doesn't look like he's awesome, but I know he's awesome.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   I know he's the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   What'd you do with Abraham?
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.200]   How'd you do with Isaac?
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   What about Jacob?
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   How'd you do with him?
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   Boy, God, it doesn't look like you ever let them go.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.560]   Boy, there were some seasons in there, but I see what you're doing now.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.480]   I get to look back and I see you maketh no mistakes."
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:47.240]   Now, you can abandon that God because he doesn't work in your timetable, or you can go, "I'm
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.840]   gonna wait."
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.480]   Because by the way, I've learned from experience going over there, it works for a season, but
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:55.440]   it makes you feel worse.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:01.440]   This is exactly, by the way, what you would expect Jesus to have done.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:08.120]   Jesus himself, and I'll show you at the very end of what I'm about to do in just a moment,
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:12.520]   had a very Psalm 13 moment.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.320]   Jesus was always confronted.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.040]   And by the way, I love Hebrews chapter four in verse 15.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:26.120]   It says, "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:32.880]   but we have one who has been tempted in everything as we have been and yet is without sin.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.280]   So therefore, let us draw with confidence to the throne of grace that we might receive
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.200]   mercy and find grace to help us in a time of need."
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.560]   In other words, Jesus knows what it's like to go, "God, how long, man?
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.160]   How long is this gonna go down?
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:55.120]   How long until you answer me?
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.240]   My enemies, if you don't do something soon, they're gonna say, 'I've overcome him, and
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.800]   my adversaries will rejoice while I am shaken.'"
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.120]   And so I love this little story in Matthew chapter four.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:10.040]   It's when Jesus, it says, watch this, in Matthew four, "And Jesus was led by the Spirit."
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.200]   In other words, the awesome God goes, "Come here, let me take you in my awesomeness to
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   this desert."
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.960]   And what did the Spirit of God do?
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.400]   He led him into a wilderness, and there he was tempted by the devil.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.200]   I'm gonna show you exactly how he was tempted by the devil, and guess what?
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.040]   It's the exact same way Adam was tempted in paradise.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.520]   What you're about to see here is the contrast between what a godly man does and an ungodly
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.520]   man does.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:39.400]   What you're about to see here is how Jesus, in a desert, with no provision, does the right
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.280]   thing and at least a blessing, where man, in the perfect place, with all the comforts
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.840]   in the world, does the wrong thing and at least a curse.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:52.460]   So he's in the desert, and it says that he fasted for 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.120]   And I love the Bible, it's so full of exaggerations, it says, "And he became hungry."
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.120]   Okay?
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:04.160]   So, by the way, I'm talking to my single friends, and so I know some of you guys are 24 and
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.160]   you're still virgins.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.440]   I mean, way to go, all right?
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.440]   Right?
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.440]   You've not really just dove in.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.360]   I don't mean that too sarcastically, although I'm gonna be sarcastic in just a second, all
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.360]   right?
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:21.480]   Some of you guys are 28, some of you guys are 34, and you're still virgins.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.480]   Wow.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.760]   Here's what I want you to do.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:29.880]   I want you to say, "I'm not gonna eat for 40 days."
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.760]   And then what I'm gonna do is, whoever you are, you know, when you're, right now, at
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.520]   the beginning of your 40-day fast, guys, just write down whoever the girl of your dreams
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.520]   is, okay?
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.960]   I'm gonna deliver her naked to your bed in 40 days, okay?
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:48.240]   And I'm gonna put a Big Mac next to her.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:54.280]   I'm gonna say, "Which one?
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   What are you up for?"
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.280]   All right?
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:03.880]   Now, the reason I do that is because you go, "Well, Jesus can't relate to me being a virgin.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.880]   He died when he was 33.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   I'm 35 years old."
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:13.320]   Let's do the 40-day Big Mac test, all right?
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.040]   And so here's the deal.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.520]   He's in the wilderness.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.520]   It's 40 days.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.000]   And then the enemy shows up and goes, "Hey, man, are you nuts?
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   I know who you are."
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.400]   By the way, if you ever wanna see good theology, read what demons say about Jesus.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:29.480]   "You're the holy one of God who will judge us at the end of time.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.800]   I know who you are."
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.920]   Because they live in the spirit realm.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.880]   They see what we don't see.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.960]   They say, "He walks up to you, 'I know who you are, bro.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.680]   You're part of the Trinity.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.880]   You're the one that volunteered to come down here on this mission to redeem the world.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.000]   And your father said he'd watch over you.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.480]   He'd watch over you.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.000]   And the spirit said he would guide you.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.680]   He guided you, bro, right in the wilderness for 40 days."
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.560]   How's the ambrosia of the gods working out for you here?
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.720]   Let me tell you what's going on.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:59.000]   Your daddy is up there partying, eating your portion of the eternal meal, and he's forgotten
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.060]   all about you.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.280]   So what you need to do, bro, is you need to seize this life by the horns.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.560]   In other words, break the terms of the incarnation.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.640]   Don't live as Todd Wagner has to live as a finite man.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.320]   Even though he was still fully God, he had the ability in a second to do what he wanted.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.480]   And by the way, if he'd have said, "Why don't you take that stone right there, 40-day hungry
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.360]   boy, and turn it to bread?"
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.360]   What do you think Jesus would have done?
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.360]   "You know what?
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.360]   I'm a little hungry.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.360]   You know what?
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.360]   It makes sense to me that God didn't care about you.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.360]   It hasn't been a long time since I've eaten."
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:30.440]   Well, what did Jesus do?
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.020]   What Jesus did that moment is what we've got to do.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.960]   He had to keep reminding himself of things that were true.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.760]   And so he said, "Man's not going to live by bread alone.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.960]   He's not going to live by sex alone.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.440]   He's not going to live by barbiturates alone.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.640]   He's not going to live by career alone.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.580]   He's not going to live by relationships alone."
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:47.280]   But by every word that's true of the awesome God, that's what he did.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.280]   He said, "I'm going to trust in the awesome God."
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.960]   And it says as soon as he did that, at that moment, and the reason God let him go through
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.300]   that is so that we would know in Hebrews chapter 4 that we've got a high priest who gets at
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.300]   man.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.300]   He knows how hard it is to be chaste.
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:06.880]   He knows how hard it is to be faithful, but he's showing you it's worth it.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:07.880]   It's good.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.440]   It says at that point, the spirit of God came, ministered to him.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:15.920]   The how long this was in that moment and God's sovereignty was over.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.760]   And that's why, you know, this is what it says in 2 Corinthians chapter 10.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.240]   It says, "For though we walk in the flesh, we don't war according to the flesh.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.760]   For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but they're divinely powerful for
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.720]   the destruction of fortresses.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:32.640]   We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing lifted up against the cause, the knowledge
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.400]   of God, and we're taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ."
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.920]   You want to not be despairing and anxious?
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.600]   That's what you got to do.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.400]   You got to go because look it, remember what I told you?
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   Here's Jesus over here.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.400]   Hey man, God's forgotten you.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.200]   If God loved you, he would make you not eat.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.200]   How about this?
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.600]   Hey man, I know God lets you eat anything you want, but if he really loved you, he'd
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.440]   let you eat this.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.720]   God's not good and you could eat this.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:59.440]   And by the way, God isn't good and his word's not that true.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.720]   You could eat this and you won't die and disobeying God's not that big a deal.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.320]   Those were the three lies that he gave Adam.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.840]   God isn't good, his word can't be trusted, disobeying him's not that big a deal.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.320]   You go read Matthew 4, it's exactly what Jesus has put through.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.280]   The lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the boastful pride of life, and
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.760]   he said, "God can't be true.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.760]   God's not good.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.760]   God's forgotten you.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.760]   Disobeying him won't be that big a deal.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.320]   I can give you everything he gives you."
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:30.360]   And every time you cave in, you're buying those same three lies.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.120]   And guess what happens when you buy them?
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:36.640]   You don't get the peace that sin promised you, ever.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:42.640]   Oh man, you have some moments of ecstasy, but you wake up, there you are again, naked
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.080]   and ashamed.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.360]   There's the solution.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.520]   Don't tell anybody you're pregnant.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.280]   We can take you over here and we won't call it your child.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.400]   We'll call it a mass of cells and we'll deal with it and no one ever has to know.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:00.920]   How'd that work out?
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.640]   I could go on and on.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.960]   And here's what I'm telling you as a dad, I'm not mad at you.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.520]   Your father in heaven's not mad at you, he just goes, "Oh, I know that doesn't work.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.840]   That was not the right solution."
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:17.280]   And not only are you fearful of who you are, you're fearful that someone will figure out
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.280]   what you did.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.280]   I'm not fearful.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.280]   I know what you did.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   I know what I've got for you.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.280]   Come here.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   Come here, baby.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.280]   Come here.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:32.840]   You know, let me just say this about Jesus.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:38.280]   It can be argued, gang, that the only one who really understands fully the extent of
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   what temptation is, is the one who fully resists it.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.440]   In other words, we don't even know what Jesus went through because we all at some point
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:49.560]   against that irresistible force of believing God's not good, we relented and so temptation
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.560]   stopped.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.560]   But Jesus never stopped.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.240]   And so I think he's the only one that really understands the force of temptation.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.680]   He has been tempted, not in every way as we have been without sin, he's been tempted in
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.360]   ways that none of us have even allowed ourselves to be tempted because we eventually, most
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.720]   of us, don't take the way of escape that God provided with it and we just go, and guess
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.720]   what it leads to?
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.720]   Despair and anxiety.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:14.760]   And God's there saying, "I mean, come here, I love you.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:15.760]   I'm not even mad at you.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.080]   I mean, what you're experiencing isn't my judgment.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.120]   What you're experiencing is the consequence of what I told you you would get if you did
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.120]   that."
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.360]   Do you understand that?
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:30.320]   And then I gotta let you know this.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:35.200]   Sometimes things are just happening and it has nothing to do with your sin.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.120]   You just live in a world, gang, you just need to know this.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:43.240]   The Bible says you live in a world with sin in it and so sometimes, sometimes things aren't
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.040]   gonna work the way that you want them to work.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.800]   And that shouldn't freak you out.
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   Just trust me.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.860]   And here's what I would tell you about God.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:53.860]   And I close with this.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:57.640]   What you should learn about God is that he really kind of works backwards.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:02.960]   You would think that the longer you're faithful to God, the better things would go for you
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:06.480]   but what I just need to let you know, that's almost the opposite of what happens.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:11.100]   Did you hear what I just said?
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:15.240]   The longer that you know that God is good, sometimes the more he lets you live as a testimony
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:22.400]   to others that this world is not your home and that he is awesome still.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:29.440]   I'll read you one more time from this amazing man that, ask God how long.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.680]   He said this, "God treats new Christians with a special kind of tenderness.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.360]   Much as a parent dotes on a newborn."
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:41.120]   He quotes this other guy who is a new believer, or a very experienced believer rather and
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.560]   he says, "I've seen many striking answers to prayer and more than once I've thought
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:52.040]   they were miraculous but they usually come at the beginning of or before even conversion.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.480]   As the Christian life proceeds, they tend to be rarer and rarer.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:59.880]   The refusals too are not only more frequent, they become more unmistakable, more emphatic."
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.880]   Remember Paul?
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.320]   Happened to write most of the New Testament.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.200]   Three times I asked God to remove this thorn from me.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.960]   The guy that raised people from the dead, healed people.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.880]   God, just take this thorn from me.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:12.880]   It never went away.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.880]   C.S. Lewis wrote mere Christianity.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:21.720]   God, I've waited 50 years to marry and now I'll heal my wife.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.400]   No satellite.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.440]   At first glance, such a suggestion seemed to have it all backwards.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.560]   Shouldn't faith become easier, not harder as Christians progress?
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:36.720]   But as C.S. Lewis points out, the New Testament gives two strong examples just to the opposite,
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.960]   Paul and Jesus.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.360]   Does God then forsake just those who serve him best?
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:48.200]   Well, he who served him best of all said near his tortured death, "Why hast thou forsaken
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.800]   me?"
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   When God became man, that man of all others is least comforted by God.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.880]   At his greatest need, there is a mystery here which even if I had the power, I might not
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.600]   have the courage to explore.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.480]   Meanwhile, little people like you and me, if our prayers are sometimes granted beyond
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:09.160]   all hope and probability, had better not draw hasty conclusions to our own advantage.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:12.880]   The truth is, if we were stronger, we might be less tenderly treated.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:18.080]   If we were braver, we might be sent with far less help to defend a far more desperate post
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:23.920]   in a far greater battle.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.480]   So here's where I close.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.160]   Sometimes gang, when you're waiting for God to answer, don't get anxious.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:36.760]   Just remind yourself, "Okay, this one's going to cook a long time it looks like, but I know
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   God's good."
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:42.640]   And the way you know God is good is because you can take the most awful moment in human
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.840]   history.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:51.160]   When the kindest one who ever lived, to this day, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Christians,
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.680]   even atheists go, "Yeah, Jesus, we have no problem with Jesus."
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.800]   The best man who ever lived, there was a moment when he said, "No one's going to take my life,
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   but I'm going to lay it down."
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:03.520]   In fact, the guy who just identified him as the Son of God, the Christ, when he said that,
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.520]   said, "No, you're not.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.520]   I'm going to stop that.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.400]   I know who you are, you're God in the flesh, but that's a bad plan, Jesus.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.760]   You are not going to die."
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.920]   If I had been there, if we had voted, if we took a poll, our hero Jesus that we've been
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.720]   walking with is going to go to a cross, what do you think?
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.600]   We go, "No, not him.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.800]   Give us anybody but him.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.800]   Let him live.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.120]   It's got to be good for him to live."
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.120]   Guess what?
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.480]   God said, "No, get behind me."
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.520]   That's the thinking of Satan, that it's always ease.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.120]   What God's going to do is show you love.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.120]   He's going to show you grace and he's going to show you mercy.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:36.640]   If I had been asked what to do in that moment, I would have said, "You cannot go to that
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.240]   cross."
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:41.240]   I would have stopped the very thing that led to my great salvation.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.960]   Jesus did go to a cross.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.640]   I guarantee you, on Friday night, I'd have been filled with anxiety, even though he had
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:49.120]   told me that he had this thing in control and that no one was going to take his life.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.000]   He was going to lay it down and take it back up again.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.520]   I guarantee you, Saturday morning, it'd have been tough.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:58.640]   If I had a godly friend, they would have said, "Todd, he told you three days."
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.240]   I guarantee you, Saturday afternoon, I wouldn't have eaten.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.680]   Saturday night, it'd have been really long.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.320]   Sunday morning, I wouldn't even have the courage to go see if my hopes were true.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:14.920]   I'd have sent the women.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.120]   I mean, if you can take that moment, you can just keep going back.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.400]   God, all I know is in the greatest moment of evil in the history of the world, that
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.920]   turned out to be the greatest moment of good.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:28.080]   That's all I need.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:32.160]   He tells us that our three days might be this entire life.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.440]   You might be in that wheelchair your entire life.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   It's a lie, girls.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   Let me just tell you this.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:41.640]   It's a lie if you love God and you're in a good community group and you seek after him,
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.440]   that God will eventually bring you a godly man.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.720]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:51.280]   You need to quit making that your hope.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.520]   Make your hope in God alone because here's the deal, man.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.320]   The most wonderful man in the world is going to bring you pain.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.440]   There's one promise in the Bible to marriage.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.400]   Do you know what it is?
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.760]   Such will have trouble.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.320]   Now, look, there's a lot of blessing that comes from that trouble.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:13.600]   I'm a big fan of marriage, but marriage is a lousy God.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.720]   Quit waiting for it.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.520]   You should be anxious about one thing, that you today would be indifferent in your love
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:25.240]   and pursuit of Jesus Christ.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.600]   Because in your marriage, you're eventually going to have to find your satisfaction in
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.360]   him because that person in some way is not going to be what you want them to be, but
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.640]   Jesus will be and he'll allow you out of the overflow of gratitude in your heart to love
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.640]   them.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.240]   You see, here's the thing.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.120]   What God wants you to do is to have a Christ-like faith, not just a child-like faith.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   A child-like faith is beautiful.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:43.200]   A child-like faith is the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   I shall not want.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.200]   He's a good God.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.200]   I love God.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.280]   A child-like faith is one who says, "God's always good.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.840]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:51.840]   God's always good.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:52.840]   He leads me beside quiet waters.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.840]   Oh, God's always good.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:54.840]   He restores my soul.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.840]   Oh, God's always good.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.240]   He guides me in the paths of righteousness.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.240]   I've got a good daddy.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.240]   I love my daddy."
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.240]   Right?
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:04.480]   That's a child-like faith and there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.480]   But I want to tell you something.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:08.720]   Sometimes you got to go, "It's been a long time since I've been in a green pasture.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.920]   I'm really thirsty."
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.920]   This is a Christ-like faith.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:13.920]   Are you ready?
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.920]   This is Psalm 22.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:20.600]   "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.840]   Far from deliverance are the words of my groaning.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:23.840]   Oh, my God.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:29.360]   I cry by day, but you don't answer and by night, but I have no rest.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.360]   You are holy.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.360]   I know you're holy.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.360]   I know you're good.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.360]   I know your word's true.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.280]   I know that disobeying you is a big deal, but I'm on a cross and this is hard."
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:42.960]   And if you keep reading, you find out that he keeps telling God the truth, but he waits
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:47.200]   and he doesn't use his divinity to get himself down off that cross and make it easy.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:52.120]   He waits there all the way until that last breath heeds and he says, "It is finished,"
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.680]   so that you could know that God is good.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:01.000]   See, he's not upset when you say, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.880]   But you remember, he's never forsaken you.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:08.040]   It looks like he's forsaken you, but he's never forsaken you.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:12.800]   And the more you know him, the more sometimes he lets you go through serious seasons of
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.120]   hunger and of thirst.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.480]   And you know what he says?
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.480]   "That's my boy.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   You watch him.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   That's my boy.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.480]   You know him.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.480]   He is steadfast.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.480]   He is ready.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.480]   He is righteous.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.480]   He is blameless.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.480]   He fears God.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.480]   He shuns evil.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   That's my boy.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   That's faith.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.420]   That's somebody who knows what I look like."
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.380]   He won't cave.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.360]   He's not waiting if he's not married by 30, he's going to plug this thing in.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.560]   No, that dude is with me to the end.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.560]   That's my boy.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.760]   And that's a Christlike faith.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.280]   And I'm not promising you, if you're here and you see God, it's going to get easy.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.760]   I'm promising you it might get hard for a while and he will not forsake you and you
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:54.360]   will be glad on that day and you've got no anxiety.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:58.860]   You've got nothing but a future and a hope and you will hear, "Well done."
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:02.120]   And I got the rest of eternity to convince you that you were right.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:05.200]   Father, I pray that this group would believe it.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:10.680]   I pray that this room would come to know you and that their hope and their peace would
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:16.080]   be, Father, in the CV of Jesus' life.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.680]   That they would understand that you don't forsake them.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.680]   It feels like it.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:23.000]   I thank you, Father, that we in our own and our journal and our crosses, we can yell,
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.720]   "Man, God, why does it feel so much like you've forsaken me?"
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:32.360]   But at the end, you are in heaven and we are on earth, so let our words be few and let
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:38.120]   us trust in you, the God who makes no mistakes.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.240]   You've never had to apologize.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.600]   You've never had to go, "I wish I had a do-over."
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:49.120]   And Father, we know as long as we seek first your kingdom and your righteousness, we will
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.760]   say the same thing.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:58.920]   Thank you, Lord, that you're not bothered, that sometimes temptation looks really real
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.040]   good to us.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.720]   You know exactly what that feels like.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.440]   I thank you that you haven't left us here alone.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.560]   You've given us your spirit and your word to remind us what is true, and you've even
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.680]   given us your people, other people who can run with us and keep reminding us.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.320]   I know it looks like he's forgotten you, but he hasn't.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.320]   Don't you believe it?
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:21.280]   If the cross is the curse of disease at a young age, don't you curse him.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.720]   You use every year of your dying to be faithful to him.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:31.520]   You sing his praises all the way to the end, because this life is not all there is.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.240]   And so Lord, even in the face of death, we fear not.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:41.560]   Because at the end we come back to that little childlike faith and we say, "You're my God,
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.120]   and you're a good shepherd.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.840]   I will trust in you and I will sing your praises."
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.840]   So Father, in our thirsting for quick satisfaction in the world, may we quickly turn it to your
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.680]   word which says, "Thirst for me.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.320]   Thirst for me, for you are the one that satisfies."
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320]   We are thirsty, Lord.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.960]   We pray just like you taught us to pray, that you'd come quickly.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.120]   But until you come, help us to be faithful.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.880]   Use an increasing number of godly men in this room to encourage others to wait with me.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.880]   Help me wait.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.680]   Help me remember that you are good.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.560]   For your glory, that I might be free from despair.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.560]   That the world might know that you're a God worth singing of, in Jesus' name.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:25.560]   Amen.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   [MUSIC]
