[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.820]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.720]   Welcome, friends in the room.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.980]   Welcome, friends in Fort Worth.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.660]   We're going to start in a unusual way.
[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.820]   I need everyone to stand up.
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.900]   Everyone to stand up.
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.340]   We're going to play a little game.
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.140]   We're going to play a little game.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.900]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.540]   Get excited.
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.380]   Stand it up.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.300]   Get some energy out.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.140]   Jumping jacks.
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.940]   OK.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.140]   We're going to play a game called Simon Says Fort Worth.
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.100]   I'm talking to you two.
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.180]   Everyone stands up in the room.
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.300]   I need everyone to play.
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.420]   You can't be too pretentious, speaking particularly
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.700]   to my friends in Dallas here.
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.060]   It's a struggle of ours.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.020]   Everyone's going to play.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.780]   Simon says.
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.860]   There may be a prize involved.
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.340]   We already gave away an Apple Watch.
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.500]   Who knows what else we got?
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.460]   A new car.
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.180]   So here we go.
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.740]   Everyone's involved.
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.060]   And if you see someone who doesn't follow along,
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.180]   you got to point them out.
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.780]   Citizen's arrest may get happen.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.660]   Tell them to sit down.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.220]   Here we go.
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.260]   Simon says right hand up.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.900]   Simon says left hand up.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.220]   Right hand down.
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.620]   Oh, there we go.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.500]   You're sitting down.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.300]   Sit down.
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.220]   Sit down.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.740]   Sit down.
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.460]   I think I see some people who didn't.
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.380]   All right, here we go.
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.420]   All right, here we go.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.980]   Right hand down.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.780]   Oh, man.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.780]   It's so terrible.
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.620]   All right, Simon says clap once.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.340]   Simon says clap twice.
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.140]   Clap once.
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.700]   I love it.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.460]   Man, this is really getting people going.
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.460]   Here we go.
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.580]   All right, here we go.
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.220]   Simon says both hands down.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.980]   Left hand up.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.500]   Simon says right hand up.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.860]   Simon says right hand down.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.980]   Simon says right hand up.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.620]   Clap once.
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.620]   Simon says clap once.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.500]   Simon says clap twice.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.820]   Both hands down.
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.620]   There we go.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.740]   Man, we are just steady.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.700]   Simon says both hands up.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.140]   Right hand down.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.820]   Man, it just works every time.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.780]   All right, Simon says both hands up.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.060]   Simon says both hands down.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.220]   Simon says both hands up.
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.300]   Simon says both hands down.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.420]   Simon says left hand up.
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.820]   Simon says both hands up.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.340]   Somebody needs to sit up there.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.300]   I see you in the back.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.340]   I see you in Fort Worth, too.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.780]   Yeah, uh-huh.
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.100]   Yeah, you in the back.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.860]   All right, both hands down.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.500]   No, man.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   Golly.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.940]   Simon says clap once.
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.420]   Simon says clap twice.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.180]   Clap twice.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.780]   Simon says both hands down.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.500]   Right hand up.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.260]   Simon says both hands up.
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.660]   Simon says both hands down.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.500]   Simon says sit down.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.380]   Simon says stand back up.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.780]   Sit back down.
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.140]   Simon says both hands up.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.340]   Left hand down.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.300]   All right, here we go.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.780]   Stop right there.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.500]   Y'all stay standing.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.020]   Stop right there.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.620]   Stay standing.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.900]   Stay standing.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.100]   The reason we start with that game is-- let me tell you this.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.060]   So let me ask you this.
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.260]   What would you say if I said only those people in the room
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.460]   and in Fort Worth who are right now standing get into heaven?
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.960]   Woo!
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.620]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.980]   It's not actually true.
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.260]   All right, it is true.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.940]   OK.
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.740]   All right, you guys sit back down.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.900]   Only those people who followed the rules Simon says sit down.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.620]   I love it.
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.180]   Man, we got rule followers.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.740]   I love it.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.060]   We got some firstborns in this room.
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.260]   In other words, what would you say if I said only
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.980]   the people who perfectly followed Simon's rules
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.780]   or the rules got into heaven?
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.220]   What would you say, furthermore, if Jesus said that?
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.820]   Because tonight, we're going through this series
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.580]   all summer long called Summer on the Mount,
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.300]   where we're diving into Jesus's most famous sermon of all time.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.700]   Arguably the most famous sermon of all time,
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.500]   the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.260]   And tonight, the interpretive challenge
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.500]   from the text we're going to look at in Matthew chapter 5.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.540]   If you have a Bible, you can flip there right now.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.460]   It'll be up on the screens.
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.860]   If you don't have one, no problem.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.780]   But the interpretive challenge for tonight is Jesus says that.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.580]   So what could he possibly mean?
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.780]   So tonight, we're going to really explore
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.020]   the subject of what does heaven require?
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.780]   Because he says one of the most shocking,
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.940]   if not the most shocking statements
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.980]   in his entire ministry in the verses
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.020]   that we're about to read.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.900]   We're going to pick it up in verse 17.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.700]   We're going to explore really what this relationship--
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.180]   heaven, how we can get to heaven,
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.900]   and how that relates to the law, which is
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.740]   what Jesus is about to address.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.780]   And by law, I mean the Old Testament, the Old Covenant,
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.180]   the first half of your Bible, if you have one.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.540]   We're going to explore how does Jesus fulfill the law?
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.820]   What role does the law play for us today?
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.660]   On this side of Jesus, what role does the law play for us today?
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.900]   Is it still relevant?
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.940]   And why do we abide by certain parts and not other ones?
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.460]   Why is it OK to eat shellfish, but homosexuality is not OK?
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.900]   What role does the law play for us today?
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.860]   And then really, how can we keep the law?
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.260]   So I'm just going to set the scene.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.220]   We talked about it last week.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.640]   If you weren't here, I'd encourage
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.860]   you to go to the Porch app.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.940]   And you can listen to that message.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.540]   You can be totally caught up on where we are in this series.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.660]   But here's what's going on.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.420]   So Jesus, early in his ministry, he's done some miracles.
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.620]   Things are going well.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.860]   His popularity is continuing to take off,
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.980]   because when you can do miracles, that happens.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.220]   And he goes up on this mountainside.
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.980]   And this crowd gathers around him.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.340]   And Jesus says, I'm going to take this opportunity
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.540]   to teach them.
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.220]   And he begins to lay out these radical teachings
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.500]   that those in the audience who were there that day
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.340]   would go on to change the world.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.980]   And so this summer, we're exploring
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.900]   what some of those radical teachings were.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.060]   We're going to pick up in verse 17,
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.780]   where Jesus begins the discussion around the law.
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.380]   Here's what he says.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.720]   Do not think, Jesus speaking, that I have come to abolish
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.700]   the law or the prophets.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.540]   So what is the law?
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.380]   The prophets, the prophets.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.120]   And the law is the Old Testament,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.420]   would be what his audience would have heard.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.140]   I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.900]   That Jesus says, let me get this out of the way,
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.700]   right up front, I did not come to do away with the law.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.980]   I'm not saying, hey, the law, I was just kidding.
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.580]   You know, you guys are crazy.
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.940]   We're just going to do away with that.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.280]   That's not what I'm here to do at all.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.940]   I have come to fulfill it.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.420]   Now, when you and I think law,
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.660]   we think something different than the original
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.900]   ancient Jewish audience that he's talking to.
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.060]   When you and I think law, we think taxes you need to pay
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.400]   or a speeding ticket and kind of a long arm police
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.240]   of the law.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.940]   The audience in this case, or in this context,
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.820]   heard something very different.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.640]   Law really involved every part of their life.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.420]   In other words, they didn't just hear law,
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.180]   okay, that means I can't ride my camel
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.740]   in a school zone too fast.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.840]   They heard the term that was identified
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.020]   with every aspect of their life.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.660]   The law informed everything that they could do,
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.700]   everything that they couldn't do.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.220]   The law told them what they could eat.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.600]   The law told them how to maintain,
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.460]   experience relationship with God.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.460]   It told them when they could do things,
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.020]   when they could not do certain things.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.180]   The law was huge.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.540]   It was what set the nation apart.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.580]   The law was not king, but it was close.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.260]   And so they're hearing Jesus say,
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.980]   hey, I haven't showed up on the scene
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.500]   to do away with all those Old Testament rules and laws.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.340]   I've come to fulfill them.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.900]   Now, what does he mean by fulfill?
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.180]   The word fulfill is the same word
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.140]   for to fill in what is lacking.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.020]   You can probably imagine.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.440]   What Jesus says is I didn't come to get rid of it.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.820]   I came to fill in what is lacking.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.860]   And there's three ways.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:54.820]   We're gonna move kind of quick through this.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.780]   There's three ways Jesus really fulfills
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.660]   what is lacking inside of the law.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.500]   When it comes to the Old Testament rules
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.820]   and how they were supposed to live,
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.300]   Jesus says I didn't come to do away.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.220]   I came to fulfill them.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.120]   And the first way he does that is by giving clarity
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.660]   to what they always were intended to mean.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.260]   Or raising the standard would be another way.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.740]   It seemed like he was raising the standard,
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.740]   but he just gives clarity to what the rules
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.700]   and laws he was giving.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.500]   That's the first way Jesus fulfills the law.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.100]   In other words, throughout this whole sermon
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.940]   for the rest of the summer,
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.900]   we're gonna explore how Jesus over and over says this.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.980]   You've heard it said, but I tell you.
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.620]   You've heard it said you shall not murder,
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.460]   but I tell you if you're angry,
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.380]   you've committed the same sin.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.300]   You've heard it said that you shouldn't commit adultery,
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.140]   but I tell you that if you look at someone with lust,
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.420]   you're an adulterer.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.960]   Jesus says over and over again,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.460]   you've heard it said, but I tell you.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.460]   And he brings clarity that you guys
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.580]   are all about the letter of the law.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.140]   And let me give clarity to the spirit of the law,
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.380]   what it was always intended to mean.
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.860]   It's as though he was saying to us,
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.860]   you've heard it said you shouldn't drive 70.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.140]   I say you should only drive 30,
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.220]   or you shouldn't drive a car, you should take a bike.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.140]   Jesus says, I've come to explain the intended meaning
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.460]   or to raise the standard
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.460]   to where it was always intended to be.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.460]   And the second way Jesus really fulfills the law,
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.960]   so that he brings clarity to, oh man,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.460]   anger and murder, they're not far apart.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.300]   In fact, according to Jesus, they're the same thing.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.540]   The second way that he does is that he lives,
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.020]   he fulfills the law by living the perfect life.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.740]   The only person for thousands of years,
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.460]   Jews would have these 613 different commands
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.940]   and there were 10 big ones,
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.100]   you've heard probably called the 10 commandments
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.500]   that Charles and Heston came down with the mountain from.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.380]   And he, Jesus, was the only person
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.220]   who perfectly could live the mountain.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.540]   He's the only person standing at the end of Simon says.
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.140]   He's the only person who is able
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.980]   to fully fulfill what the law required to do what it says.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.220]   In fact, even in one scene, Jesus,
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.900]   his crowd continues to grow
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.700]   and there's this group called the Pharisees
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.900]   who doesn't like Jesus stepping on their turf.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.180]   And so like, hey buddy, get your own city,
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.060]   Jerusalem's ours.
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.580]   And the crowd is gathering around him
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.060]   and they say, we're gonna kill this man.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:14.060]   And Jesus responds, what sin would you convict me of?
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.500]   What sin have I committed?
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.460]   And it's literally this like awkward silence
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.140]   and Jesus just walks off.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.860]   That there was never a time where he broke the law.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.060]   Second way he fulfilled it was by his life.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.860]   And then the third and really most important
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.180]   and most emphasized in the Bible
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.420]   way that Jesus fulfilled the law
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.420]   was that he fulfilled its demands for you and for me.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.860]   And a lot of you guys know this,
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.500]   but this may be a review,
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.880]   maybe you haven't heard this before.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.200]   Jesus steps in and he fulfills what you and I,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.660]   when we broke the law or did not live up to God's standard,
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.060]   when we were angry, when we were lustful or adulterers,
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.100]   Jesus would say.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.500]   Anytime those sins were done, there's a debt created.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.040]   There's a penalty that must be paid
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.900]   and Jesus fulfills the law by saying,
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.340]   I will pay fully for everything that you have ever done.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.640]   For anyone who will trust in me,
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   I will totally satisfy the righteous requirement
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.720]   or the requirement and the debt that you've created.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.840]   It's like you got a speeding ticket in that scenario
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.640]   and Jesus says, I'll pay for it.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.160]   I'll cover the gap that you created by your decisions.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.880]   Jesus is the fulfiller of the law
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.920]   and we're gonna really come back to that.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.080]   But it's not dissimilar from Jesus stepping in
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.520]   and filling what is lacking from when you,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.160]   this is the best way I can say it.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.200]   I don't know if you're like me,
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.760]   but the dentist, I like avoid the dentist like the plague.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.480]   And it is probably not good for my teeth.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.580]   In fact, I know it's not.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.040]   But I think it's because my first experience
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.200]   at the dentist was when I was 22.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   So, ouch, okay.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.040]   So, everyone's laughing.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.480]   I don't know, that's hurtful.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.320]   So when I was growing up, I was raised by a single mom
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.080]   and we didn't have dental insurance.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.040]   She was like, your teeth are straight, get back in the game.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.180]   And so she would, we never went to the dentist.
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.800]   And so my first time to the dentist, I was 22
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.440]   and I was like, I feel like I should just go.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.280]   I'm out on my own.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.680]   This probably seems right.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.620]   So I go to the dentist and I sit down,
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.920]   explain the scenario to the dentist.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.040]   And he takes the x-rays and I'm like,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.280]   everything's exciting for me 'cause I've never been.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.240]   I'm like, this chair, it leans back.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.520]   This is awesome.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.800]   And he comes in and he's like, hey, this is great.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.060]   Well, I've got some bad news
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.900]   and I need to ask you some questions
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.240]   in light of that bad news.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.680]   And I said, okay, great, what's the bad news?
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.600]   And he said, well, you have 14 cavities.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.340]   I'm like, did you double check?
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.180]   Did you count that?
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.020]   Are you sure?
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:40.860]   You have 14?
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.560]   And he goes, yes, pulls him up, shows me.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.240]   And I'm like, how can that be?
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.560]   He begins to say, tell me about how much soda
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.960]   you're drinking.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.360]   Do you put sugar in your coffee?
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.760]   Are you sleeping with candy in your mouth?
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.400]   What are you doing that is causing all of these cavities?
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.800]   And I'm like, what?
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.620]   Is that wrong?
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.620]   And of course, what he does is he goes in
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.240]   and he begins to fill all of the cavities.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.380]   All of the holes or all of the decay
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.860]   that through my decisions had been brought into my life.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.560]   Jesus comes, or the dentist comes.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.200]   Jesus came in that day.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.780]   And, oh man, gotta get more sleep.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.940]   And the dentist fills in what's lacking.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.460]   In the same way,
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:36.660]   Jesus says, I'm going to come and fill in
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.460]   what is lacking or what decay, destruction,
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.240]   you have brought into your life through poor decisions.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.820]   Whatever holes, cavities, things you've created
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.420]   by your decisions, by your mistakes,
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.860]   by past relationships, by past addiction,
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.060]   by a current addiction, by poor decisions, sin.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.620]   Jesus said, I will fill what is lacking.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.660]   He's the fulfiller of those things.
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.120]   And really, that's not only what he says,
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.340]   but he tells us about how our relationship
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.540]   to the law exists today.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.860]   Here's what he says, verse 18.
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.220]   For truly, I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear,
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.140]   not the smallest letter nor the least stroke of the pen
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.100]   will by any means disappear from the law
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.540]   until everything is accomplished.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.860]   Therefore, anyone who sets aside
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.140]   one of the least of these commands
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.260]   and teaches others to do accordingly
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.860]   will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.060]   But whoever practices and teaches these commands
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.340]   will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.380]   This brings us to our second point
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.620]   of what role does the law play for us today?
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.560]   Because Jesus just said, the Old Testament,
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.980]   all the laws are still in play
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.140]   until their intended purpose has been accomplished.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.720]   Until it's been totally achieved,
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.860]   until their purpose has been accomplished.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.220]   In other words, all the laws that make up the 613 laws
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.420]   in the first half of your Bible,
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.380]   if you ever wonder why, if we're set free in Christ from law
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.220]   why do we have these?
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.060]   Jesus just said, until each one of those laws
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.380]   reaches their intended purpose
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.460]   or accomplishes the fullness for which they were given,
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.860]   they will not be done away with.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.700]   Now here's why that's significant
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.060]   and here's how that relates to us.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.940]   So when we look at the Old Testament,
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.520]   we really, we see 613 laws that are broken up
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.900]   into three different categories.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.300]   And the first two are kind of similar
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.100]   in that they deal with specific instructions
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:28.940]   to the nation of Israel.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.860]   So God sets up the nation of Israel,
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.140]   says hey, this is what you're gonna do,
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.420]   this is what you're gonna do.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.380]   Not because I'm trying to rip you off,
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.940]   I'm trying to give you life.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.620]   I'm trying to set you free.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.220]   I'm trying to lead you towards life.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.500]   So he gives them all these rules
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.980]   and inside of the laws that we see there,
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.180]   the first two of those three categories
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.440]   are the ceremonial and the civil.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.260]   They're like specific to the nation of Israel.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.180]   This is how you're gonna govern yourself.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.780]   This is how your kings should act.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.460]   This is how you should do these things.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.180]   This is the kind of food you should eat.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.940]   You shouldn't eat shellfish.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.780]   That was included in there,
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.940]   we're gonna come back to that.
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.820]   And the ceremonial, whenever you sin,
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.860]   or when you do this sin, something has to die
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.840]   or there has to be shedding of blood.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.980]   I want you to associate that with the payment.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.700]   So God says nation of Israel,
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.080]   these are specific in how you're to act within society.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.380]   So those are that set of laws.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.520]   Those two out of the three groups.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.060]   The third group, and those both of the other two
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.520]   have been, and Christ would go on to teach,
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:32.340]   and really his disciples, fulfilled by Jesus on the cross.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.100]   You don't have to sacrifice goats anymore
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.220]   because Jesus was the perfect sacrifice.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.540]   All of those things reached
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.700]   and achieved their intended purpose, Jesus would say.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.820]   But the third group of laws that we see
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.740]   is what's called the moral laws.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.660]   These are the moral laws.
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.960]   These are what the 10 commandments really would fall into.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.940]   These are the laws you shouldn't steal,
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.220]   you shouldn't commit adultery, you shouldn't lie,
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.560]   you shouldn't commit murder.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.920]   All these different moral laws
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.220]   that really indicate timeless things
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.900]   that their fullness has not been accomplished yet.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.340]   In other words, the laws,
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.500]   when it comes to the Old Testament that we keep
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.420]   are the ones that are the moral instructions.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.540]   They provide for us what our relationship
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.160]   or what laws we're supposed to keep
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.940]   inside of the Old Testament.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.080]   And really, it's not that we're to keep those
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.440]   because they make us have right standing with God.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.620]   In other words, a Christian is made a Christian
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.740]   by Jesus on the cross.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.620]   You guys following me on this?
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.940]   It's really heady stuff, we're going ancient Judaism.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.300]   The Christian is made a Christian by Jesus dying.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.180]   And so why would I have to keep any laws?
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.620]   If I trust in Christ alone, I get to have eternal life.
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.540]   The reason we keep moral laws
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.940]   is not to have a relationship with God,
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.820]   but because we have a relationship with God.
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.980]   God didn't give the nation of Israel
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.660]   a bunch of moral laws because he wanted to rip them off.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.700]   He wanted to protect them.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.920]   I love you.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.380]   We don't do it to, we don't keep the moral laws
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:07.460]   to earn God's love, but to experience his love.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.300]   Does that make sense?
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.260]   There's a huge difference.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.140]   And so when it relates to the Old Testament,
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.520]   which one should we follow, which one should we not?
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.820]   We know that the moral laws are the ones
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.340]   that have not been fully accomplished according to Jesus.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.900]   And those are given to us not to bind us up,
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.700]   but to set us free or to give us life in following them.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.440]   It's really not dissimilar from when I was in high school,
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.260]   there were certain laws that I had to abide by
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.140]   because I was underneath the authority of the high school.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.100]   And while I was there, even though,
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.860]   or while I was there, I would get,
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.140]   if I didn't show up to first period class,
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.100]   we would get demerits.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.540]   My team made fun of me today 'cause they were like,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.360]   who got demerits?
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.200]   We got demerits.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.380]   And I would show up, and if I didn't show up on time,
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.380]   I would get demerits.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.860]   And if I got three demerits, you had to go to detention.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.060]   So if I didn't abide by that rule, I got in trouble.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.780]   Now, there were other laws
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.700]   that I would also get a demerit for,
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.500]   such as running in the hallway with scissors.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.540]   And I don't know why that would be appealing to anyone,
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.780]   but especially in high school.
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.020]   But if you did that, you would get in trouble.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.460]   Now, both of those were laws.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.100]   And although I've graduated from high school
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.640]   and am no longer under the tyranny of high school,
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.480]   and can do, I can run all I want with scissors,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.920]   I don't have to be at class on time,
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.200]   and I can run with scissors,
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.440]   but the principle behind running with scissors still exists.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.680]   It's still not a good idea.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.400]   Poke your eye out, die.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.200]   And that's what God has, that's what God,
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.440]   even though we've graduated from the Old Testament law
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.160]   of relating to God,
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.360]   there are still laws and still moral revelations
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.020]   or still moral will, God's moral will that's revealed
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.020]   that it's still not a good idea to murder,
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.620]   even though that's not gonna affect
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.880]   my relationship with Christ,
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.900]   even though we've graduated from the system of the law.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.780]   Does that make sense?
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.980]   So those are the laws as it relates to the Old Testament
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.060]   that haven't been accomplished,
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.740]   and those are the ones that still apply to us today.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.860]   Because God is a God who loves you and loves me.
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.820]   And he gives us not just the letter of the law,
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.220]   but the spirit, I have an intention behind it
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.240]   to protect you.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.560]   Why could you not eat shellfish,
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.940]   and why would homosexuality be wrong?
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.740]   The nation of Israel didn't eat shellfish,
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.860]   and you're gonna hear this if you haven't heard it yet,
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.820]   especially with as much of a issue
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.220]   as just sexuality in general is in our culture,
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.860]   but homosexuality right now, this is a common argument.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.540]   How come you can eat shrimp, but you can't be homosexual?
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.380]   Or we would say that would not be something to do.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.300]   And the reason is, the reason God outlawed shrimp
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.100]   at this time, to the best of our understanding,
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.820]   is because in ancient, you can still research this today,
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.220]   in ancient cultures, the shrimp were bottom dwellers,
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.580]   and they were, because of the nature of that
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.200]   and the cleansing abilities at that time,
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.380]   they were unable to clean them.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.540]   God basically says, I wanna protect you.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.980]   The reason I don't wanna eat pig,
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.740]   pig has this worm that is unique to pig inside of it,
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:16.100]   if it's not cooked, or if it's in a pig herd,
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.460]   where they're infested with that,
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.540]   and God says, I want to protect you.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:25.020]   I was gonna say, you guys know pigs don't sweat?
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.700]   That's another thing that kinda messes me.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.300]   We're just gonna keep moving on.
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.500]   Maybe that, I wouldn't be surprised if we get up there
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.920]   and God's like, you ate the pig?
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.700]   Really, I told you not to eat the pig.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.020]   Anyways, so the reason why we would say those things,
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.980]   because now we're able to, to the best of our ability,
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.500]   the intent behind the law was protection.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.700]   Now, based on how we can clean things,
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.380]   we're no longer in danger of those certain things.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.160]   Things like marriage, divorce, stealing,
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.860]   these things haven't changed.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.180]   Homosexuality has not changed.
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.260]   And if that wasn't enough,
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.860]   the New Testament also addresses that issue.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.700]   And if that's something you would love to hear more about,
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.860]   we'd love to talk to you.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.020]   And there's resources on the Porch app
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.140]   we'd love to point you to, Same Love.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.860]   There's a message JP did during Lyrics and Lies,
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.860]   it's one of the best messages I've ever heard on the topic.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.380]   Please go listen to it.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.660]   Okay, so moving on.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.380]   And what does it relate to our ability to experience
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.740]   what the law was meant to point us to?
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.220]   Or what does Jesus have to say
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:27.660]   with our righteousness that heaven requires?
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.740]   What does Jesus have to say,
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.980]   which is what he's about to tell us?
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.900]   And he finishes and gives maybe the most radical statement
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.500]   Jesus ever gave, and he gave a lot of them.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.220]   For I tell you that unless your righteousness
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.560]   surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.260]   you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.580]   I'm gonna read it again.
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.380]   For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.940]   that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.140]   you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.980]   At this point, his audience is sucking air going,
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.020]   "What, what did he just say?"
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.860]   Okay, this guy needs to go back to carpentry
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.740]   'cause preaching is not his thing.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.220]   They're all going, "How can that even be possible?"
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.660]   He uses the word, unless your righteousness surpasses,
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.660]   it's really the word excels abundantly.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.500]   Unless your righteousness excels abundantly
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.300]   beyond the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.140]   you won't enter.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.460]   Who were the Pharisees and teachers of the law?
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.780]   They were the most religious men, disciplined men
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.140]   that the world had seen.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.860]   Today, even the Hasidic Jews that we know of,
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.140]   pale in comparison to the laws
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.660]   that these men would have followed.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.740]   They were men and women who kept not only all 613 rules
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.660]   in the Old Testament and memorized them,
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.980]   most of you haven't even read most of the Old Testament,
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.860]   they memorized it.
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.340]   And not only that, they added 1,500 different rules to it.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.260]   They added a bunch of other rules
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.940]   to make sure they wouldn't get close to breaking the 613.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.740]   And in order to not break the third commandment,
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.200]   you shall not take God's name in vain,
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.220]   they said, we're not even gonna say God's name.
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.260]   We're not even gonna mention it.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.460]   So anytime we're gonna pray, we're just gonna go,
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.700]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.540]   That would be what they do.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.380]   They wouldn't mention it today.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.780]   I mean, you've probably seen this.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:14.940]   They would not mention the law.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.340]   They had this group of Pharisees
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.820]   that were like the super religious Pharisees,
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.900]   and they were the ones called the bleeding Pharisees.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.900]   Here's why.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.500]   Pharisees would walk around with their head bowed
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.260]   in order to not be tempted to look at a woman
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.100]   and have sexual temptation.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.560]   And the bleeding Pharisees were the ones
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.300]   who were so committed that they kept on bumping into walls,
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.980]   and it was a badge of honor to be covered in blood
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.060]   because they were so committed to not breaking the law.
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.460]   They had laws around the amount of work.
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.980]   You could only carry a fig.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.540]   Anything that weighed more than a fig on the Sabbath,
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.040]   you could not carry.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.580]   These were the elite of elite.
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.620]   If anyone was good at being religious,
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.420]   at keeping the rules, it was them.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.380]   And Jesus just said, not even they are even close.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.100]   You need to excel abundantly beyond where they are.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.700]   This is like me saying, look,
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.020]   this is how his audience would have heard it.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.220]   Unless you're better at basketball than LeBron James,
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.260]   you will not enter the kingdom,
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.780]   or Steph Curry, based on his track record.
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.820]   Unless you're better than he at basketball,
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:13.940]   you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.440]   Or unless you're more generous than Bill Gates,
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.020]   who was named last week the most generous human
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.020]   that's ever lived.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.220]   Unless you're more generous, you're going,
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.840]   what, that's impossible.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.620]   Or unless you're more pure than Mother Teresa,
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.460]   you're going, what?
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.860]   Wait, David, she was a nun.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.360]   She wasn't married.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.740]   Yeah, unless you're more pure.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.180]   Wait, but she never had sex.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.380]   She never kissed a guy.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.600]   Unless you're more pure.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.900]   And his audience is going, what?
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.740]   How can this be?
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.920]   If that's the case, no one's good enough.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.020]   How can that be possible?
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.340]   And if it wasn't bad enough already,
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.020]   Jesus, a few verses later, would say this.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:56.700]   You, therefore, this is verse 48 of chapter five,
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.200]   must be perfect, as your heavenly Father
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.180]   is perfect.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.740]   And they're going, Jesus, it was already hard enough.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.000]   I mean, you're coming and making it even harder on us.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.280]   How, no one can be good enough.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.060]   And Jesus would say, that's the point.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.580]   That's why he would start the message
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.820]   with his thesis statement we talked about last week.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.520]   Blessed are the poor in spirit,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.500]   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.140]   In other words, what does God require
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.580]   in order to get into heaven?
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.020]   You gotta be perfect.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.220]   What, Jesus, perfect?
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.480]   No one can be perfect.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.280]   You gotta be perfect if you wanna experience heaven.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   Well, how does that connect to blessed are the poor
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.360]   in spirit, because Jesus taught in what
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.580]   the New Testament teaches is that there is
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.800]   a perfect righteousness that is only found in Jesus
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.000]   and that he offers freely to anyone who will take it.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.340]   In other words, poor in spirit is someone
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.000]   who's spiritually bankrupt, who says,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.860]   I know on my own, I can't get in.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.560]   I do not deserve God's love.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.380]   I do not deserve to experience eternity with him.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.300]   I am spiritually bankrupt.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.700]   And Jesus says, that's the person who's a perfect candidate
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.180]   to have a relationship with me, to have eternal life.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.820]   But the person who says, no, no, no,
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.980]   I'm a pretty good person.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.940]   I think I can do it.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.860]   I'm gonna follow these rules.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.260]   I'm gonna make sure I only carry a fig.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.820]   That person, they'll never make it
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.400]   because you gotta be perfect.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.220]   But the person who says, I know I'll never get there,
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.600]   Jesus says, yours is the kingdom of heaven
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.960]   because I've offered a free gift.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.560]   If you'll just accept it, you can earn it.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.240]   This is why Jesus would say later to the Pharisees,
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.420]   this religious, they always went to church.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.840]   They were the seminary grads.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.940]   The prostitutes go in before you do to the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.320]   You guys who have totally oriented your life
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.440]   around keeping God's law, the prostitutes,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.200]   the thieves, sinners will enter the kingdom before you will
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.080]   because you're self-righteous.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.900]   Here's the hard thing about self-righteousness.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.960]   It's hard to see in the mirror.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.800]   Like most of us in the room, we go,
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.960]   no, I'm not self-righteous.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.080]   I mean, I'm great with carrying way more than figs on Sunday.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.720]   I'm not self-righteous at all.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.040]   The most common example of self-righteousness
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.100]   is really what I think is probably the most common belief
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.720]   in our country.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.240]   It's the belief that I'm a pretty good person.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.400]   Like if someone was to come up to you and ask,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.880]   hey, if you were to die today,
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.920]   do you think you'd go to heaven?
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.080]   And your answer would be, yeah, yeah, I think so.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.920]   And they said, well, why?
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.960]   And you said, well, I'm a pretty good person.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.760]   I mean, I'm not the best, I'm not perfect,
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.040]   but I'm better than most people.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.720]   I'm not Hitler and I pay my taxes
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.220]   and I try to be a nice person.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.600]   Self-righteous, depending on yourself
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.700]   for your righteousness.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.580]   All those things are connected to self.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.820]   And Jesus says, if you are self-righteous,
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.140]   if you depend on yourself for righteousness,
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.200]   you will not be righteous enough
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.820]   because the standard is perfection.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.580]   And I think the scariest thing
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.340]   is that so many of us in the room
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.020]   have bought into that lie,
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.980]   that I'm a pretty good person.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.220]   I mean, I may have done some mistakes,
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.540]   but I try to be nice and I try to be kind.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.140]   And really what we buy into is this idea
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.100]   that somehow our deeds,
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.060]   and this is every major world religion.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.380]   So Jesus would say, all of them,
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.580]   if they wanna get in, they have to be perfect,
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.180]   unless they wanna accept me and my perfect righteousness
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.740]   that I'll give them freely.
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.540]   But he says, look, if you wanna depend on yourself,
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.340]   you've gotta be perfect.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.500]   And all of us would say, look,
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.940]   I think God will probably,
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.780]   or a lot of us would say,
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.220]   God would probably accept me 'cause I'm a good person.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.220]   I've done some bad things,
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.780]   but I try to outweigh them by some good things.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.500]   And Jesus would say, that doesn't work.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.540]   I mean, we know this doesn't work.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:11.500]   If I was to hit your car or cause damage,
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.020]   burn down your house, and I won't.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.360]   But if I was to do something to you,
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.020]   and then I was like, look, all right,
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.220]   so that's behind us.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.380]   But how about I bring you Starbucks every Friday
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.220]   for the next six months?
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.060]   That would be nice, right?
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.340]   It wouldn't make up for it.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.700]   We know that, and even if you're going,
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.620]   that's too extreme.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.940]   Those are way on the opposite ends of the spectrum.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.100]   If someone was to hurt your child,
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.740]   or hurt your parents, or kill your close friend,
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.200]   you wouldn't be like, yeah, that's fine.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.140]   Just try to be nice to me.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.540]   We know that it doesn't make up for it.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.980]   And yet this is such a common belief
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.580]   that if we just are good,
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:52.760]   and Jesus says that's self-righteousness,
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.520]   and as long as you trust in self,
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.620]   you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.220]   You will go to hell.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:08.620]   Jesus alone fulfills the law,
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.700]   and he alone offers the payment
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.340]   for the debt that our sin has created.
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.340]   What Jesus is showing in this verse
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:24.340]   is that you and I have an inability to keep the law.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:30.740]   And not only that, we have an inability to pay for our sins.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.060]   We can't afford it.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.100]   It's too high.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.420]   And even if we could, the sins keep piling up
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.460]   and piling up.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.340]   But Jesus says, if you'll trust in me,
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.540]   if you'll trust in me,
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.260]   if you'll trust in my perfect righteousness,
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.180]   you can have eternal life
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.220]   based on whatever you've done,
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.860]   no matter what you've done.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.040]   If you'll accept that free gift, it's yours.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.800]   When I was, my first year on staff at Watermark,
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.060]   it was six years ago, and I was in grad school.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.580]   And I was part-time here and full-time in school,
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.100]   and I was making 700 bucks a month.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.540]   So I was rolling in it,
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.620]   and I was trying to make ends meet,
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.860]   and I'm trying to pay tuition bills.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.420]   And I was literally homeless.
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.480]   I didn't have a home.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.040]   I was living with this family in their spare bedroom,
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.260]   and doing odd jobs on the side,
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.980]   power washing and giving plasma,
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.340]   and trying to pay bills.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.180]   And during that time,
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.260]   I was able to kind of make ends meet
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.260]   for one of the semesters,
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.100]   and then I was looking towards the next semester,
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.340]   and I still had debt behind me
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.820]   from already one semester of school,
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.180]   and I was looking towards the next one,
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.940]   and I got my bill for the second semester,
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.320]   and I was going, oh my gosh,
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.380]   I feel like I'm never gonna be able to pay this off.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.540]   I'm never gonna get out of this.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.600]   Because the minute that I can pay a little bit
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.580]   from this $700 a month,
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:59.340]   the higher and higher the debt continues to get.
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.300]   You have a debt, and I have a debt
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.340]   that we'll never be able to pay off.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.620]   No matter how good you think you are,
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.820]   how good you could live for the rest of your life,
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:12.660]   the debt will only continue to grow,
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.860]   and get higher and bigger,
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.860]   and you'll never be able to pay it off.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.740]   I went into the family's home
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.620]   to really kind of say goodbye.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:24.460]   It was Christmas break,
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.600]   and I was gonna go home to Houston,
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.460]   which is where I was from, or am from.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.500]   And I went in, and basically it was Christmas break,
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.340]   and so, hey, goodbye, Merry Christmas.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.300]   And they handed me this letter,
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.460]   and they said, hey, we wanna give you something.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.520]   And I opened it up, and it said, it's been paid for.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.780]   We paid for the debt that you owed.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.620]   We covered it.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.780]   And immediately, I'm going,
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.780]   this mixture of like gratitude, and like what, how,
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.220]   and humbling, and I'm going, how's that even,
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.940]   how did you even know who to call to pay that off?
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.260]   How were you able to do that?
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.220]   I thought, no, no, no, this is too much.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.060]   It's too much.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.060]   I need to pay you back.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:08.900]   I need to do something.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.260]   I need to go, I'll mow the lawn for a while.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.660]   And they're like, we have a lawn boy.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.960]   We have several, actually, so you're not gonna make a debt.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.240]   And it was in that moment, really,
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:24.240]   that I was reminded, that's what Christ has done for you,
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.740]   and for me.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.740]   There's a debt that you couldn't pay
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:28.740]   that kept getting bigger and bigger,
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.060]   and he said, I'll pay it.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.100]   I'll pay for it, and whoever will put their trust in me,
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.740]   I'll pay for it.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.500]   Whoever will say, Jesus, on the cross,
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.060]   I believe that you died for me,
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.820]   for everything that I've ever done,
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.140]   and you paid for it on the cross.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.660]   You paid for my abortion.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.520]   You paid for my pornography.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.660]   You paid for my materialism.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:55.180]   You paid for my anxiety.
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.740]   You paid for it, and I don't deserve it,
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.340]   but I'm trusting in that.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.060]   Jesus to that person says,
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.000]   you have perfect righteousness, now and forever.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.940]   The sins you haven't committed, think about that.
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.540]   You haven't even committed yet,
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:19.120]   the sins in your future, paid for, totally paid for.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.240]   And that's the message that Jesus offers,
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.300]   and standing on that hillside,
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.820]   he would go on to tell them,
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.200]   unless you have perfect righteousness,
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.640]   we can't be perfect, that's the point.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.540]   But I am, and I've paid for it.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.740]   Will you just accept it?
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.300]   But God, you don't know what I've done,
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.260]   or when I look behind me, I've stolen, I've cheated,
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.420]   I've committed adultery, I paid for it.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.100]   I paid for it.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.260]   Will you trust in me?
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.940]   All of the Bible can be summarized down to two words.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.040]   Trust me, that God speaks to humanity.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.400]   I love you, and I paid for it.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.880]   Jesus is the fulfiller of the law.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.580]   He's the only one who can keep it.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:12.280]   And he's paid for all the lawbreakers like me,
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.640]   and like you, and anyone who would trust in him.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.200]   I'm gonna pray that we do that.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.540]   Father, we love you, some of us do.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.780]   Regardless, we all need you.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:33.780]   We all have sins in our past, actions,
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.740]   mistakes, things that we've done.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:40.340]   Some that we regret, some that we don't even remember,
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.940]   and you speak over all of us.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.300]   I've paid for them.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.900]   Will you trust me?
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.220]   Father, I pray for my friends in the room
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.260]   who have a past of sin and pain,
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:00.440]   and poor decisions that mark all of us.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.580]   But they don't know you.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.660]   They're self-righteous, even though they don't know
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.820]   or believe that, they're trusting in themselves.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.960]   Would you, by your Spirit, be heavy on their hearts now,
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.100]   reminding them and reminding us all that we need you,
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.700]   and you alone offer the payment
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:22.900]   for all that we've ever done?
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.380]   We love you, amen.
