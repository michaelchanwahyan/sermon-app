 Psalm 16.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,040
 Keep me, save my God, for in you I take refuge.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,040
 I say to the Lord, you are my Lord.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,600
 Apart from you, I have no good thing.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,720
 I say to the holy people who are in the land,

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,040
 they are the noble ones in whom is my delight.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,680
 Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more.

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,720
 I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,440
 or take their names upon my lip.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,520
 Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,880
 You make my lot secure.

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,120
 The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,720
 Surely I have a delightful inheritance.

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
 I will praise you, the Lord, who counsels me.

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,440
 Even at night, my heart instructs me.

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,640
 I keep my eyes always on the Lord.

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,240
 With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,040
 Therefore, my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices.

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,000
 My body also will rest secure, because you will not

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,720
 abandon me to the realm of the dead,

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,840
 nor will you let your faithful one see decay.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,720
 You make known to me the path of life.

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,440
 You will fill me with joy in your presence,

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,800
 with eternal pleasures at your right hand.

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
 The word of the Lord, let me pray.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,400
 Father, this is your kingdom.

37
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,640
 May your kingdom come.

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,800
 May you reign on earth as you do in heaven.

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,500
 May you fill our hearts.

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,120
 Would you capture every person in the room,

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,880
 our hearts and minds, and help us to be better lovers

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,440
 of you, better, have greater knowledge of you.

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,520
 Would you increase our affections for you

44
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,760
 as we leave this place, Lord?

45
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,880
 Will we leave here more in love with you,

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,720
 more faithful people, ready to do your will?

47
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,000
 Would you just set our hearts on fire tonight, God,

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
 as we teach from this ancient writing

49
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,340
 that you scribe through a great king,

50
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,760
 a king who is a man after your heart.

51
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,720
 Father, would you teach us more about your character,

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,440
 who you are, and what you've done for us?

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,000
 Would you show us Jesus tonight, Lord?

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,120
 Help us to see Jesus tonight and worship him, Lord,

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,400
 for your glory and your fame and your honor.

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,120
 In Christ's name, amen, amen.

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,720
 Porch, it's great to be with you guys.

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,880
 Really fun worshiping with you.

59
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,540
 Thank you so much for filling out that survey.

60
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,440
 We do that not to sell your information,

61
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,820
 but honestly, just to be better ministers to you,

62
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,000
 to know who you are and where you're at

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,880
 so we can serve you better.

64
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,400
 So that's why it's important.

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
 Did you guys have a good Thanksgiving?

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,280
 (congregation cheering)

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,920
 Awesome, man, awesome.

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,880
 Did y'all do the Black Friday deal afterwards?

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,120
 - Yes. - No.

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,920
 Some say yes, some say no.

71
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,760
 We weren't going to this year.

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,600
 We've done it before.

73
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,960
 I've done the whole 4 a.m. thing,

74
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,800
 tried to get a TV $200 cheaper or something.

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,760
 But this year, we weren't going to.

76
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
 But my mom was in town, and so we were there.

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,600
 So she was watching the kids.

78
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,400
 And she was like, "You and Monica should go shopping."

79
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
 It was Friday, Friday after Thanksgiving.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,920
 I had on my fat pants, my elastic band, joggers.

81
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,800
 You have to, right?

82
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
 And so anyways, we're like,

83
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,480
 I don't know why I told you guys that,

84
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,320
 but just living authentically.

85
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,480
 And so then we were like,

86
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,600
 "Okay, well, let's go check it out."

87
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,400
 And so she and I go to Toys R Us,

88
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,040
 and we're there, and a park and everything.

89
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,880
 And there's a part of me that's like,

90
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,560
 "Oh, there's nothing we need.

91
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,240
 "We don't need to do Christmas shopping right now.

92
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
 "Like, really, what's going on?"

93
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,800
 And we get out of the car,

94
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,320
 and there's this lady coming out of Toys R Us,

95
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,200
 and she has this shopping cart just overflowing with gifts.

96
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,520
 And there's the gifts on the bottom shelf

97
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,480
 or that little area underneath the cart,

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
 and then the cart is just falling out.

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,240
 I mean, boxes are falling out.

100
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,080
 And so she pushes it, and a box falls off the bottom,

101
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,160
 and she doesn't even realize it,

102
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,680
 and she just looks frazzled.

103
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,480
 Like, she just looks like she fought somebody

104
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,320
 over a Tickle Me Elmo or something.

105
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,240
 And I'm like, I'm seeing her,

106
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,400
 and I'm a little bit away from her,

107
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,600
 and the box is on the ground.

108
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,320
 I'm like, "Ma'am, ma'am, you forgot your box."

109
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,000
 And so then she kind of is like, "What?"

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,680
 You know, and looks, and she goes to pick it up.

111
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,760
 She lets go of her cart.

112
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,040
 Her cart begins to stroll into oncoming traffic.

113
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,480
 And so then I run after her cart, and I grab it,

114
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,440
 and I bring it back and help her get her box in.

115
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,560
 And she's just like, "Thank you," and then leaving.

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
 And honestly, what I thought, I was just like,

117
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,640
 "How pathetic," you know?

118
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,560
 Just full transparent.

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,160
 I'm just like, "Ah, this lady's just going store to store,

120
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,320
 "stacking up stuff, you know, and she goes in here

121
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,160
 "trying to get a deal, and she gets all this stuff."

122
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,380
 And so, anyway, so we part ways.

123
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,640
 Monica and I go inside, and about an hour and a half later,

124
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
 there I am checking out.

125
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,960
 I've got two carts that look just like hers.

126
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,600
 I'm all frazzled, you know, I'm like, "What is going on?"

127
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,160
 You like kind of go down an aisle,

128
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,800
 and then somebody else is coming at you,

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,100
 so you come pull out, and you're just fighting traffic

130
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,940
 everywhere you go.

131
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,560
 We got toys for everyone in our lives that need toys,

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,600
 you know, at the Christmas shopping, done,

133
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
 and I'm sitting there, and as I'm in the checkout,

134
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,760
 all I could think about was that lady when I came in.

135
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,040
 I'm like, "I am that lady.

136
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,060
 "She and I are one.

137
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,360
 "Like, what's wrong with me right now?"

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,200
 And as I think about that, like, why do we do that?

139
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,280
 We do that because we think we have a certain amount of time

140
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,440
 and we can get a deal, and we can get ahead,

141
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,520
 and it just kind of becomes this tradition,

142
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,440
 and before you know it, like, right after

143
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,920
 our entire country stops to give thanks for all we have,

144
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,960
 like, you know, then we just turn around,

145
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,120
 and we go and get as much as we can,

146
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,040
 and we fight people for it.

147
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,000
 It's crazy, it's the craziest dichotomy

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,040
 I can think of right now.

149
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,080
 That we go from one moment,

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,760
 "Lord, thank you so much for everything.

151
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,600
 "Okay, give me, give me, give me, give me."

152
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,700
 And as I think about that, it's really just a microcosm

153
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,080
 or a micro example of what we do in life.

154
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,960
 The problem with me and the problem with that woman,

155
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,840
 we were driven by our desires.

156
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,440
 Our desires to please people in our lives,

157
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,600
 our desires to find things on sale,

158
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,760
 our desires to get stuff,

159
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,360
 and when you go through this life

160
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,960
 and you're driven by your desires,

161
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,140
 it's not going to give you peace,

162
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,240
 it's going to make you anxious.

163
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,200
 It's going to make you more anxious.

164
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,880
 You're gonna have anxiety.

165
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,400
 Black Friday is like stressful.

166
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
 It's unbelievably stressful.

167
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,120
 It causes anxiety in me just thinking about it.

168
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,240
 It's the opposite of peace.

169
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
 It's the opposite of contentment in every way.

170
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,620
 And so if you're here and you struggle with anxiety,

171
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,360
 let me just say something up front.

172
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,000
 There's times in your life where you're not anxious.

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
 Almost every person that I've met with

174
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,040
 that struggles with anxiety would say,

175
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,680
 "Yeah, there's times in my life where I'm not anxious."

176
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,400
 And I can say, "Well, describe those times to me."

177
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,800
 And they would tell me, and say, "Well, what if,"

178
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,200
 let me just propose something to you.

179
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,840
 "What if the times that you're anxious

180
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,320
 "are because you have a perspective problem?"

181
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,280
 Because there's times you're not anxious,

182
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,600
 and so what is your perspective then?

183
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,080
 And then there's times you are anxious,

184
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,040
 and so if there's times that you're not anxious,

185
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,360
 what if the times that you are anxious

186
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,760
 is simply a perspective problem?

187
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,240
 What if you're being ruled by the wrong things?

188
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,040
 Now, I'm not trying to dumb down your struggle,

189
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,480
 so stay with me, and certainly there's exceptions, I'm sure,

190
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,880
 and maybe you think you're the exception, and so be it.

191
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,020
 But I'm just saying, hey, what if?

192
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,640
 What if it's a perspective problem?

193
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,320
 What if we are being ruled by the wrong things,

194
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,320
 and that is causing anxiety in our lives?

195
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,320
 And so tonight, I wanna talk about

196
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,560
 being ruled by the right thing,

197
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,280
 being ruled by God so we can exhale.

198
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,040
 We're wrapping up this series, Exhale,

199
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,120
 so tonight we're talking about being ruled by God

200
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,880
 so that we can exhale.

201
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,260
 And so I'm gonna give you three things

202
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,080
 that people who are ruled by God do.

203
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,400
 And so in verses one through four of Psalm 16,

204
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,600
 we're gonna talk about how they delight in his people.

205
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
 In verses five through eight,

206
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,240
 we're gonna talk about how they find joy in his presence,

207
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,560
 and in verses nine through 11,

208
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,220
 we're gonna talk about how they pursue

209
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,780
 the pleasures of eternity.

210
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,120
 And so if you wanna turn to Psalm 16,

211
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,880
 if you just kinda crack your Bible open

212
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,320
 right there in the middle, you should be in the Psalms,

213
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,960
 and you can turn to chapter 16,

214
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,820
 and we will cover the entire chapter this evening.

215
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,120
 This Psalm was written by David,

216
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,600
 like so many of the Psalms in the Psalms,

217
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,720
 and like so many that we've covered already.

218
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,200
 David is the one who said, "The Lord is my shepherd."

219
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
 That was David.

220
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
 David is David and Goliath, David and Bathsheba.

221
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,040
 David, the greatest king this world has ever known,

222
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,200
 aside from King Jesus, that David.

223
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,560
 And so this is David.

224
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,800
 He scribed this Psalm about 1,040 years

225
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,920
 before Jesus shows up on the scene.

226
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,720
 So about 1,044 BC, before Christ, David writes this.

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
 "It's known as the Golden Psalm of David."

228
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,000
 And he says this, verse one.

229
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,280
 "Keep me safe, my God, for in you I take refuge.

230
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,940
 "I say to the Lord, you are my Lord.

231
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,800
 "Apart from you, I have no good thing."

232
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,760
 Okay, what is he saying there?

233
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,200
 In the Hebrew, he's saying, "I say to Jehovah,

234
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,160
 "I say to Jehovah, you are my Adonai."

235
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,400
 It says Lord twice, but you'll notice one Lord

236
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,120
 in your Bible might be in all caps,

237
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,960
 and the other Lord is just a capital L.

238
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,960
 "I say to the Lord, Jehovah," a name only for God,

239
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,680
 "you are my Adonai, you are my ruler, you are my king.

240
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,100
 "You are the one in my life who is in charge of me.

241
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,920
 "I'm submissive to you.

242
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,300
 "I say to God, you are my Lord.

243
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,000
 "Apart from you, I have no good thing.

244
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,380
 "I say to the holy people who are in the land,

245
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,840
 "they are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.

246
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,620
 "Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more.

247
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,840
 "I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods

248
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,080
 "or take up their names on my lips."

249
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,280
 He describes two types of people,

250
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,800
 people who are on the right path to God

251
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,880
 and people who are on the wrong path,

252
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,120
 people on the narrow path and people on the wide path.

253
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,200
 And so let me ask you this question

254
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,040
 before we go any further.

255
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,240
 If you still have your cell phones out,

256
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
 you might even just type it in there.

257
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
 I'm gonna ask you a question.

258
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,480
 I want you to answer literally, not out loud,

259
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,920
 but in your mind or write it down or something.

260
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,080
 Who do you want to be like?

261
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,280
 I know this is church, I'm not talking about Jesus, Jesus.

262
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,240
 No, no, who do you know or know of alive today

263
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,440
 that you want to be like?

264
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,720
 Who do you most wanna be like?

265
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,640
 Like I wanna be her, like she has him

266
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,560
 and I want all his, his job, his car.

267
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,680
 Who, think of a person, a name.

268
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,400
 Who do you want to be like?

269
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
 Everybody got it?

270
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,200
 Nods, you got a name?

271
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
 I might call on you.

272
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,160
 No, you got a name?

273
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,620
 Okay, let me ask you another question.

274
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,320
 Who is the holiest person alive that you can think of?

275
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,220
 Who do you know who is the holiest person?

276
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,780
 Most conformed to Christ's character and his likeness.

277
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,800
 Who do you know that is the,

278
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,900
 who's the holiest person you know?

279
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,000
 Think of another name.

280
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,160
 Let me ask you a third question.

281
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,640
 If those two names are different, why?

282
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,640
 If you just thought of two different names,

283
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,920
 well, there's the holiest person

284
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,960
 and then the person I most wanna be like.

285
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,040
 Why would those be different?

286
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,560
 Why would you not wanna be just like the person

287
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,960
 who is most like Christ in your life?

288
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,380
 And so my first point from this text is

289
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,340
 when God is your Lord, you, number one,

290
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,540
 delight in his people.

291
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,460
 When God is your Lord, when God is your ruler,

292
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,620
 when you're submissive to God,

293
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,060
 you're in a relationship with God,

294
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,780
 you know that he's God and you're not,

295
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,700
 and you want him to rule in your life,

296
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,260
 when God is your Lord, you delight in his people.

297
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,220
 With God as your ruler,

298
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,240
 you do not hang out with whoever you want to.

299
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,700
 When God is your ruler,

300
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,500
 you hang out with who he wants you to.

301
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,700
 And those may be two different people.

302
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,980
 And so you have friends that kind of allow you to exhale,

303
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,700
 friends who carry burdens with you,

304
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,180
 friends who celebrate victories with you.

305
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,020
 And then you have friends that you do ministry to.

306
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,260
 You have friends you do ministry with

307
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,620
 and you have friends you do ministry to.

308
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,620
 Let me say it like this.

309
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,580
 There are only two types of people you know

310
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,300
 if you're here and you're a follower of Christ.

311
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,140
 People you do ministry with and people you do ministry to.

312
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,600
 There are no other people.

313
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,140
 That's it.

314
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,500
 That is everyone in your life

315
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,740
 if you are a follower of Christ.

316
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,500
 There are those you do ministry with

317
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,600
 and those you do ministry to.

318
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,900
 And so he's talking about,

319
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,540
 hey, I delight in the ones who know Jesus Christ

320
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,980
 as their Lord and they're following him.

321
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,660
 And so to understand this, we have to unlearn some things

322
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,780
 'cause I'll talk to people and they're like,

323
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,660
 well, most people are Christians though.

324
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,580
 Most people, they believe in God.

325
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,060
 Most people are Christians.

326
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,780
 Most people are gonna go to heaven.

327
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,420
 On the contrary, Jesus said most people

328
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,460
 are gonna go to hell.

329
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,780
 Do we understand that?

330
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,540
 Jesus says that most people alive are gonna go to hell.

331
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,100
 It's heavy.

332
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,940
 And you say, well, where does he say that?

333
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,860
 He says that in Matthew 7.

334
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,100
 He says, "Wide is the road that leads to destruction

335
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,060
 "and many are on that wide path,

336
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,880
 "but narrow is the path that leads to life

337
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,540
 "and few will find it."

338
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,420
 He is the gate, he's the way, he's the path to life.

339
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,660
 He says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.

340
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,180
 "No one comes to the Father except through me."

341
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,460
 He says, "Most people will be separated from me

342
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,580
 "forever and ever and ever because they've rejected me."

343
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,720
 Those are the ones you do ministry to.

344
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,620
 And then there's those who have trusted in who I am,

345
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,340
 King Jesus, those are the ones you do ministry with.

346
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,780
 So he's not talking about the one who pursues

347
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,980
 the gods of this world.

348
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,020
 He says, "I can't even speak of their gods."

349
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,740
 As my friend Garrett says, "Those who worship power,

350
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,860
 "pleasure, and pennies will experience pain."

351
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,140
 Those who worship power, pleasure, and pennies

352
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,580
 will experience pain.

353
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,500
 And so a lot of us, so many of us here tonight,

354
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,820
 we value people based on worldly standards.

355
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,620
 We value people based on what they can do for us,

356
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,660
 what they have, who they have connections to.

357
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,060
 We see them like Satan sees them.

358
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,940
 We see them like the world sees them.

359
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,740
 We do not see people like God sees people for some of us.

360
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,740
 We don't see them for how holy they are,

361
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,140
 how devoted to him they are.

362
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,980
 That's who we wanna be around.

363
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,820
 Very relevant to dating, by the way.

364
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,640
 Fellas, there are some very, very godly women around you

365
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,420
 whom you've ignored because you've been brainwashed

366
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,260
 by the world.

367
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,240
 Think about that.

368
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:56,260
 First Corinthians 15, verse 33 says, "Do not be misled.

369
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,940
 "Bad company corrupts good character.

370
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,580
 "Come back to your senses as you ought and stop sinning,

371
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,440
 "for there are some who are ignorant of God."

372
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,880
 Don't make, don't fellowship with those

373
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,120
 who are ignorant of God.

374
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,440
 This is for some of you, you got a friend problem, man.

375
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,400
 Like a dog to his vomit, you keep returning to the same sins

376
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,080
 over and over and over.

377
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,520
 And when you look around you, the same people are there.

378
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,600
 You're doing the same things with the same people

379
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,400
 and you want different returns.

380
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,120
 You've gotta change your playmates in your playground.

381
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,480
 You've got a playmate in playground problem.

382
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,640
 And your friends are an idol.

383
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,600
 You're like, no, no, no, no.

384
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,560
 Don't make me get rid of my friends.

385
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,220
 I'm trying to show you life, man.

386
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,820
 I'm trying to set you free.

387
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,320
 Jesus is trying to set you free.

388
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,500
 David is trying to set you free.

389
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,040
 The Holy Spirit is trying to set you free.

390
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,300
 When I question whether I should hang out with someone

391
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,660
 or some people, I ask this question,

392
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,500
 will I have influence or will I be influenced?

393
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,940
 'Cause if I will be influenced toward their gods,

394
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,620
 I'm not gonna hang out.

395
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,980
 But if I can influence them toward my one true God,

396
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,220
 I'm all about it.

397
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,540
 You should only fellowship,

398
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,700
 let me say this really controversial statement

399
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,180
 in case you're not already angry at me.

400
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,600
 You should only hang out with people

401
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,380
 you intend to see in eternity.

402
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,720
 Okay, you can write that down, tweet it out,

403
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,860
 lose some Facebook friends.

404
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,160
 Let me say it again, okay?

405
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,700
 You should only hang out with people

406
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,660
 you intend to see in eternity.

407
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,500
 Is that true?

408
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,940
 (audience laughing)

409
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,380
 Key word being intend.

410
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,900
 Let me make, am I saying you should only hang out

411
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,060
 with Christians, no.

412
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,260
 I'm saying you should hang out with non-believers

413
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,240
 for the sake of pointing them to Christ.

414
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,560
 You should hang out with Christians

415
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,180
 for the sake of knowing God more

416
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,300
 and celebrating who God is and what he's done.

417
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,420
 And you should hang out with those who are not Christians

418
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,260
 because you intend to see them in heaven.

419
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,260
 You want to see them in the kingdom of God forever.

420
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,100
 You want them to be there with you.

421
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,380
 And so you're intentional in the relationship.

422
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,040
 You are living life on purpose,

423
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,980
 but you should only hang out with people

424
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,900
 whom you intend to see in the kingdom.

425
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,660
 That is a life on purpose.

426
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,340
 That's why you're alive.

427
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,300
 That's why you have breath in your lungs.

428
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,940
 That's why God left you here after he saved you

429
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,300
 and he didn't take you home in that moment.

430
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,940
 And you say, wait, Jesus hung out with sinners.

431
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,340
 Absolutely, for the intentions

432
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,240
 of seeing them in heaven, he did.

433
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,820
 So, all of our relationships,

434
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,020
 we have an internal impact.

435
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,920
 We delight in believers and we seek to share.

436
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,760
 That's verse three.

437
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,300
 We seek to share with non-believers.

438
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,620
 That's verse four.

439
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,280
 We do ministry with people or to people

440
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,580
 and that's living on purpose.

441
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
 Let me say it like this.

442
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,820
 When we see people in light of eternity,

443
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,180
 we prioritize relationships differently.

444
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,220
 Did you hear me?

445
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,940
 When we see people in light of eternity,

446
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,240
 we prioritize relationships differently.

447
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,440
 We don't belong to this fallen world.

448
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,680
 If you're in the kingdom, this is not your home, man.

449
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,520
 You're not home yet.

450
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,740
 You're just in the preview.

451
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,540
 You're just in this middle round.

452
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,460
 You're just in this middle realm.

453
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,560
 You're not home yet.

454
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,580
 My little girl, my eight-year-old, Presley,

455
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,460
 I'll premise this by just saying,

456
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,820
 hey, we have the birds and the bees talk early in my home.

457
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,900
 So, that will make sense in a minute.

458
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,140
 And so, she comes down the stairs

459
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,980
 singing Drake's "Hotline Bling."

460
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,880
 And so, she comes in and she's like,

461
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,860
 ♪ You used to call me on my cell phone ♪

462
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,580
 ♪ You used to call me when you need my love ♪

463
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,180
 I'm like, who used to call you?

464
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,180
 (congregation laughing)

465
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,860
 And she's like, ♪ 'Cause you know in that ♪

466
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,300
 ♪ Hotline Bling ♪

467
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,900
 ♪ That can only mean one thing ♪

468
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,060
 I go, hey, Presley, what's it mean?

469
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,360
 She's like, what are you talking about?

470
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,100
 I go, you said it can only mean one thing.

471
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,940
 What's it mean?

472
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,760
 What are you saying?

473
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,600
 What's it mean?

474
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,100
 She go, I don't know.

475
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,260
 (congregation laughing)

476
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,560
 I said, well, you sang it.

477
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,620
 I said, I know what it means.

478
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,460
 You want me to tell you?

479
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,540
 She goes, yeah, yeah, tell me.

480
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,140
 This is a booty call.

481
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,260
 (congregation laughing)

482
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,100
 She like looked at me confused, like.

483
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,900
 (congregation laughing)

484
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,140
 Said, Dave, what's a booty call?

485
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,100
 (congregation laughing)

486
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,540
 I said, it's a guy who's lonely

487
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,540
 and he's calling someone he's not married to

488
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,780
 because he wants to have sex with her.

489
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,420
 Do you know that's what you were singing?

490
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,540
 No, no, I didn't know.

491
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,860
 She goes, everybody sings this song.

492
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,120
 I said, you're right, everybody sings this song.

493
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,500
 Everybody, you're right.

494
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,180
 Gets in your head, you can't get it out.

495
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,480
 Everybody sings this song.

496
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,860
 I said, you're not everybody, Presley.

497
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,160
 I said, you're a princess.

498
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,780
 I said, you belong to a king.

499
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,460
 You belong to a king in a foreign land.

500
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,620
 He's gonna call you home one day.

501
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,220
 You're gonna be with him in his kingdom.

502
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,500
 There where he reigns,

503
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,300
 you're gonna be there in his presence

504
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,360
 forever and ever and ever and ever.

505
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,580
 You're not everybody.

506
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,100
 Yes, though, everybody in the world sings that song.

507
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,800
 They worship other gods with their lips,

508
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,620
 but we don't even utter the names

509
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,720
 of those gods with our lips.

510
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,660
 We sing praises to the one true God.

511
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,380
 We don't mindlessly be brainwashed by words

512
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,380
 with a fun beat behind them.

513
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,320
 You're a princess, Presley.

514
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,980
 You belong to a king.

515
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,820
 Verse five.

516
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,000
 Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup.

517
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,740
 You make my lot secure.

518
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,540
 He says, God is what he needs.

519
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,300
 He says, you're my portion, God.

520
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,460
 You're my portion.

521
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,420
 By show of hands, how many of you here

522
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,060
 ate an amazing Thanksgiving meal?

523
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,440
 Like you went big, like me and Shane, evidently.

524
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,660
 You went big.

525
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,180
 Thanksgiving, yeah, why are you not raising your hand?

526
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,560
 Big Thanksgiving meal, okay.

527
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,540
 Now, how many that just raised their hand,

528
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,740
 how many went back for seconds?

529
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,860
 All right, good, yeah, yeah.

530
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,860
 I went, me too, me too.

531
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,740
 Okay, so now just, we're gonna take another survey

532
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,940
 real quick, so how many of you,

533
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,040
 when you go back for seconds,

534
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,980
 like you want that one more thing, is it turkey?

535
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,980
 How many went back for seconds on turkey?

536
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,140
 Some of you, yeah, turkey's kind of a waste of space.

537
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,980
 How many dressing?

538
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,460
 Oh yeah, big time, that's me.

539
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,980
 I'm in that camp firmly.

540
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,940
 And then how many of that one side that only mama makes,

541
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,740
 it's amazing, it only shows up at Thanksgiving?

542
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,100
 Okay, yeah, yeah, I feel that.

543
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,580
 And then how many of you went twice through the dessert line?

544
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,500
 Like pumpkin pie, yeah, me too, me too, right?

545
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,000
 It's like that, it's like I've gotta get that other portion.

546
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,500
 I've gotta get that one more thing.

547
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,260
 David's saying, hey, God, is that for me?

548
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,820
 That thing that I'm excited about,

549
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,900
 that thing that I can't get enough of,

550
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,500
 that thing that I just want more of,

551
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,700
 that thing that I'm thinking of,

552
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,500
 it's God, the creator of the heavens and the earth.

553
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,180
 I want more of you, you're my portions.

554
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,380
 You make my lots secure.

555
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,580
 The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places.

556
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,060
 Surely I have a delightful inheritance.

557
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,140
 What an incredible line of contentment.

558
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,740
 That should be your new favorite verse,

559
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,180
 at least for the evening.

560
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,160
 Look at how beautiful this is.

561
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,360
 The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places.

562
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,440
 Surely I have a delightful inheritance.

563
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,960
 He says, everywhere I am, I see in light of where I will be.

564
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,160
 And so I'm content.

565
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,800
 No matter where I am, I see it through the lens

566
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,760
 of being with you forever and ever and ever and ever,

567
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,660
 and so I have contentment perspective.

568
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,680
 What an incredible perspective.

569
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,800
 I will praise the Lord who counsels me,

570
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,360
 even at night my heart instructs me.

571
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,560
 This is the picture of a man who's lying in bed

572
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,960
 thinking about what is right.

573
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,880
 Really powerful image.

574
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,460
 Lady, this is who you want to marry.

575
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,880
 A man who is lying in his bed,

576
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,640
 reflecting on the goodness of God,

577
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,040
 saying, hey, what is the right thing to do

578
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,880
 so I can do that?

579
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,760
 I only wanna do what is right.

580
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,560
 May your Holy Spirit instruct me

581
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,320
 to do only what is good and right and true.

582
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,360
 I keep my eyes always on the Lord.

583
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,920
 With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.

584
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,680
 I don't care if there's a Goliath nine feet tall

585
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,040
 in front of me, give me a rock.

586
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,000
 I won't be shaken with you.

587
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,720
 You have my lot secure.

588
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,400
 God, Jehovah, you are my Adonai, you are my Lord.

589
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,040
 When God is your Lord, you find joy in his presence.

590
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,520
 You find joy in his presence.

591
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,800
 You find joy in his presence.

592
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,160
 Let me say this, friends.

593
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,560
 You need to hear this, okay?

594
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,720
 You really need to hear what I'm about to say.

595
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,080
 If you're not actively spending intentional time with God,

596
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,800
 you should reevaluate what you actually believe about God.

597
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,160
 Lest you fool yourself into thinking

598
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,060
 that you have a relationship with God.

599
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,260
 If you are not actively, intentionally setting your time

600
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,860
 aside so that you might be with the creator

601
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,980
 of the heavens and the earth who formed you

602
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,640
 in your mother's womb as we sang earlier.

603
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,380
 If you are not seeking to know him

604
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,540
 and prioritizing time with him,

605
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,860
 then you might reevaluate what you actually believe

606
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,820
 about him.

607
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,980
 You might reconsider what you believe about that God

608
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,420
 you don't want to spend time with.

609
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,060
 To you, I say, no wonder you're stressed out.

610
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,380
 You haven't made time for the most important thing

611
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,920
 in the entire world, entire universe.

612
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,540
 No wonder you're stressed out.

613
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,740
 It is very counterintuitive to say, I have so much to do.

614
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,300
 I need to spend time with God.

615
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,300
 But it's the only way you're gonna get through

616
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,500
 the so much to do.

617
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,420
 He's the only way, with sanity anyways.

618
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,020
 I had this friend, it's a crazy story.

619
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,060
 Crazy story, let me premise it with that.

620
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,460
 A buddy, my close friend of mine, honestly,

621
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,740
 and he was in ministry, vocational ministry.

622
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,740
 He was a pastor.

623
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,900
 And he started dating this girl.

624
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,460
 Talk about her all the time, this girl.

625
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,980
 And she was kind of a well-known girl.

626
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,060
 She was well-known in the Christian circle.

627
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,420
 She was a Christian artist, a singer.

628
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,460
 And so, he would just talk about her.

629
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,020
 And I never met her, I never saw her.

630
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,980
 I never saw him with her.

631
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,000
 And we worked closely together

632
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,580
 and spent a lot of time together.

633
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,140
 And he would show me pictures.

634
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,780
 And he'd be like, hey, here's.

635
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,000
 But the pictures were weird.

636
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,900
 It was like, here I am, and then there she is.

637
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,500
 And then here I am.

638
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,660
 And there were never any pictures of them together.

639
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,020
 And I didn't even catch on to it

640
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,220
 because I trusted him.

641
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,580
 And he would just always, he was talking about,

642
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,580
 hey, I think I'm gonna marry this girl.

643
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,700
 And all of this stuff, like him and this relationship.

644
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,780
 And as it went on, he was exposed.

645
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,120
 This girl that he was never with,

646
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,320
 he didn't actually have a relationship with.

647
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,200
 And he had gone to, he was a fraud.

648
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,760
 And he had gone to great lengths

649
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,720
 to convince people in his life

650
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,700
 that he had a relationship with her.

651
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,080
 And I think today, I look back on that,

652
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,040
 I think how exhausting

653
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,980
 to manage that perception that he actually knew and loved

654
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,900
 and was in relationship with this person

655
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,980
 that he never spent any time with.

656
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,840
 And some of us are doing that with God.

657
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,100
 And I think how exhausting for you to go through life

658
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,160
 trying to trick the world that you have a relationship

659
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,000
 with the creator of the heavens and the earth

660
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,220
 when you don't spend any time with him.

661
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,280
 How exhausting that must be for you

662
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,340
 to try to manage that perception.

663
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:47,700
 David says, "The thought of my inheritance with you

664
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,420
 "gives me peace in the places I'm at."

665
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,360
 He says, "Boundary lines have fallen in pleasant places."

666
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,340
 He says, "The Lord is in charge of where I live,"

667
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,120
 verse six, "He knows where I'm gonna be

668
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,020
 "and I'm content there

669
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,980
 "because I see it in light of eternity."

670
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,960
 He says, "I have pleasure in them."

671
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,940
 Every pleasure that you experience here

672
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,180
 is one of two things.

673
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,180
 It's either counterfeit or a commercial.

674
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,200
 So it's either a fake temporary pleasure

675
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,300
 that's gonna leave you wanting more,

676
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,780
 or it's a commercial for the kingdom of God.

677
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,740
 It's this, when you sit with friends and you fellowship

678
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,480
 and the sun's breaking through the leaves

679
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,380
 on a perfect fall day and you feel the breeze

680
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,780
 and the weather is perfect and you laugh until you cry,

681
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,900
 and there's just this sense that all is right in the world,

682
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,820
 it's just a commercial of the forever

683
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,360
 and ever and ever with Jesus.

684
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,180
 And in that moment that you think, I'm gonna eat,

685
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,460
 I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go hard, I'm gonna get mine,

686
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,420
 I'm gonna take, I want, I'm gonna devour.

687
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,080
 It's counterfeit, leaves you wanting more.

688
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,360
 On the other end of it, there's a, what did I do?

689
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,880
 What was I thinking?

690
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,040
 Why did I do that again?

691
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,880
 It's counterfeit.

692
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,000
 See, we're going through this world

693
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,640
 as followers of Christ, content, full on Him,

694
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,320
 satisfied, He's our portion.

695
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,440
 We're not going through this world like,

696
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,320
 you guys go to the grocery store,

697
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,080
 you ever go to the grocery store hungry?

698
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,280
 It's a terrible idea.

699
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,000
 Is it not a terrible idea?

700
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,100
 You go to the grocery store hungry,

701
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,620
 like you go in for just milk, but you're hungry.

702
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,420
 And so you're like, you're like going, where's the milk?

703
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,260
 Where's the milk?

704
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,080
 Oh, look at this yogurt.

705
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,100
 Wow, okay, I think I saw that commercial,

706
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,940
 I'll get some yogurt.

707
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,220
 And you're like, oh, Eggo waffles, all right,

708
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,580
 Eggo waffles, and then, oh, Captain Crunch, yummy,

709
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,300
 you know, it's got a prize in the box, dad life, you know?

710
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,940
 And so, and you just, oh, I saw a commercial for this drink,

711
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,420
 I'll buy a pack of that.

712
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,620
 And all of a sudden, before you know,

713
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,580
 you were in there for just milk,

714
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,940
 and you got all this stuff, right?

715
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,740
 And you're just trying to fill the contentment

716
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,460
 in your heart, like for my wife,

717
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,980
 she goes for milk and comes back with a dress,

718
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,820
 like Super Target, I hate you, you know?

719
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,020
 Like when I was growing up, you'd get beat up

720
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,540
 if you bought clothes at the grocery store.

721
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,540
 Like I got beat up for buying clothes at the grocery store.

722
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,420
 Now Target made it cool somehow.

723
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,260
 And so she goes in like, hey, just grab a gallon of milk.

724
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,580
 And she goes, look at these shoes, and it matches.

725
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,380
 And that's not how we go through this world.

726
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,460
 So you don't do that when you have a pantry full of food.

727
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,900
 You don't do that when you have everything you need.

728
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,020
 You do that when you're wanting.

729
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,820
 You don't do that when you're satisfied.

730
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,580
 As followers of Christ, we go through this world

731
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,660
 satisfied on Him, longing for a future world,

732
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,540
 longing for a right world, a correct world,

733
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,620
 a sinless world with God in His presence.

734
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:35,180
 Don't try to fill an eternal void with stuff here.

735
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,400
 Let eternity do that.

736
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,940
 Verse nine, "Therefore, my heart is glad

737
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,060
 "and my tongue rejoices."

738
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,300
 Why, why is his heart glad?

739
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,300
 Why does his tongue rejoice?

740
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,540
 "Because my body will also rest secure.

741
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,820
 "Because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,"

742
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,500
 that's hell, "nor will you let your faithful one,"

743
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,560
 or your Bible might say holy one,

744
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,580
 "nor will you let your holy one see decay."

745
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,720
 Now that's, what's he saying here?

746
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,180
 Because this is weird because it sounds like he's saying,

747
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,540
 hey God, you're not gonna let me die.

748
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,480
 But in 2 Samuel, verse seven,

749
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,100
 God told David he was gonna die.

750
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,220
 He told him that his body would decay.

751
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,420
 And so why is he saying this?

752
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,820
 And so, you know, Psalms are interesting.

753
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,900
 Like when I read the Psalms, it's like I don't know them.

754
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,660
 It's like I'm reading them for the first time.

755
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,620
 And whenever I'm gonna teach on something,

756
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,620
 I'll listen to messages.

757
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,540
 And when I went to teach on Psalm 16 for the first time,

758
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,060
 you know that I couldn't find another message on Psalm 16.

759
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,560
 I couldn't even find a commentary

760
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,900
 that I really loved on Psalm 16.

761
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
 And so I was looking,

762
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,280
 and so I'll listen to other preachers take on a message.

763
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,340
 I'll listen to what they did with it.

764
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,480
 And before I teach it,

765
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,020
 I just couldn't find any resources on Psalm 16

766
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,300
 when I first taught this.

767
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,220
 And do you know who wrote the best commentary on Psalm 16?

768
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,800
 It wasn't John Piper.

769
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,900
 Do you know who wrote the best commentary on Psalm 16?

770
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,660
 It was the Holy Spirit.

771
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,740
 Did you know, Ports,

772
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,380
 did you know that the first sermon ever preached

773
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,460
 in the church was on Psalm 16?

774
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,740
 So after Jesus left,

775
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,020
 the first sermon ever preached was on Psalm 16.

776
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,420
 It was the apostle Peter.

777
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,620
 He says this in Acts chapter two.

778
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,060
 He says, "You Jews, you Jews, you killed Jesus."

779
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,220
 But verse 24, "God raised him, Jesus, from the dead,

780
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,740
 "freeing him from the agony of death

781
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,160
 "because it was impossible for death

782
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,380
 "to keep its hold on him.

783
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,180
 "David said about him," this is King David in Psalm 16,

784
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,180
 "said about Jesus, 'I saw the Lord always before me

785
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,660
 "'because he is at my right hand.

786
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,900
 "'I will not be shaken.'"

787
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,120
 Talking about Jesus.

788
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,580
 "Therefore, my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices.

789
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,340
 "My body also will rest in hope

790
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,780
 "because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,

791
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,340
 "nor will you let your body,

792
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,000
 "nor will you let your Holy One see decay.

793
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,920
 "You have made known to me the paths of life.

794
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,500
 "You will fill me with joy in your presence."

795
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,660
 That's Psalm 16.

796
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
 And he says this, the commentary then.

797
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,840
 "Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently

798
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,940
 "that the patriarch David did.

799
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,500
 "He died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.

800
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,880
 "We can go to his tomb, his body is decaying.

801
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,900
 "But he was a prophet, and he knew that Jesus

802
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,100
 "had promised him on an oath

803
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,940
 "that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.

804
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,500
 "Seeing what was to come,

805
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,780
 "he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah

806
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,780
 "that was not abandoned to the realm of the dead,

807
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,220
 "nor did his body see decay.

808
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,860
 "He was resurrected on the third day.

809
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,580
 "God raised this Jesus to life,

810
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,060
 "and we are all witnesses of it."

811
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,020
 We saw him, we saw him.

812
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,440
 He said, "David, a thousand years

813
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,240
 "before Jesus shows up on the scene,

814
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,200
 "David's talking about Jesus."

815
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,380
 And you're like, "Well, how do we know?"

816
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,380
 Did you know the apostle Paul preached a sermon on Psalm 16?

817
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,820
 That was Peter, not to be confused with Paul in Acts 13,

818
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,180
 says this, verse 35, "You will not let your Holy One

819
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,260
 "see decay," David said that in Psalm 16.

820
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,340
 Now, when David had served God's purpose

821
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,340
 in his own generation, he fell asleep.

822
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,980
 He was buried with his ancestors, and his body decayed.

823
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,260
 But the one whom God raised from the dead

824
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,100
 did not see decay, that was Jesus.

825
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,500
 Therefore, my friends, I want you to know

826
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,420
 that through Jesus, the forgiveness of sins

827
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,640
 is proclaimed to you.

828
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,020
 Through him, everyone who believes

829
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,660
 is set free from every sin.

830
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:13,660
 What I'm saying is 2015 years ago,

831
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,620
 there were no prophets speaking the word of God.

832
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,060
 There was 400 years of silence.

833
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,120
 And God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,

834
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,020
 broke the silence with, you know what?

835
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,780
 The sound, God's first words after 400 years of silence

836
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,300
 were the cry of an infant in a manger,

837
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:42,580
 a newborn baby in fulfillment with God's promises.

838
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,380
 David looked ahead and foresaw that God

839
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,860
 was gonna come to the earth in the form of a man,

840
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,180
 live a sinless life, and die the death that you deserve.

841
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:57,160
 The death that you deserve, the torture that you deserve,

842
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,200
 so that you might have the inheritance that he deserves.

843
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,200
 As a perfect God, the prince to the greatest king

844
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,920
 creation will ever know.

845
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,800
 David saw that.

846
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,380
 So Jesus is the way.

847
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,300
 He's the life, he's the truth, he's the door,

848
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,240
 he's the gate, he's the road you take,

849
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,520
 he's everything, heaven is his party.

850
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,200
 He's in charge of the guest list.

851
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
 He determines who will get in there,

852
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,920
 and he will fill you with joy in his presence.

853
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,200
 And so how can we trust the promises of eternity?

854
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,240
 Because God always keeps his promises.

855
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,040
 He kept his promise.

856
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,880
 When Jesus showed up the first time, he's coming back, guys.

857
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,240
 He's coming, he's returning for us

858
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,420
 to take his prince and his princesses home with him,

859
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,760
 to be with him and his land forever.

860
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,480
 When God is your Lord, you, third point,

861
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,320
 pursue eternal pleasures.

862
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,180
 When God is your Lord, you pursue eternal pleasures.

863
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,500
 Verse 11, it's a beautiful verse, listen.

864
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,660
 You make known to me the path of life.

865
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:14,060
 You will fill me with joy in your presence,

866
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,460
 with eternal pleasures at your right hand.

867
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:21,140
 He's saying this, the future, or the hope, rather,

868
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,860
 of future pleasures help us resist

869
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,300
 the temptation of fleeting pleasures.

870
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,500
 The hope of future pleasures help us resist

871
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,740
 the temptation of fleeting pleasures.

872
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,820
 Because what you think about eternity

873
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,340
 determines how you live here.

874
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,820
 What you actually believe about eternity

875
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,860
 determines how you live here.

876
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,220
 You guys ever been at work?

877
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,820
 You're like, yeah, I've been at work.

878
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,480
 You ever been at work right before a vacation?

879
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,780
 Like you're about to leave on vacation.

880
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,060
 Maybe this was two weeks ago for you.

881
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,940
 Maybe you went on vacation, Thanksgiving,

882
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,260
 and you're at work, and normally it'd be a really bad day.

883
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,180
 But this day you're about to go on vacation.

884
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,940
 And they come to you, they're like,

885
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,020
 "No, things are blowing up."

886
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,820
 You're like, "Eh, I'm about to go on vacation."

887
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,300
 They're like, "No, literally the copy machine's on fire."

888
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,200
 "Eh, it's okay, vacation."

889
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,900
 They're like, "No, but we just lost the deal.

890
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,320
 "You don't understand."

891
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,320
 "Eh, beaches, mountains, turkey, dressing, vacation."

892
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,900
 You know, it's coming, right?

893
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,060
 And so it's just like you just kind of have this perspective

894
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,460
 like, eh, right?

895
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,980
 But no, but you're usually really anxious right now.

896
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,840
 Yeah, but I'm going on vacation.

897
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,640
 So I'm not.

898
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,500
 But you might get fired.

899
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,620
 More vacation.

900
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,040
 [congregation laughing]

901
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,940
 If you're a Christ follower, like this is your life.

902
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,380
 You're about to go on vacation.

903
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,780
 That's today, man.

904
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,300
 Like you're about to be with God forever and ever

905
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,500
 and ever and ever in his kingdom.

906
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,580
 Like it's better than Disney World,

907
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,680
 better than beaches, better than mountains.

908
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,660
 You're on vacation.

909
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,660
 But things are going really wrong.

910
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,220
 Eh, I'm about to go to heaven.

911
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,300
 That's like in 80 years.

912
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,780
 Yeah, but it's forever.

913
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,180
 I'll be there forever, man.

914
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,420
 It won't matter 80 years from now.

915
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,260
 I have to go to heaven.

916
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,260
 That's perspective.

917
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,180
 Do you see how anxiety can be a perspective problem?

918
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,860
 [congregation laughing]

919
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,700
 Exhale.

920
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,460
 See, how do you know your stress

921
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,900
 is not a perspective problem?

922
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,260
 When we see problems in light of the promise of eternity,

923
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,180
 we persevere.

924
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,380
 When we see problems in light of the promise of eternity,

925
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,220
 we persevere.

926
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,340
 I literally, in conversations with some believers,

927
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,840
 I'm like, yeah, I pray to die.

928
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,780
 They're like, what?

929
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,820
 I was like, yeah, man, sometimes.

930
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,980
 I'm just like saying my prayers.

931
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,660
 I'm like, Jesus, come tonight.

932
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,500
 Take me home tonight.

933
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,620
 I wanna be with you.

934
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,540
 I wanna be with you that bad.

935
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,620
 Will you just take me home?

936
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,180
 And I'm not depressed or anything.

937
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,220
 Pray for me if you want.

938
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,140
 [congregation laughing]

939
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,940
 I'm just like, no, man, I just wanna meet King Jesus.

940
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,140
 I just wanna be in his presence.

941
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,100
 And some friends were like, man, that's crazy,

942
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,060
 but don't you wanna walk your girls down the aisle?

943
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,900
 Like, yeah.

944
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,060
 Yeah, I mean, I wanna walk my girls down the aisle,

945
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,140
 but walking them down the aisle or meeting Jesus,

946
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,660
 I'll take Jesus.

947
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,620
 I love my girls, but give me Jesus.

948
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,860
 And like single folks sometimes are like,

949
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,020
 yeah, no, I wanna meet Jesus.

950
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,380
 I just wanna get married first.

951
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,220
 Like, what?

952
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,060
 Are you serious?

953
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,020
 Like, you can go to a wedding that you paid for,

954
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,180
 or you can be at God's wedding feast.

955
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,220
 Like, you get to choose.

956
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,540
 And you're saying, I'd rather go to the wedding

957
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,420
 that I paid for first.

958
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,460
 I just wanna experience that.

959
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,660
 Like, nobody's gonna get to heaven and be like,

960
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,620
 man, I missed out on that whole marriage thing, you know?

961
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,620
 Jeez, God, why'd you do that to me?

962
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,020
 No, man, it's heaven.

963
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,420
 It's heaven.

964
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,740
 It's heaven with God forever and ever and ever.

965
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,100
 You live with that perspective.

966
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,820
 Like, I'm on vacation before heaven, before eternity.

967
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,180
 What problems do I got, man?

968
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,020
 Go into heaven.

969
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,700
 People are like, what about Monica and the kids?

970
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,140
 Who's gonna take care of 'em?

971
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,260
 Well, God is.

972
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,580
 God's gonna take care of 'em.

973
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,980
 God's taking care of 'em right now.

974
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,900
 He's just using me.

975
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,900
 If I die, he'll use somebody else.

976
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,220
 I hope he's handsome.

977
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,020
 (congregation laughing)

978
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,140
 Listen to this, verse 11.

979
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,980
 It's beautiful.

980
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,820
 I read it once.

981
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,660
 I'm gonna read it again.

982
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,500
 I wanna show you something.

983
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,260
 There's an alliteration here in the English.

984
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,740
 I like Ps, as you can tell.

985
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,220
 So, "You make known to me the path of life.

986
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,900
 "You fill me with joy in your presence,

987
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,260
 "with eternal pleasures at your right hand."

988
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,340
 You see that?

989
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,140
 "The path of life, it's with God's people.

990
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,820
 "You fill me with joy in your presence."

991
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,500
 That's who people, when God is the Lord of their life,

992
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,860
 they have joy in his presence.

993
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,700
 With eternal pleasures at your right hand,

994
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,460
 we pursue eternal pleasures

995
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,420
 when God is the Lord of our life.

996
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,660
 When God is the Lord of your life, you delight in his people.

997
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,700
 When God is the Lord of your life, in summary,

998
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,420
 you find joy in his presence.

999
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,500
 When God is the Lord of your life,

1000
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,980
 you pursue eternal pleasures.

1001
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,580
 It's a magical season, man,

1002
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,020
 between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

1003
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,060
 It gets cold.

1004
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,540
 Christmas trees go up.

1005
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,880
 It's a pretty season.

1006
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,220
 A lot of things, there's just kind of a magic in the air.

1007
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,060
 You guys feel that?

1008
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,300
 I mean, am I the only one?

1009
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,060
 There's just kind of magic in the air.

1010
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,060
 There's also a lot of stress in the air.

1011
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,540
 It also gets kind of chaotic.

1012
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,820
 You guys feel that, a little chaos?

1013
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,900
 It gets a little crazy.

1014
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,100
 Travel plans, Christmas presents, Christmas parties,

1015
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,940
 full calendar, work done,

1016
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,300
 gotta finish the end of the year.

1017
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,940
 It gets just, I can't breathe, you know?

1018
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,780
 Just kind of crazy.

1019
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,580
 I just need to exhale a little bit, right?

1020
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,980
 And it's crazy that we forsake the reason for the season.

1021
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,260
 Like, this is crazy, man,

1022
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,180
 that we lose sight of the reason for the season.

1023
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,500
 But what I'm telling you tonight

1024
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,780
 is I think for so many of us,

1025
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,060
 we lose sight of the reason for our life.

1026
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,460
 Not just the reason, like Christmas

1027
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,860
 and what we've done with Christmas

1028
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,460
 that we've exchanged Christ's birthday.

1029
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
 Do you know that I was with

1030
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,180
 a bunch of kindergartners recently

1031
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,020
 and I asked them whose birthday was Christmas?

1032
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,700
 And do you know that some of them blurted out, Santa's.

1033
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:42,140
 And it's not, you know, like, it's kind of funny

1034
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,940
 and then you think about it and it's kind of really sad.

1035
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,700
 Like, if I was Satan and the whole world stopped

1036
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,940
 to celebrate the birth of God,

1037
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,380
 I would come up with this grand plan

1038
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,980
 with all my demons and my minions

1039
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,980
 to replace that celebration with consumerism and chaos.

1040
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,900
 And I'd put it in front of them

1041
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,380
 so that no one in the world

1042
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,620
 would actually think about the Christ

1043
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,820
 and wanna be near him.

1044
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,700
 They'd want stuff.

1045
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,380
 I would go after their adulterous hearts

1046
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,300
 and their materialistic ways

1047
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,980
 and I'd tempt them with sales and things

1048
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,980
 and stuff and status and presents and Santas.

1049
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:37,820
 What an awful plan.

1050
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,420
 And it's working.

1051
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:47,460
 And Christmas is just a micro example of our lives.

1052
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,780
 I'm not saying don't forget the reason for the season.

1053
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,380
 I'm saying don't forget the reason you're alive, man.

1054
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:01,380
 Young man, young woman, prince, princess.

1055
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:09,020
 Don't forget the reason your heart beats in your chest

1056
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,100
 and you have breath in your life.

1057
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,980
 I'm not asking you to go to church

1058
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,940
 or to read your Bible or to pray.

1059
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:24,140
 I'm asking you to go all in with Jesus 100%,

1060
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,100
 all in, everything,

1061
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,900
 that you would see people

1062
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,180
 as those you do ministry with

1063
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,460
 and those you do ministry to,

1064
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,580
 that you would pursue joy in his presence

1065
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,540
 and that you would hold out

1066
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,420
 for the promise of pleasures in eternity.

1067
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,260
 Let me pray that you would.

1068
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,020
 (pages rustling)

1069
00:43:48,020 --> 00:44:05,860
 God in heaven, thank you just for an opportunity

1070
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,220
 to preach from the Bible.

1071
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,900
 Lord, thank you for the way that you've protected us.

1072
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,540
 Thank you for what you're allowing us

1073
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,660
 to persevere in right now.

1074
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,860
 God, please don't let us get stuck in the trap of sin.

1075
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,220
 Father, please set us free

1076
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,660
 from the desires of our wicked heart,

1077
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,740
 the desires of our flesh,

1078
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,340
 the things that we wanna run after to instead of you.

1079
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,020
 God, please help us to prioritize

1080
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,420
 our calendar appropriately.

1081
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,300
 Please help us to stop idolizing friend groups

1082
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,220
 that are leading us to death over and over and over again.

1083
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,780
 Lord, please help us to stop going back to that computer

1084
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,900
 to looking at those images,

1085
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,220
 to spending money in those ways that we don't have,

1086
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,620
 to buying trinkets and treasures and pieces of worship.

1087
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,940
 Please help us to stop worshiping other gods

1088
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,220
 with our lips and what we say and what we sing

1089
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,820
 and where we go.

1090
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,500
 Lord, I pray that you would protect us,

1091
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,380
 that you would make our lot secure,

1092
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,300
 that we would see there are boundary lines

1093
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,140
 of fallen in pleasant places

1094
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,100
 because we see every place we are in light of your kingdom.

1095
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,820
 Would you help us do that?

1096
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:06,900
 And Father, in the chaos of this season,

1097
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,100
 help us not to look past the Christ.

1098
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,180
 That you sent a sacrifice,

1099
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,420
 a baby born to die

1100
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,620
 on our behalf

1101
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,900
 because of what we've done

1102
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,420
 so that we can be with you forever and ever and ever

1103
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,140
 and ever in your kingdom.

1104
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,860
 The other day I was sitting with,

1105
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,060
 it was after, it was last week after the porch,

1106
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,060
 David and some of our leaders came over to my house

1107
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,260
 and we were just sitting on the back porch

1108
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,540
 and talking and it's a good discussion

1109
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,740
 and the topic just came up and they just said,

1110
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,940
 "Hey, you ever think we ask too much of people?"

1111
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,940
 And I said, "What do you mean?"

1112
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,700
 And he's like, "No, just like with service and stuff here,

1113
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,700
 "it's like, you know, it just feels like

1114
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,860
 "we're asking a lot of them

1115
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,940
 "and aren't you afraid of burnout?"

1116
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,900
 And that sort of thing.

1117
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,260
 And I just said, "No, I don't think

1118
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,940
 "we're asking enough of people."

1119
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,340
 I said, "I really don't think we're asking enough of people."

1120
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,180
 Let's see, you know, Christ says,

1121
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,100
 "Take up your cross and follow me."

1122
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,820
 He says, "In me you'll find life."

1123
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,140
 He said, "Anyone who loses their life for my sake

1124
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,780
 "will find it."

1125
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:30,780
 And yeah, we're not trying to grow an audience.

1126
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,780
 We're trying to grow his army.

1127
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:37,260
 And thank God, I look back on the time I came to church

1128
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,020
 and I sat in the back row and I was hungover

1129
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,340
 and addicted to pornography, addicted to sex,

1130
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,660
 loving the party, loving Dallas,

1131
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,500
 loving everything that the world has to offer.

1132
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,060
 And I thank God that somebody called me

1133
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,580
 to go all in with him.

1134
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,260
 I had a hunch, like I had a sense

1135
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:58,300
 that I had some gifts that God could maybe use,

1136
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,740
 but I was so stuck on myself.

1137
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,500
 I was so stuck on my kingdom.

1138
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,820
 I couldn't see God past me.

1139
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,700
 And somebody just said,

1140
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,660
 "Hey, I'm not asking you to go to church on Sunday.

1141
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,420
 "I'm asking you to live a fully devoted follower,

1142
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,380
 "a life fully devoted to following Christ,

1143
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,500
 "24 hours a day, seven days a week,

1144
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,620
 "and everything you do, that every relationship you have,

1145
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,020
 "you would see in light of eternity.

1146
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,940
 "And everything you do, you would do

1147
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,820
 "through the lens of eternity, that full devotion."

1148
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,660
 They redefined Christianity for me.

1149
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,260
 I'm like, "Oh, I thought I was a Christian

1150
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,580
 "'cause I was born in a Christian home."

1151
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,220
 They're like, "No, Christians follow Jesus."

1152
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,500
 Cool.

1153
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,060
 That's what we wanna help you do.
