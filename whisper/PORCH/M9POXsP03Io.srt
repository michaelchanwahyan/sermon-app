00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [music]

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Well, welcome to the porch. How we doing tonight? Let's go. Hey, my name is Josiah Jones. I have the privilege of serving here on staff.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I want to give a shout out to all of our Porch Live locations. Porch Live Dayton, Ohio; Midland, Texas; ATL, we see you; Porch Atlanta. Give them up.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 [applause]

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 And then right here in this room, Dallas, Texas. We're so glad you're here. It's starting to feel like fall here in Texas.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Dallas Pacific, come on. That's exciting. Texas Rangers are in the World Series.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 [applause]

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Let's go. And you're here. Halloween night, you're here. Hey, this is one of my favorite times of the year, Halloween.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Let me put a picture of my family up on the screen. Let me show you. Okay, here we go. These are my three kids.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 We got Camille, who's my oldest. She's Anastasia. And then my boy Caleb. He's Corey Seeger. Yeah, you know. That's right. That's right.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And then we have Isabella, and she's Ariel. And so that's my crew, and we love Halloween.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I'm not with them, but my wife texted me that earlier, and so I just thought I'd introduce my fam. Haven't done that in a while.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Well, hey, we're diving into John chapter 13. So if you have your Bibles, you can open it to John chapter 13.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 This is going to be a familiar passage for some of you. This is the passage -- we're pulling up on the passage where Jesus washes the disciples' feet.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 We've been in a series titled "Glory, Beholding Jesus Through the Book of John."

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And we're coming back to a familiar passage, like I said, and I'm excited. I'm excited because of what God's going to do tonight.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 But before we get going, let me just start out by asking a question.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 If you knew that you were going to die in 18 hours, what would you do? Like, if you knew you were going to die in 18 hours, what would you do?

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 It's not rhetorical. Let's just talk. Travel. Okay. 18 hours. She said she'd travel.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Okay. I love it. Visit your family.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 What is it? Buy a cat?

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 What'd she say? I don't bless that. Cats are from hell. Dogs are from heaven.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I just offended you. I'm sorry. That's not true. I'm playing. What else would you do? 18 hours. What would you do?

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Get married, she says. Fellas.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 What? Keep fighting for survival. Okay.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 More specifically, if you had 18 hours to live, what would you do and who would you gather?

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Like, who would you gather and maybe what would you tell them?

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And so the reason why I'm proposing this question to you tonight is because this is the scene in John chapter 13.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 In John chapter 13, Jesus is having his final meal with his 12 disciples because he has 18 hours from this scene to live.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And he would go on to die on a cross for the forgiveness of sins.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Jesus is gathering his closest man, his closest boys, his 12 disciples, and he is about to tell them something very simple but profound.

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 He's about to give his final message before he dies. Jesus is setting them up for the rest of their lives and he's giving them a message.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Why? Because in a few hours he would be betrayed by one of his disciples himself, Judas.

34
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 In a few hours he would be betrayed by all of his earthly friends.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 They would scatter and run away.

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 In a few hours he would enter six different trials where he would be beaten, bloodied, and bruised beyond recognition.

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And if that wasn't enough, he would carry all of our sins on his shoulders.

38
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And he's gathering his closest men, his closest boys, his disciples, and he's going to tell them something in John 13.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Here we go. John 13, starting in verse 1.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Now before the feast of the Passover, so think this is holiday season, what we're about to come up on, Christmas and Thanksgiving.

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Holidays are normally a joyful occasion where you gather with your family, you have some time off work, and you break bread.

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 You share a meal.

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 This is the scene that Jesus is having with his disciples.

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And so now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father,

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the very end.

46
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 He loved them to the very end. That's important. Circle that.

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 During supper, when the devil had already been put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Judas at this point had already made a pact with Satan to betray Jesus,

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 to fulfill the ancient prophecy in the Old Testament in Zechariah 11, that he would betray him for 30 pieces of silver.

50
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That's just like a few hundred bucks.

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Each of us need to ask ourselves the question, what am I tempted to exchange my relationship with Jesus for?

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Sex? Fame? Money? Climbing the corporate ladder?

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Influence? Autonomy? Independence? Comfort?

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Like, why am I asking you that question? Why am I saying, hey, this is a question that we should propose to ourselves?

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Because if we don't know the answer to that question, then we don't know how Satan is going to try to tempt us.

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Like, we need to have a death grip on this answer. For me, it's pride.

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Where sometimes I can wake up and say, God, I got this. I don't need you.

58
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But other times it's lust. I mean, some of you know my story. I was a porn addict for almost a decade of my life.

59
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 The other thing that I know Satan will try to tempt me with his anger, when my expectations don't get met,

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 when things seem out of control in my life, when I am grasping for control, I can just explode with the best of them.

61
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 What is it for you? What are you tempted to exchange for your relationship with Jesus?

62
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Because Satan will try to tempt you with that. And you and I, we need to be able to live in the light with trusted brothers.

63
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 If you're a guy in the room, you need some men in your life to make war with.

64
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 If you're a lady in the room, you need some women that you can make war with. We call that community group here at Watermark.

65
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 That we would be in community with like-minded people, people that will help us fight against our sin,

66
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 against Satan and what the world throws at us.

67
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 For Judas, it was a few hundred bucks. What is it for you?

68
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 He goes on in verse 3, "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands,

69
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 and that he had come from God and was going back to God."

70
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Now we just see that this Jesus is authority, like he's just flexing on them.

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Like I've come from God and I'm going to go back to God.

72
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 "He rose from supper," verse 4, "he laid aside his outer garments and taking a towel, he tied it around his waist."

73
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Verse 5, "Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet

74
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him."

75
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 You see, Jesus chose these 12 disciples, including Judas, which begs the question,

76
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 if Jesus is omniscient, he's all-knowing, then why would he choose someone that would ultimately betray him

77
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 to show you and I that he's not just loving people that love him.

78
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 He's not just loving people that meet all of his expectations,

79
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 but he's loving people that would do some of the lowest things that you could do.

80
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I mean, some of you, you get this. Like when you hear the word "betray," you're like, "Yeah, man, I've been there."

81
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 I had a parent that betrayed me. I had a best friend that betrayed me.

82
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I had a boyfriend, a significant other that betrayed me.

83
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And you get that. That resonates with you.

84
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And here we see Jesus washing the feet of his disciples,

85
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 which he's fully aware of the fact that one was actively planning to betray.

86
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And on top of that, he knew the hearts of all of them. He knew that Thomas would doubt him.

87
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 He knew that Peter would deny him three times.

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And he didn't just wash the disciples' feet that was easy to wash.

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 He washed the ones even, knowing what they would do.

90
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 It reminds me of the verse in Romans 5 where it just says that Jesus died for us while we were yet sinners.

91
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Like he knew everything that we would do past, present, and future.

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And he still went to the cross. He still had you in mind, knowing everything you would ever do.

93
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And he still went. He still washed the feet. He still loved his disciples.

94
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Jesus didn't let this distract him nor discriminate against Judas.

95
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 There's real racism, even in this room.

96
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Discrimination. You have that in your heart because of maybe what someone has done to you.

97
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And Jesus says, I'm not going to let that distract me.

98
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 I'm not going to let that discriminate. I'm not going to discriminate against Judas.

99
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I'm going to pursue him even when it's hard.

100
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Because he was on a mission. What was his mission?

101
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 His mission was to seek and save that which was lost.

102
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 His mission was to show the world that if this world is going to change, it's going to be changed through love.

103
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 A ferocious love.

104
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And he put that on display on the cross of Jesus Christ.

105
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Like you also see that his mission is not going to be altered because someone else sins against him.

106
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Like some of us, man, we're just like, oh, that person, you know, I'm out.

107
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Or it's just like, hey, I put my stock in that pastor or that church and they let me down.

108
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And I get it, man, that's painful.

109
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 But you start putting your stock in a person, even people that stand on this stage,

110
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 man, we're going to let you down.

111
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And we pray by God's grace that we don't do anything stupid,

112
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 that we continue to run the course that God has laid out before us.

113
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 But we don't look to people, ultimately we look to the one who's perfect, and that's Jesus.

114
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Amen.

115
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And that's what he has in mind.

116
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 He's fixated on what God the Father has called him to do.

117
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And he's loving his disciples even to the very end.

118
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And one of the couple things we can learn from this story through the life of Judas is this,

119
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 is your heart hard towards Jesus.

120
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Let me ask you, was Jesus a good friend to Judas?

121
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Yes.

122
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Did Jesus serve Judas?

123
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Yes.

124
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Did Jesus love Judas?

125
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Yes.

126
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Was Judas there when Jesus preached his sermons?

127
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Yes.

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Was he there when he did his miracles?

129
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Yes.

130
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Judas had a privileged seat in all of history to watch Jesus do the things that so many of you would say,

131
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 "Hey, I don't love Jesus, I don't believe in Jesus,

132
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 but if I had a seat to watch Jesus do the miracles that he did 2,000 years ago,

133
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 if I could see Jesus, then I would believe him."

134
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And I'm telling you right now, if you have a hard heart, no, you wouldn't.

135
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 That's Judas.

136
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 His heart is hard.

137
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 He's already made a pact with Satan.

138
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 No one had a better seat to learn from Jesus than Judas.

139
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 He had seen some great things.

140
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 He's seen Jesus turn water into wine.

141
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 He's seen Jesus feed thousands with the little kid's lunchbox.

142
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 He saw Jesus water ski without a boat.

143
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 He walked on water.

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 He saw Jesus heal people without a deductible or a copay, free health care.

145
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Like, that's what -- this is Judas.

146
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 He's got a front-row seat to watch the King of kings and the Lord of lords do the unthinkable.

147
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And he's ultimately going to betray Jesus and hand him over to be executed and murdered,

148
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 and then he goes, hangs himself in a field and dies and goes to hell.

149
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And I think we just have this mentality sometimes that, well, they're just in a better place.

150
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Maybe.

151
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Did they love Jesus?

152
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Did they truly follow Jesus?

153
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 I mean, Jesus spoke about hell twice as much as he spoke about heaven.

154
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And so for some of us, we need to understand that for those of us that know and love Jesus,

155
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 this life is the closest thing to hell that you will ever experience.

156
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But those of us that don't know and love Jesus, this is the closest heaven you will ever experience.

157
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And that's tragic.

158
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Because I know the pain that's associated in this room.

159
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Last time I spoke up here, I talked about pain and suffering and why God allows that to happen.

160
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 And I believe that God is ultimately going to come back.

161
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I've read the rest of the book, Revelation 20, and he's going to wipe away every tear from our eye.

162
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Death will be no more.

163
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 There will be no more pain or sorrow.

164
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 The former things will pass away.

165
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Behold, he's going to make all things new.

166
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And that's what we have to hold on to in the midst of pain and suffering.

167
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Number two, good Bible teaching is not enough.

168
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 You have to believe it.

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Judas for three years was taught by Jesus Christ and he didn't believe any of it.

170
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And one of the reasons I love the porch, one of the things I love to do the most throughout my entire week

171
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 is because I get to show up here and sit underneath one of the best Bible teachers in all of America, I believe.

172
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I'm not saying that to puff TA, Timothea Tika, but I'm just saying, man, he's an amazing Bible teacher.

173
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But let me remind you what James 1.22 says.

174
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves.

175
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 See, we can get the word of God into you, but you got to make sure that the word of God gets into you.

176
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Judas' problem was not information, it was application.

177
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 See, some of us think that, oh, if I just get enough information, it's going to transform my life.

178
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 No, it won't.

179
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Information doesn't equal transformation.

180
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Information plus application equals transformation.

181
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 What Judas was missing, what my life was missing for 22 years, what some of your lives are missing is application.

182
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 There's no shortage of information.

183
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 You can show up on Sunday, Tuesday, podcast, get the latest books.

184
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Some of us, we fail to do what James 2 says.

185
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Don't just be a hearer of the word, but be a doer of the word.

186
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Faith without works is dead.

187
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 You're not saved for your work or from your work.

188
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 You're saved by God's grace.

189
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 You don't work for your salvation, but you do work from it.

190
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Now that you are saved, you in response work from your salvation.

191
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And here's the reality as we study this passage.

192
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 You and I are prone to the same thing.

193
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 When we look at this story, we have to ask ourselves, am I Jesus or Judas?

194
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And as you read the Bible, many times you read it and you know when Jesus is teaching, you're usually the people he's teaching about.

195
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 If you're reading the Bible and be like, yep, there's Jesus again, that looks like me.

196
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You're reading it wrong.

197
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I mean, that's just the reality.

198
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And so our heart is prone to do what Judas did.

199
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Our heart is prone to fall into the same trap that Judas fell into.

200
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Number three, you can't lose your salvation, but you can fake it.

201
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 You can't lose your salvation, but you can fake it.

202
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 This was Judas' problem.

203
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Like there's a debate in the church, did Judas lose his salvation?

204
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 No, he faked it.

205
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 He was never saved to begin with.

206
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Judas went to church.

207
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 You're in church.

208
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Judas learned the Bible.

209
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You've learned some of the Bible.

210
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Judas was in relationship with godly people.

211
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Maybe you're here and in relationship with godly people.

212
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And listen, my job isn't to judge you tonight, but Paul says in 2 Corinthians 13, to judge yourselves.

213
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 So tonight I give you the gavel.

214
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Where do you stand?

215
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Ask yourself, do you love Jesus Christ?

216
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Or are you faking it?

217
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Judas faked it for three years, and Jesus still pursued him and loved him.

218
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I faked it for 13 years of my life.

219
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Like this was my story.

220
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I came to Christ, or I said the sinner's prayer at 8.

221
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 At the end of my mom's bed, it was nothing more than fire insurance, parents' divorce, never got plugged back into church,

222
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 and went off to college, and my life was a train wreck.

223
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I mean, not literally.

224
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 I mean, people would say, oh, Josiah's got everything.

225
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Some of you have heard my story.

226
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 I share it often.

227
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And I was playing college baseball and thinking that I had everything at my fingertips.

228
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 But it left me empty and unfulfilled.

229
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And so I had a Bible because that's just what religious people do.

230
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 You usually have a Bible, and sometimes you might even go to church.

231
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I went to church at times.

232
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I wore that cross necklace around my neck, but my life looked no different than the rest of the world.

233
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 I was hiding behind two-dimensional images, behind my computer, and sexual immorality with multiple women and partying.

234
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 You know it.

235
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 You know that lifestyle, some of you.

236
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 And I remember opening the Bible to 2 Corinthians 13:5, and in 2 Corinthians 13:5, Paul is going to the church in Corinth,

237
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 and he just says, hey, I'm not going to affirm whether you're saved or not.

238
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 That's not my job.

239
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I'm not going to say, hey, do you remember that time when you walked the aisle or you committed your life to, you know, church camp?

240
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 He doesn't do any of that.

241
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 He just says examine your life and test your faith against what the Word of God says and see if your faith is truly genuine.

242
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And I was like, whoa.

243
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 When I started testing my life against this book, I was like, man, there's no way I'm saved.

244
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I John 3 says when you live in continuous sin, it shows that you belong to the devil who has been sinning since the beginning.

245
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 But the Son of God, Jesus, came to destroy the works of the devil, and those who have been born into God's family do not make a practice of sinning because God is in them.

246
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And listen, he's not saying that you're never going to sin.

247
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 He says, you're not going to make a practice of sinning and never experience any life change.

248
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And I looked back on my life for 13 years, and there was little to no life change.

249
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And so, man, all I knew was like, man, I'm broken.

250
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 My mouth has stopped of all justification.

251
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I need Jesus.

252
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And I knew what that word practice meant.

253
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 I did it every day on the baseball field.

254
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Doing the same thing over and over and over and over until you master it.

255
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I was really good at sin.

256
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Really good at sinning.

257
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And so I faked it.

258
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Do you believe in the Jesus who lives or the Jesus who lived?

259
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 The Jesus who lived 2,000 years ago, died on a cross and rose again on the third day to defeat sin and death, and now he's the poster child for Christianity, and now you subscribe to him.

260
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 But your life has little to no bearing.

261
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Your life doesn't really reflect him.

262
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Or do you believe in the Jesus who lives?

263
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 That Jesus died on the cross for your sins, rose again, sits at the right hand of the father, he rules and reigns over everything and even your life.

264
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And you give him allegiance to the broken areas of your life.

265
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Like when you in the Bible disagree who wins, it's one of my favorite questions to ask.

266
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Do you submit to the things of God?

267
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 I'm not talking about perfection.

268
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 No one's perfect.

269
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 No, not one.

270
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 But I am talking about a desire, an oomph, a passion, a calling to be God's man, to be God's woman.

271
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Verse 6...

272
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Jesus answered, what I am doing, Peter, you're not going to understand now.

273
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 But afterwards you will understand.

274
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Peter said to him, you shall never wash my feet.

275
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Peter was just like, no, no, Jesus, this is not what you -- you're like the king of kings.

276
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 That's not what you do, Jesus.

277
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 See, for some of you, Jesus comes to serve you but you're too proud to be served.

278
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And you think you're humble because you serve others.

279
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Humility is not just serving, it's also being humble enough to let other people serve you and ultimately in this context let Jesus serve you.

280
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 How does Jesus serve you?

281
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Have you recognized that you're a sinner separated from him, you need saving?

282
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Have you recognized that?

283
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Have you seen your need for Jesus?

284
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 So Jesus answered him, okay, Peter, if you don't want me to wash your feet, if I do not wash you, you have no share with me.

285
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Jesus is like, okay, I can wash your feet or you can go to hell.

286
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 You know, like I just love like the bluntness of Jesus.

287
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 You know, that's a paraphrased version, right.

288
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 But that's just Jesus.

289
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Like plan A, Jesus I wash you and forgive you of your sin.

290
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Or plan B, it won't end well for you.

291
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Which one you want.

292
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Look at Peter's response...

293
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 So here's Peter speaking up and says, Jesus, you're going to wash my feet.

294
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Then Jesus makes a declaration which is an explanation to the simple gospel that unless I wash you then, you have no part with me.

295
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 This foot washing is more than a physical act here.

296
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 It is a painting a spiritual picture of what Jesus has done for every single one of us.

297
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 The simple gospel is explained here.

298
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Just like Jesus is washing the disciples' feet, Jesus would shed his blood to wash our sin.

299
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 The only way that we would come into a relationship with God is through the cross which washes away our sin.

300
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 The only way that we can come into a relationship with the eternal God is when we say, God, I need you.

301
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 God, I can't, but you can.

302
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 There's nothing I can do to get to be made right with you.

303
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 It's only through your death and your victory over the tomb when you rose from the dead snatching the keys to life and death.

304
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Like this is what he's saying.

305
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Like you can't wash yourself with good works.

306
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 You can't wash yourself with religiosity.

307
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 You can't wash yourself with, well, I hope my bad outweighs my good with charitable acts.

308
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Ephesians 2.8 and 9 says it clear, you have been saved by grace through faith not of yourself.

309
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 It's a gift from God so no man may boast.

310
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 If you could get to heaven based on what you do, what was the point of Jesus?

311
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Dying on the cross.

312
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Last week I was up in Cleveland, Ohio, out of all places, teaching and doing a young adult conference.

313
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Taught on Sunday morning and was with one of our guys on staff, Noah, our graphic designer.

314
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 And so what do we do as Texas boys?

315
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 We find a little bit of Texas in Cleveland.

316
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 We go to Texas Roadhouse.

317
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Right?

318
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Anybody?

319
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I get it.

320
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 We live in Dallas.

321
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Some of you are too bougie for Texas Roadhouse.

322
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 It's okay.

323
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Not me.

324
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 I like a good steak that's at a reasonable price.

325
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And so we go to Texas Roadhouse.

326
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And we're talking to our waiter, D., and we're having a great conversation with him.

327
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 He's a young adult and he's doing a great job.

328
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 And so we're just getting to know him and what he's doing.

329
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And I just turned to D.

330
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And I just said, "D., I'm curious.

331
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Do you have a faith?"

332
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 He said, "No, man, not really.

333
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I mean, I kind of heard a little bit about Jesus growing up.

334
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 But then, you know, just kind of fell away."

335
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And I said, "Okay.

336
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 No big deal."

337
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 I said, "D., you believe that you're a sinner?

338
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 You don't think you're perfect?"

339
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 "No, man, I'm far from perfect.

340
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And I don't need to know everything.

341
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 But I believe that too.

342
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 I'm far from perfect.

343
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And this is what God's done in my life."

344
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And I just said, "D., if you don't allow God to wash you from your sin,

345
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 then whose sin is -- then what are you going to do with your sin?"

346
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I said.

347
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Like who is your sin on, to be more specific?

348
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 He pauses for a second.

349
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 He thinks.

350
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And he says, "Me."

351
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And I said, "That's right."

352
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I said, "Does that concern you?"

353
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 He said, "Yeah, it kind of actually does."

354
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 I said, "Well, I'm preaching tomorrow at Sunday service.

355
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I'd love for you to come."

356
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 No, I didn't -- I mean, I invited him.

357
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 But we had a great conversation.

358
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And I was just talking to him.

359
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And I just said, "D., you can either ask God to wash you from your sin

360
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 or your sin can stay on you.

361
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Either your sin is going to be on Jesus or it's going to be on you.

362
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Which one do you want your sin to be on?"

363
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And the same is true for everyone in this room.

364
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Your sin will either be on you or it will be on Jesus.

365
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Who are you trusting tonight to wash your sin?

366
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 I love what A.W. Tozer says.

367
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 He says, "The only sin Jesus ever had was ours.

368
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And the only righteousness we can ever have is his."

369
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Gosh.

370
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Let me just read that one more time.

371
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 "The only sin Jesus ever had was ours."

372
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 It means he's perfect, thought, word, and action.

373
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 "And the only righteousness we can ever have is his."

374
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Where are you going to go to be made right with an eternal God?

375
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 One commentary says, "The fact that this is in the Bible, John 13,

376
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Jesus stooping down to wash feet, says that this book was not written by man

377
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 because men don't think this way."

378
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 There's enough evidence just in this story that this book wasn't written by man.

379
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 We don't think this way.

380
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Verse 12, "When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments

381
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 and resumed his place, he said to them,

382
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 'Do you understand what I have done?

383
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 You call me teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.

384
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 If then your Lord and teacher have washed your feet,

385
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 you also shall wash one another's feet.

386
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 For I have given you an example that also you should do

387
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 as I have done to you.'"

388
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 So as a response to this message,

389
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 we're going to give you an opportunity tonight to get your feet washed.

390
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And some of you are like, "What? I'm playing."

391
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Take a deep breath. Just kidding, okay?

392
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Some of you are so uncomfortable that you start looking for the exits.

393
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 No, that's not what we're going to do.

394
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 But think about it for a second.

395
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Like, this is crazy.

396
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Like, what if that was the response?

397
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 You'd be like, "I'm out, bro.

398
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 I'm heading to get food a lot earlier than I thought."

399
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 But seriously, take some thought to this.

400
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Why would you even have that?

401
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Because it's uncomfortable.

402
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 It's hard.

403
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 It takes a great deal of humility because you recognize that you're needy.

404
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And I believe Jesus is giving us this language figuratively,

405
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 not necessarily so that we wash each other's feet.

406
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 But can you imagine the intensity of this scene

407
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 as they're seeing their Lord, their teacher,

408
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 the guy that they revere?

409
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 He stoops down, gets on the floor, washes their feet,

410
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 done what would only be expected by the most lowly servant in that house.

411
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 And so he's having the last supper, his last meal with his boys.

412
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And in that culture, it was normalized to wash your feet before the meal.

413
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 But no one had washed their feet.

414
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Why?

415
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Because nobody in that room, at that table,

416
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 they didn't have the mindset,

417
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 they didn't have the humility to say, "You know what?

418
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 I'll do that.

419
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I'm not above that.

420
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Where's the water?

421
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Where's the basin?

422
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Let's go.

423
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Where's the towel?"

424
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 None of them did.

425
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And so they're sitting at a meal that most of the time in that culture,

426
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 you would not eat until your feet were washed,

427
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 and none of them had their feet washed

428
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 because every single one of the disciples said,

429
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 "I'm not going that low.

430
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I'm not going to the lowest servant in the house.

431
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I'm not doing that."

432
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And we all have that mentality, right,

433
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 as we do life and our culture here in Dallas?

434
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Like, what's the threshold for you?

435
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 I'm not going to do that.

436
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 I'm above that.

437
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 I'm beneath that.

438
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 What is it for you?

439
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And Jesus is trying to show us what greatness really is.

440
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 He's trying to redefine greatness with a towel and a basin.

441
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Think about one way that you could serve over the next 24 hours.

442
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Think through how can I do what Jesus has done.

443
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And obviously it's not just a one-time thing.

444
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 It's not just a 24-hour thing.

445
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 It's a lifestyle.

446
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 But to stoop and serve in a way that would be surprising

447
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 and even shocking to a culture of Dallas.

448
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Several years ago, some students at Moody Bible Institute

449
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 in Chicago, Illinois, just got together and said,

450
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 "How can we put God's love on display in this city?"

451
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And so one of them piped up and they just said,

452
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 "Hey, what if we set up a free water station

453
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 and a foot massage station at the Gay Olympics?"

454
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 No lie.

455
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 And so they rented out a booth.

456
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And they set up a foot-washing station,

457
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 kind of a massage station, a free water station

458
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 at the Gay Olympics.

459
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And people had been walking for miles that day

460
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 and they were hot and they were sweaty

461
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 and they'd been on their feet for hours.

462
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And one by one, people started to come.

463
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And one by one, they got out their supplies

464
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 and they began to clean the feet and massage the feet

465
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 and give out waters.

466
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 And people started asking, "Why are you doing this?"

467
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 And they said, "Well, we follow Jesus."

468
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And we read a story in the Bible

469
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 where Jesus did something very similar.

470
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 And they began to share the gospel

471
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 with people in a way that was unarming,

472
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 not intimidating.

473
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 And about 100 yards down the road,

474
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 there was another group of so-called Christians.

475
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 And they had these signs that said, "Turn or burn."

476
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 "Turn or go to hell."

477
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Now, which one you think had more influence?

478
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Which message do you think landed better?

479
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 I mean, I think we all know that it was the first one.

480
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 But this is what God is saying.

481
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Would we do something with...

482
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 What is your threshold to serve the people around you?

483
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 God is trying to get us to think about

484
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 how to put His love on display in a tangible way

485
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 in a way that is totally contrary

486
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 to the culture that day.

487
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 What would that be here in Dallas?

488
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Great question to ask ourselves is this.

489
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 Whenever I see a need that I can meet,

490
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 I try to ask myself,

491
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 "God, is this a need that you want me to meet?"

492
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Like, what if a couple thousand people in this room,

493
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 whenever you saw a need,

494
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 you just stopped and you asked,

495
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 "God, is this a need you want me to meet?"

496
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 This would slow you down.

497
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 It would cause you to pause instead of moving on.

498
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 I don't know if God's going to call you to meet every need,

499
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 but what if we just paused long enough to say,

500
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 "God, would you give me eyes to see needs?

501
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Would you give me a heart that would be wrapped around

502
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 the needs here in Dallas?

503
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 God, would you give me hands that would be readily available

504
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 to serve the needs of this city?"

505
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 I think God would use your life in a way

506
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 that you've never seen Him use your life before,

507
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 to put God's love on display in a tangible way

508
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 so others can come to know Him.

509
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 God is showing us that He defines greatness

510
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 through a towel and a basin.

511
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Life is not found in how much you can get.

512
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Life is found in how much you can give.

513
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And listen, we selflessly serve

514
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 because Jesus has selflessly served us.

515
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 Serving doesn't wash you.

516
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 You serve because you have been washed.

517
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And ultimately, He's giving us a picture

518
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 of a deep love He's had for disciples

519
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 who are all across the board.

520
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 And He's saying, "I've loved you to the very end of the age,

521
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 and I'm going to show you how you can love

522
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 to the very end of your age.

523
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Whenever your time is, whenever your expiration date is,

524
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 this is how you are going to flip the world upside down.

525
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 This is how the world is going to change.

526
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 This is how the church is going to be birthed

527
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 when you understand this type of love."

528
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 I believe that Jesus didn't come to give away titles,

529
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 but He came to give away towels.

530
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Greatness is found in serving.

531
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 I want you to help me welcome a really good friend of mine,

532
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 a guy that is in my community group

533
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 or in my extended community group, I would say,

534
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 a guy that I've invested in,

535
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 a guy that has probably invested in me a lot more.

536
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 His name is Kyle Sullivan.

537
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Would you help me welcome Kyle Sullivan to the stage?

538
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 [applause]

539
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 And I know some of you are gasping right now

540
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 because you're like,

541
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 "Is he really going to wash his brother's feet?"

542
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Yes.

543
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Kyle is a guy who I met.

544
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 He was one of the first guys I met in the summer of 2019

545
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 when I came to the porch.

546
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 And Kyle is one of those guys that I just related to quickly.

547
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 He was a guy that had been chasing everything

548
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 underneath the sun.

549
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 This past summer, we went through the book of Ecclesiastes,

550
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 and we studied about a guy named Solomon

551
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 who was just chasing one thing after the next.

552
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 And this was Kyle's story.

553
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 He played football at SMU and, you know,

554
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 had a lot of influence and prestige and stature,

555
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 but quickly realized that greatness is not found

556
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 in how much he could get.

557
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Greatness is found in how much he could give.

558
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 And I was just intrigued in seeing this brother

559
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 serving the Lord here at the porch,

560
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 a guy who many would say,

561
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 "Oh, man, don't waste your time for three hours at the porch serving.

562
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Man, there's a lot of other ways you can give back

563
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 or spend your time."

564
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 And when I think about this story,

565
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 I think about what Jesus came to do as he allowed his love

566
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 to drive him to a place where he would do the unthinkable.

567
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Like, nobody wanted this role.

568
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Nobody.

569
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Because this role was dirty, it was filthy.

570
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 In that context, it was an agricultural society.

571
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Like, people would walk around in sandals.

572
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 They didn't have Nike Air Max or Adidas Cloud Foams.

573
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Like, they didn't have that, right?

574
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 And so they would just walk on dirt and mud and, you know,

575
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 I'm not going to get too graphic here,

576
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 but, you know, the animals would poop

577
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 and they would just walk all over those things.

578
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 And their feet would be absolutely filthy.

579
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 And Jesus is trying to paint a picture.

580
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 I don't think that's what cows' feet are.

581
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Those his feet look kind of pedicured tonight, right?

582
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 But Jesus is trying to paint a picture

583
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 and he doesn't care if it's uncomfortable.

584
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 I bet it's uncomfortable to the disciples

585
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 and I bet it's uncomfortable to Kyle.

586
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 [laughter]

587
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 But he is trying to paint a picture

588
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 and I'm trying to paint a picture that has been preserved

589
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 for over 2,000 years in this book.

590
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 And I believe that God is trying to etch,

591
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 to brand this picture in our heart and in our soul tonight.

592
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 That greatness is found

593
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 when we get on our knees metaphorically and we serve.

594
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 Because I believe in a culture like Dallas

595
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 that fights for the next title,

596
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 that fights for the next promotion,

597
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 that fights for the next Instagram following,

598
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 that fights for the next raise

599
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 and that marks their greatness on a bank account

600
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 or what zip code they live in or what car they drive.

601
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 God is trying to flip this on its head tonight

602
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 and get us to see that true greatness is found when we serve.

603
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 And so tonight, Kyle,

604
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 thank you for letting me have the privilege

605
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 to serve your feet.

606
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 To wash your feet, brother.

607
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 And so I think this water's warm.

608
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 I think it is, man.

609
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Anna did a great job of making sure

610
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 we're not shocking your feet up here.

611
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Come on.

612
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 And again, in this day,

613
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 it's not like what I'm getting to wash.

614
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 It's the lowest of lows.

615
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 And I just think that sometimes when we think about serving,

616
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 we're like, man, maybe I need to capture this real quick.

617
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 You know?

618
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Hashtag changing the world.

619
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 Let me get one more.

620
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Oh, I need to zoom out.

621
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Hashtag changing the world.

622
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Here we go.

623
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 Hashtag serving my city.

624
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 And a lot of times, man,

625
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 our motives are all wrong when it comes to serving.

626
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 And Jesus was trying to show us, man,

627
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 that serving should happen with no one really knowing about it.

628
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 That if we're going to have the right heart,

629
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 that if we're going to have the right motives,

630
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 we're going to serve no matter if we get any type of praise.

631
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 We're going to serve in a way that allows people to see God's glory,

632
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 not our glory.

633
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 And so when you go to serve,

634
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 you don't have to have someone capture every moment and throw up that hashtag.

635
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 You get to serve freely because of the selfless act that Christ has done for you.

636
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 And so this is a picture, not a very good one.

637
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 I mean, Jesus had a better one.

638
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 But I'm here just trying to show you that, yeah, this might be uncomfortable.

639
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 This might be weird.

640
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 This might even be cringe for some of you.

641
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Like, what are you doing, bro?

642
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 But I don't care because that's the point.

643
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 Jesus is saying, hey, it's not always going to be comfortable.

644
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 It's not always going to be what you want it to be.

645
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 It's going to be hard.

646
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 It's going to be painful at times.

647
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 It's going to require sacrifice.

648
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 So, Kyle, I love you.

649
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 I appreciate you.

650
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Did we not have a dry cloth for you?

651
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Oh, man, he's going to be dropping soaky wet feet off the stage, man.

652
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 Y'all give it up for Kyle.

653
00:42:48,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 [Applause]

654
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Jesus washing his disciples' feet is a symbol of serving.

655
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 It's a symbol of -- that he would say, hey, if you -- if I do this for you,

656
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 you go do this for others.

657
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 Then Jesus would go to the next disciple and the next disciple and the next

658
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 disciple.

659
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 And one of the things I can't get over as I continue to read this passage,

660
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 like Kyle, man, he is a good friend, a trusted brother.

661
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 Like I trust this bro with my kids.

662
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 But then you see Jesus going to Judas and washing Judas' feet.

663
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 And let me just tell you, like if Kyle betrays me, I'm just saying, man,

664
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 the flesh in me is going to be like, I cut you off, bro.

665
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 Like that's just human nature, right.

666
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 But Jesus goes to Judas and he begins to wash Judas' feet.

667
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Like Judas was Jesus' financial advisor.

668
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 He sat at the honor of -- he sat at the most honored place at this last supper.

669
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 Like the person that's your financial advisor is the person you trust the

670
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 most.

671
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 They have your money.

672
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 Jesus gave Judas his best and Judas still betrayed Jesus.

673
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 And I can't imagine that fully, but I'm glad that I serve a king and a

674
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 Lord who still serves and pursues us even at our worst.

675
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 Because, again, we aren't Jesus in this passage.

676
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 We're Judas.

677
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 We're Peter.

678
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 Denying him.

679
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 We're Thomas who doubted.

680
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 And I'm just thankful that as I read this passage, I'm just overwhelmed by

681
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 God's goodness in my life that he would choose to still pursue me and love me

682
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 at my worst.

683
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 That's the whole purpose of the gospel.

684
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 That he didn't wait for you to clean your life up.

685
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 He came when you were at your worst.

686
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 And says, I got you.

687
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 I'll clean you up.

688
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And I think that this was in the mind of the disciples all those years after

689
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 as they would engage in lives marked by service.

690
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 Like church history would say that every disciple died for the cause of

691
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 Christ.

692
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 Like they gave their life up.

693
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 And they did it joyfully and they did it willingly and they did it openly and

694
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 they did it gladly.

695
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 And I think they remembered this scene where Jesus washed every single one of

696
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 their feet.

697
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 And he said, now you go and do the same.

698
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 And so if you're here tonight and you're like, man, I think I'm too far gone.

699
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 You're not.

700
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 Jesus is still pursuing you.

701
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 Jesus is still serving you.

702
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 Even if you have a heart to betray him.

703
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 To doubt him.

704
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 To deny him.

705
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 He says, I'm here.

706
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 What are you going to do with Jesus?

707
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 Your sin is either going to be on you or it's going to be on him.

708
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 Who are you trusting to wash you from your sin?

709
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 The other thing we see quickly is just what are you doing with your time

710
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 treasure talents?

711
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Do you know that almost 200 young adults give their life away every single week

712
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 to make the porch happen?

713
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 Like that's crazy.

714
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 Why?

715
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 Because they have a vision.

716
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 You can clap for that.

717
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 [Applause]

718
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 Yeah.

719
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 They have a vision of a preferred future that affects their present reality.

720
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 They realize that life is short.

721
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 That they have maybe five, ten years, maybe shorter in this young adult life

722
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 that God's given them to be able to maximize their days so that others

723
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 around them can come to know Christ.

724
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Maybe before they get married or they move or they enter into a different

725
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 season of life and they have kids or whatever the case may be.

726
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 And so how are you giving your life away weekly for the cause of Christ?

727
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 How are you giving your life away annually for the cause of Christ?

728
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 I know some of you right now, like you are, you're trying to figure out if you

729
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 can go halfway across the country to a place where no one has heard the gospel.

730
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 That would be an amazing thing to continue to pursue.

731
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 And we want to help you with that.

732
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 Like what if your life was marked by those two questions,

733
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 what am I doing weekly and annually so that people around me can come to know

734
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 the hope that lies within me?

735
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 Let me pray that they would tonight.

736
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 God in heaven, we need you.

737
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 We don't just leave from a message like this and pull our bootstraps up and

738
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 white knuckle this thing and think that we're going to be able to just do this

739
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 on our own, not a chance.

740
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 This only happens by your grace at work in our life.

741
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 And so as you've given us an incredible picture of how you have called us to

742
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 serve, how you have called us to give our life away through washing your

743
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 disciples' feet, and again, that's figuratively.

744
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 But God, would that picture, would it be etched in our heart tonight so that we

745
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 don't wake up tomorrow and live the same selfish lives that we've lived for the

746
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 past 20 years?

747
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 God, would you allow us to think that this life is about us?

748
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 God, would you allow us to see that when we give our life away, that's when life

749
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 is found?

750
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 Would you help us to think strategically about what it looks like to leverage my

751
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 time, leverage my talent, the gifts and abilities that you've given me, leverage

752
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 my treasure, the income that I have, the bank account that I have, it's all

753
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 yours, God, will we live lives that are open-handed to you tonight?

754
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 And would you help us to pursue the people around us and see needs in a way

755
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 that only you can see them?

756
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 Help us to walk closely with you, intimately with you.

757
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 Would we walk into every space and say, "God, is this a need you want me to

758
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 meet?"

759
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 God, please, I'm begging you to go before us tonight and do a work in us that we

760
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 can't do apart from you.

761
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

762
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 You're welcome.
