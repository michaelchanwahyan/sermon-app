[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.280]   Porch, how are we doing?
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.040]   We doing OK tonight?
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.480]   Great to see you.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.280]   Welcome back.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.200]   If you've been here before, if it's your very first time,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.800]   let me be one of hopefully very many people to just say,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.300]   welcome.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.300]   We're really glad that you're here at the Porch.
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.920]   Thanks for trusting us with your Tuesday.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.600]   Special shout out to everybody that's tuning in online.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.240]   We never want to lose sight of the fact
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.880]   that God is doing something great here,
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.640]   but he's doing something really great where you are also.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.560]   We're firm believers.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.840]   God can meet with anybody in any place at any time,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.380]   and that includes those of you that
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.120]   are tuning in with us tonight.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.580]   So thanks for being a part of this.
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.560]   Special shout out to Porch Live, Indy, Fresno, and Midland.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.160]   Well, Porch, our deconstructed series
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.080]   is coming to an official end.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.480]   We are rounding the corner--
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.240]   I know, that's how I feel.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.560]   We're rounding the corner into what
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.840]   I think is going to be a really important topic.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.200]   You see, our goal as we've stepped into this series
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.800]   is we've wanted to unpack the primary reasons that
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.920]   lead people to deconstruct from their faith.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.800]   And yet a series about deconstruction
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.360]   would not be complete if we didn't first
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.840]   talk about suffering.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.200]   So let me lead off with a story.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.120]   When I was in college ministry, I
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.480]   remember sitting down with one of the leaders who served
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.100]   in our weekly ministry because he
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.880]   needed to unpack a critical situation that he was facing.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.360]   You see, he was facing a plagiarism case
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.760]   in his senior year of college, which was a shock to me.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.360]   Like, this guy was the textbook example,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.160]   the model of what you hope would be true of your kids
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.880]   one day when they go to school.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.800]   Like, he was hardworking and smarter than most,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.920]   and he was loving the Lord and serving his people.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.120]   He was doing so many good things,
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.960]   which is why it blew me away to hear that he
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.440]   was in a situation where his integrity was being questioned,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.040]   where he may have, in fact, cheated on an assignment
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.560]   and used somebody else's work and claimed it as his own.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.400]   And so we sat down.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.880]   I looked, and I was like, dude, help me understand,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.840]   like, how are we even in this spot?
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.440]   And he goes, well, it's interesting,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.640]   because the person that I'm being accused of plagiarizing
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   is myself.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.760]   It's not anybody else's work.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.720]   It's work that I actually completed
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.760]   on a former assignment.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.360]   But because it isn't original to this assignment,
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.120]   it's a reference to something I already authored,
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.600]   I'm being taken to task.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   My professor is threatening me with potential expulsion.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.720]   And so as we process it together, I was like,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.600]   well, dude, you definitely gotta take a stand, right?
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.800]   Like, you can't just let this go unchecked.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.880]   Like, you need to make sure to defend your honor.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.400]   If you're not gonna do it, I'm gonna do it for you,
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   because this is crazy.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.440]   Like, it's your work.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.600]   It's not someone else's.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.520]   This is not my understanding of plagiarism.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.280]   And yet, as we began to process through it,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.760]   he told me, "Kylin, calm down.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.120]   "I'm in a little bit of a difficult spot
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.300]   "between a rock and a hard place,
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.440]   "because the situation I'm in is one where my professor
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.500]   "does not want me to call his reputation into question
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.360]   "by pushing the issue."
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.080]   So much so that he's actually threatening
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.160]   to call every medical school that I might, in fact,
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.760]   apply to and raise character concerns
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.120]   with their admission board.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.720]   That is being set between a rock and a hard place.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.760]   That is a difficult situation.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.720]   And so, as we began to process together what he would do,
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.960]   he looked at me and he asked me,
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.720]   "Kylin, why does stuff like this happen?
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.080]   "I've done everything right.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.120]   "Like, I've walked with God and I've worked hard
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.160]   "and I've served his people and I've invested in others
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.880]   "and I've made sure to utilize my gift and steward my time.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.200]   "Like, why is this happening to me?"
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.800]   What do you say to someone in a situation like that?
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.920]   When it feels like they've done everything
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.000]   and deserve to expect the best thing,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.440]   and yet their experience would say
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.640]   something different is happening altogether.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.360]   I remember in that same college ministry,
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.600]   I actually met a young lady
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.560]   who had no interest in Jesus whatsoever.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.280]   She was raised in a Muslim family,
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.600]   and yet she had a friend, not just any friend,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.800]   a best friend that fiercely loved God
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.760]   and was super intent on leading this young lady to Jesus.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.600]   And she did it.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.640]   Like, she relentlessly pursued this girl.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.480]   And in time, she came to place her faith in Christ.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.480]   And it wasn't just like, "I believe in Jesus."
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.120]   She believed in Jesus.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.840]   Like, she was ferocious in asking questions
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.360]   and learning as much as she could.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.920]   Like, it was early on within the first couple of weeks
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.160]   of her declaration of faith,
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.120]   where she looked at me and goes,
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.640]   "Can you explain the Trinity?"
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.880]   She was that in.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.120]   She was so into Christ.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.520]   And then her family found out.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.600]   And as her family found out,
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.200]   that which gave her so much life
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.800]   began to take life from her
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.480]   because the cost of her faith was that of her family.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.000]   They pushed her away.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.320]   They abandoned her entirely.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.160]   And I remember looking at her
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   as she was grieving the fact
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.920]   that this had all gone the way it was,
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.160]   where she was expecting the very best of things to happen,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.920]   yet the very worst of things had happened.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.840]   Yet the very worst of things had come.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.880]   And thinking the same question the guy before her
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.720]   had asked me, "Why does stuff happen like this?
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.260]   "I deserve to expect something,
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.680]   "but it feels like something different
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.680]   "has happened entirely."
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.400]   Or I remember, not in college ministry,
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.320]   but when I moved to Houston,
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.440]   I started working in young adult ministry.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.040]   I met this guy who actually came to Saving Faith
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.200]   in a room just like this.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.400]   Like, it was in a worship gathering
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.360]   where we preached on stage and we worshiped all together.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.160]   And he came down front and we were just talking.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.800]   And he decided, "Man, I'm gonna go all in on Jesus.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.040]   "I'm pushing my chips forward.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.940]   "I don't wanna be one foot in and one foot out.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.360]   "I want to be all in on Christ."
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.680]   And so we saw him.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.560]   Like, he drove two feet all the way
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.800]   into the deep end of the pool
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.320]   where he got implugged into the church.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.320]   He started serving on weekly basis.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.600]   He started serving within the outreach portion
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.920]   of his community group.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.120]   Like, he was a diehard fanatic in the faith.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.160]   And then the people that he thought were his friends
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.480]   actually betrayed him by talking about him
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.560]   when he was not in the room
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.560]   and using him at the cost of some sort of cheap joke.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.880]   They slandered him, they belittled him,
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.240]   they made fun of him when he wasn't around.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.080]   And he looked at me and said,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.340]   "Kylin, I thought that the church was supposed to be a place
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.780]   "where God's building a family.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.220]   "And yet this place feels like it's only filled with foes.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.540]   "Why is this happening?
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.800]   "This doesn't make sense.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.300]   "Like, I'm selecting into what should be
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.560]   "the best thing in life,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.820]   "and yet it feels like the worst thing is happening to me.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.760]   "Help me understand."
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.880]   What do you say to someone in a moment like that?
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.520]   When something genuinely, truly beautiful
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.900]   has happened in their life.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.280]   Like, they have placed their faith in Jesus.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.980]   They are walking with the Lord.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.920]   They are openly confessing their sin.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.240]   They are indulging the gift of community.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.740]   They're seeking God's purposes in the world.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.620]   And yet the very thing that we call beautiful for them
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.160]   is the very same thing that has cost them so dearly.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.020]   What do you say to someone like that?
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.000]   To someone seemingly lost medical school,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.680]   another that lost her family,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.200]   and the last lost any confidence
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.160]   that the people of God would actually be the people of God.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160]   Why does stuff like that happen?
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.200]   And why would anyone follow a God that lets it?
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.920]   That's the question we're staring down the barrel of tonight.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.600]   You see, that's a question that a lot of people,
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.640]   some of you in this room have asked yourself,
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.800]   and it's a question that a lot of people
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.060]   have actually answered that have led them to a place
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.960]   where they're no longer walking in the faith,
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.600]   they're actually walking away from the faith.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.680]   You see, we've heard it before.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.280]   Like, that age-old question, the problem of evil,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.120]   that God is either not good enough
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.920]   or he is either not powerful enough
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.760]   to solve the suffering in our world.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.440]   And yet, when it comes home
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.060]   and it actually roosts within our life,
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.000]   we know that question isn't so concerned
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.440]   with general suffering, but really personal suffering.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.000]   Like, some of you, you've seen some things,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.400]   you've heard some things, you've lived through some things
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.800]   where it's put you in a spot where you're looking at God
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.000]   and you can't really defend the guy.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.480]   Like, it doesn't make sense that if he is who he says he is,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.760]   that I would be living through the things
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.080]   that I'm actually living through.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.320]   Like, the Christian answers for the existence of evil
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.480]   and the tragedies of today
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.520]   and all the sufferings that surround,
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.820]   they just pale in comparison,
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.960]   they fall insufficient of what you actually need
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.060]   when suffering strikes.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.720]   If that's you, then tonight is for you.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.080]   And if you have a Bible,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.420]   we're gonna look at a passage in John chapter 16 together.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.560]   John chapter 16.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.120]   Tonight marks the official last talk
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.200]   in our series Deconstruction, or Deconstructed,
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.760]   where our aim has been to help you rebuild your reality,
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.360]   kind of boost your belief
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.260]   whenever it feels like crisis strikes,
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.220]   whenever you're wrestling with spiritual insecurity.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.640]   Because contrary to popular belief,
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.680]   we believe that you can actually question the faith
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.320]   without walking away from it,
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.320]   since there are better answers than cultural conformity
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.100]   or blind belief for following Jesus.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.760]   Paul David Tripp, he said this when he was interviewed
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.800]   from the podcast, "The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill."
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.160]   He said, "We should all be deconstructing our faith.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.480]   "We better do it, because our faith becomes a culture,
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.820]   "a culture so webbed into the impurity of truth
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.500]   "that it's hard to separate the two."
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.100]   Like, there are some things within Christian culture
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.700]   that need to be challenged, that deserve to be reevaluated.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.280]   But here's the thing, a Christ-honoring deconstruction,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.340]   it revels in truth and beauty,
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.800]   not cynicism and arrogance.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.720]   So let me illustrate it like this.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.820]   Several years ago, I decided to put together a desk
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.840]   that my wife needed for her home office.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.040]   And of course, the desk we ordered came in a million pieces.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.200]   And when I say a million, it actually felt like a million.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.840]   I mean, we unboxed it, I pulled it all out,
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.280]   and it covered the living room floor.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.920]   And yet, I knew this is my job as a husband.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.580]   And so I went to work, you know?
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.640]   I applied myself to the task at hand,
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.240]   and I was proud of the progress I was making.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.160]   Like, this thing was coming along swimmingly,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.400]   until I took the two tabletops,
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.120]   and I decided to bring them to an adjoining spot
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.480]   where they did not sit flush with one another.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.440]   And it occurred to me in that moment
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.860]   that something had grievously gone wrong.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.020]   So what did I do?
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.760]   Did I choose to think the instructions
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.780]   were misleading me the whole time?
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.440]   This is crazy, they clearly don't want me to build this desk.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.940]   No, that would have been a cynical response.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.320]   Did I consider the situation at hand and think,
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.520]   you know what, I know better than the manufacturer
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.760]   on how to build this desk.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.920]   I don't need these instructions.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.320]   I will assemble it on my own.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.220]   That would have been a proud response.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.200]   Instead, the right response,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.800]   which the response I took,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.840]   is I worked backwards through the instructions,
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.160]   disassembling the desk all along the way,
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.360]   until I identified this tiny,
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   critical little mistake that I made.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.920]   And yet after correcting that miss,
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.120]   I began to reconstruct the desk,
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.080]   and what I found was something beautiful
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.280]   and worthwhile to build in the end.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.040]   You see, the aim of deconstruction
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   is to ultimately rebuild a faith that is beautiful,
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.820]   which is why deconstruction without reconstruction
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.960]   is a tragedy, since every crisis of faith
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.360]   carries with it the potential to clarify your vision
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   for who God is.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.480]   Do you wanna know who God is?
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.680]   Like, this is an opportunity to know who God is,
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   to get greater clarity, eyes to see,
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.280]   a wider vision to bold who in fact he is,
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.160]   but not just that, you get a vision
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.360]   of what he's doing in the world.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.960]   Like, I know who God is, I know what he's doing,
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.220]   and just the cherry on top, I know how I fit into it all.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.960]   Like, that's the gift that deconstruction
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.920]   brings to the table, so long as you're willing
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.060]   to do the work of reconstructing your faith in the end.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   So what about those moments, those crises of faith
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.480]   that don't seem to clarify your vision of who God is,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.180]   they only seem to confuse it?
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.480]   What do you do when one minute,
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.400]   following God is the unquestionable part of your life,
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.640]   but then the next moment, because of the things you endured,
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.560]   the suffering you faced, you're questioning
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.560]   why you would even follow him to begin with.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.380]   How do you pick up and put back the pieces
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.860]   when you find yourself in a moment of suffering?
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.040]   That's what we're gonna talk about
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.620]   in our final lesson in the series.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.860]   And coincidentally, it's the final lesson
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:45.180]   that Jesus instructs his disciples on in John chapter 16.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.220]   Like, whenever you come to John 15, 16,
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.340]   and then you can include 17 into the mix,
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.820]   what you learn is that Jesus is giving an instruction
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.700]   to his disciples on what they can expect
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.860]   once he goes to the cross, right?
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.780]   Like, they know, or excuse me,
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.020]   he knows that he's about to be wrongly arrested,
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.740]   unjustly tried, and that he's going to be publicly executed.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.380]   And so to prepare them for what's ahead,
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.260]   he looks at them and says, "Hey, John 15,
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260]   "you need to make sure you're abiding in God,
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.800]   "that you're making your home with him,
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.060]   "that you're dwelling with him,
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.340]   "that you're depending on him,
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.980]   "because persecution is gonna come.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.860]   "But then don't worry, in time,
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.120]   "the Holy Spirit's gonna come as well.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.480]   "I'm sending in backup.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.780]   "You're gonna get some reinforcements.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.840]   "It's power from on high that is gonna come to you
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.060]   "and help you here in the today."
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.180]   But it's not only that.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.820]   You need to know too that though hardship is ahead,
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.620]   hope is as well, because though I am dying,
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.060]   rising, and returning to the Father, I will come back.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.420]   And it's into that context
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.000]   that we catch up to this conversation.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.740]   The disciples, they look at him in John 16, verse 29,
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.120]   and they say, in response to these things,
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.120]   "Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.380]   "Now we can see that you know all things
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.980]   "and that you do not even need
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.180]   "to have anyone ask you questions.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.480]   "This makes us believe that you came from God.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.640]   "Do you now believe?" Jesus replied.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.640]   "The time is coming, and in fact,
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.080]   "it has come when you will be scattered.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.820]   "Each to your own home, and you will leave me all alone."
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.100]   We'll stop right there.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.580]   We'll talk about this section first and foremost,
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.220]   because it contains our first point.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.180]   You see, we know on this side of history
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.040]   that Jesus is about to walk into the teeth of the enemy.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.020]   Like, we know that.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.980]   We've read the book, we've heard the stories,
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.080]   we've gone to Easter service.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.060]   We know that that's what Jesus is walking into.
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.620]   We're well aware of the fact
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.420]   that this is about to go seemingly horribly wrong for him.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.220]   But the disciples do not know that.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.480]   You see, they know, they even believe
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.660]   that Jesus is the Son of God,
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.860]   and he has come to inaugurate his kingdom,
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.900]   to establish it here on the earth.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.740]   And yet, some of the details
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.140]   of how that's all gonna work out
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.220]   have not necessarily settled for them yet.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.740]   And so what's going to happen
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.980]   is they're going to step out of this instruction,
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.860]   and they're going to go to the garden,
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.740]   and Jesus is going to be arrested,
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.340]   and all hell's gonna break loose.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.260]   Like, for these guys, the bottom's gonna fall out,
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.840]   their belief is going to break,
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.540]   they're gonna worry and panic
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.540]   that all of this is not going according to schedule.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.940]   They're going to feel a major crisis of faith.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.100]   They're going to begin to experience suffering
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.220]   that comes in the darkness of his death,
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.940]   and it leaves them in a spot
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:31.840]   where they're unsure if this guy is who he says he was,
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.360]   and if in fact, their life has amounted
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.780]   to nothing in the end.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.660]   You see, they respond in a way
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.940]   that many of us respond to whenever crisis comes.
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.740]   They run, they hide, and they panic.
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.100]   Because, and this is our first point,
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.340]   suffering reveals what we truly believe about God.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:55.140]   Suffering reveals what we truly believe about God.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.300]   What we believe about him, not just what we think about him.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.040]   Like, there's a big distinction in those two ideas.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.700]   To help you get clarity on the distinction,
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.260]   I asked Google AI.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.800]   It said, "Thinking refers to the mental process
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.160]   "of considering information,
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.200]   "evaluating possibilities, and forming ideas,
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.740]   "while believing signifies a stronger conviction
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.920]   "where someone accepts something is true.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.660]   "Often with a level of certainty and commitment."
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.120]   So just to put that very simply,
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.280]   the differences in thinking versus believing
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.740]   is thinking is all about information,
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.080]   whereas believing is all about conviction.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.680]   Like the disciples, they don't say,
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.520]   "You know what, Jesus, we've evaluated the evidence.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.300]   "We have inspected all of the data,
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.880]   "and we have decided that we think you are the son of God."
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.980]   That's not what they say.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.540]   They say, "We believe."
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.260]   From the text, "We believe you are the son of God."
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.260]   Like, we're staking our faith on it.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.060]   Like, we genuinely think in the core of our inner being
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.260]   that you are who you say you are,
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.420]   which is why it's so disorienting for them
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.980]   and for ourselves whenever suffering strikes
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.040]   and everything we believe starts to break down.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.940]   Like, we often do what they did.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.020]   Like, we scatter when crisis comes.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.540]   We desert Jesus when difficulty develops.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.760]   We abandon whenever the adversity strikes.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.300]   And the reason we do is
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.940]   we have an insufficient belief in God.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.460]   You see, rather than believing
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.700]   that God is intrinsically good,
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.560]   we instead believe that he's only good
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.020]   when things go according to our plan.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.100]   Or rather than believing that God is intrinsically kind,
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.220]   we only believe he's kind
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.380]   if he looks out for us in the ways that we need.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.220]   Or rather than believing that God is intrinsically loving,
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.300]   we question just how loving he is
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.440]   if he doesn't intervene into that situation
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.100]   and produce this sort of outcome.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.640]   Like, contrary to the typical arguments
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.520]   around this problem of evil,
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.860]   most people, when it comes to evil and pain and suffering,
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.760]   is they don't deconstruct
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.440]   because God is some genocidal maniac.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.080]   You better follow his rules or else.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.800]   Like, that's not why most people actually deconstruct.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.260]   Now, that's an issue that there are really good answers for.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.380]   In fact, a few weeks back, TA,
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.100]   he spent about 45 minutes here from this stage
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.480]   teaching on Sunday service through that problem.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.940]   You should totally go listen to it
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.620]   if you actually want the answers
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.340]   to why God would do those sorts of things.
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.320]   And yet that's not normally
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.200]   why people deconstruct from the faith.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.380]   Instead, the answer to that question
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.260]   is what people use to substantiate
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.460]   their deconstruction from the faith.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.880]   You see, most people deconstruct from the faith
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.720]   because their spiritual spiraling
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.980]   is not the product of the existence of evil,
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.220]   that it's out there, ooh,
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.260]   but from the experience of it.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.360]   That's why people deconstruct.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.000]   They experience evil, some suffering,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.180]   that has called God's character into question.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.040]   And so they've called him to the carpet
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.680]   and they're wondering, hey, are you even actually true?
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.120]   And yet if we want to consider some truth claims,
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.320]   the first thing we need to know is that God doesn't cause evil.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.560]   God doesn't cause evil.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.000]   That's the first truth you gotta know
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   if you're gonna unpack this problem
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.600]   is that 1 John 1:5 would say,
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.480]   "This is the message we've heard from him
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.260]   "and we proclaim to you, that God is light
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.880]   "and in him, there's no darkness, there's no evil at all."
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.440]   James 1:13 would say, "Let no one say when he's tempted,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.520]   "I am being tempted by God,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.640]   "for God cannot be tempted with evil
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.100]   "and he himself tempts no one."
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.680]   Okay, Kylan, I get that.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.000]   Like I understand the fact that God doesn't cause evil,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.680]   but that doesn't omit the fact
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.120]   that there's pain and suffering in this life.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.320]   So if it's not coming from God,
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.840]   then where in fact is it coming from?
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.320]   Well, I'm really glad you asked
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.380]   because there are four good sources
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.580]   from which we can categorize evil.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.400]   The first would be moral evil, moral evil.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.440]   This is the evil that we perpetuate
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.540]   against one another as human beings.
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.800]   Like this is what we do when we act in a way
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.380]   that is not in accordance with God's will.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.580]   So things like murder and robbery and rape and racism
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.440]   and hatred and jealousy and adultery and embezzlement,
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:20.360]   all of those things, those are acts of moral evil.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.240]   And we're typically responsible for those ourselves.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.860]   Next to moral evil, there's natural evil.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.840]   Like these are those calamitous events
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.200]   that come into our world,
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.260]   yet are separate from any moral decision.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.120]   Tornadoes, floods, fires, congenital diseases,
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.120]   like these are the things
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.800]   that natural disasters categorize.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.840]   It's a product of the fall in Genesis 3,
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.320]   and it proliferates over the course of time
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.080]   as things grow worse and worse and worse.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.920]   The third category would be spiritual evil.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.840]   You see, we live in a world
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.720]   where spiritual warfare is very real.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.620]   An unseen realm does in fact exist,
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:00.760]   and pain and suffering, they are induced by the demonic.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.560]   Now, let me be abundantly clear.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.360]   Not everything is the devil,
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.240]   but some things are the devil.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.040]   Like just because you hit a nail on the road
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.960]   and you got a flat tire,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.120]   it's not 'cause the devil's out to get ya, you know?
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.380]   Oh, he did it again!
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.880]   Calm down, brother, you probably just hit a nail.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.240]   Not everything is, but some things are,
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.000]   and so it's good for us to consider,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.600]   man, what in life might actually be the product
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.760]   of a deep darkness?
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.160]   Because as you look into the halls of history
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.560]   and you evaluate some of the circumstances in our day,
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.240]   while it's difficult to ascribe what source is at play,
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.880]   those atrocities that you see,
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.360]   that just have an insidiousness to them,
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.480]   that may very well be the cause
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.760]   of something spiritually dark.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.800]   And then the fourth one,
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.000]   the one that's most important for this room,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.260]   is personal evil.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.980]   Because the shortest answer to the problem of evil is you.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.740]   It's me.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.480]   Like if there was a world
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.680]   where there was no spiritual darkness
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.320]   and there was no natural disaster and you lived within it,
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.400]   evil would still exist,
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.880]   because you're there, because I'm there.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.560]   Great case in point is Tom Hanks in the movie "Castaway."
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.640]   Tom Hanks is what?
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.320]   Deserted on an island all by himself.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.200]   There's no one there for him to hurt.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.960]   There's no one there for him to harm.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.160]   And yet Tom Hanks somehow finds a way
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.320]   to sin against Wilson!
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.000]   A volleyball.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.580]   Like he, within a vacuum,
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.280]   locked away all by himself,
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.660]   still acts evil.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.960]   This is a good example of personal evil.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.280]   You see, it could be a combination of any of these things
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.640]   that explain the evil pain and suffering
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.640]   that you experience in life.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.020]   But the overarching point
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.880]   is that there are credible explanations
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.280]   for the suffering we experience
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.380]   that don't condemn God's character.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.240]   So why doesn't he do something about it?
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.300]   Why doesn't God do something about it?
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.480]   If he can, why won't he?
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.680]   He will.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:11.460]   God will do something about evil.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.240]   And he might do something about it,
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   the suffering that surrounds you within your day.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:27.720]   But often, God will not do something
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.480]   because he has very good reason.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.080]   And that reason is one we see in 2 Peter 3, 9.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.160]   The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promises,
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.640]   as some count slowness.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.740]   But he is patient toward you,
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.880]   not wishing that any should perish,
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.520]   but that all should reach repentance.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.440]   You see, God, he will right every wrong,
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.640]   wipe every tear, mend every wound, cure every hurt.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.180]   But he will not do it just not yet.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.720]   And the reason why is because he is beckoning people
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.080]   to come to him.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.820]   He wants deeply for people to come to him.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.360]   Like, it's so ironic.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.440]   Like God is willing to suffer our sins a little bit longer
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.480]   so that you and I don't have to suffer our sins forever.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.000]   Like, who's the one that's actually suffering here?
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.520]   It's God.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:27.520]   Like, God deserves justice against all godlessness.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.680]   And he could do it right now.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.840]   It could be over and he wouldn't be wrong for it.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.320]   He would be right because evil deserves to be judged.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.320]   And yet it is in his mercy that he slows the clock.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.760]   He provides us time because he's beckoning us to come home.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.360]   That's not bad news.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.300]   That is good news.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.960]   Like, that's not an evil God.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.000]   That is a merciful God.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.680]   Like, that's a God that's playing the long game,
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.920]   that's trying to pursue as many people as he can.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.840]   And that should change things for you and I.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   Like, Christian, if you're in the room tonight
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.320]   and you're suffering through something,
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.920]   that should change your perspective.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.640]   God has not solved your issue
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.800]   because he is trying to solve the world's issue.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.600]   He's trying to bring people back home.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.160]   Now, listen, as I say that,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.720]   I know that some of you instinctively feel this.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.040]   So what, you're just telling me to suck it up?
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.040]   Like, you just want me to grit it out?
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.540]   You want me to just like suck my tear back up
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.300]   into its duct?
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.840]   No, that's not what I'm saying.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:38.280]   But I am saying this should shift our perspective
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.880]   when we consider suffering,
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.340]   which is exactly where Jesus goes next.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.520]   We'll look at 32 again.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.600]   He says, "The time is coming.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.040]   And in fact, it has come when you will be scattered,
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.520]   each of you to your own home.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.120]   You will leave me all alone.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.900]   Yet I am not alone, for my father is with me."
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.400]   You see, everyone in this story,
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.240]   they make a decision about what direction
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.320]   they're going to run whenever suffering comes.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.200]   And the decision they make,
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.480]   it depends on their purpose in that suffering.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.600]   Because no one chooses what they suffer,
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.440]   but everyone chooses how they suffer.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.580]   No one chooses what they suffer,
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.040]   but everyone chooses how they suffer.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:22.960]   And here's the thing,
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.480]   how you suffer depends on your purpose in life.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.040]   So listen to me.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.840]   If you think your purpose is your happiness,
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.360]   your comfort, your wellbeing,
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.600]   it's no surprise you're disappointed.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.760]   Because that is not Jesus's promise here.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.800]   He looks at us and he says,
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.080]   "Hey, you're going to have trouble.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.320]   It's going to come."
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.520]   Like the world is not yet right in all of its wrong.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.440]   God has not yet come back and fixed all things.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.320]   So for you to expect that you're going to be happy,
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.480]   means that you're expecting something
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.320]   that will sorely disappoint you.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.120]   If you think that's your purpose,
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.000]   Jesus is pleading with you
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.840]   the way that he's pleading with the disciples.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.920]   And he's saying, "Hey, no, no, no, listen to me.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.160]   There's a better purpose for you than that."
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.600]   Like your purpose isn't comfort, it isn't materialism.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.960]   It isn't the gods of Dallas, Texas in your life
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.680]   or wherever it is you're listening from.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.360]   Instead, your purpose is transcendent.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   It is to know God.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.560]   That's crazy.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.280]   It's to know God.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.560]   Like to actually know him,
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.040]   not just to ingest a bunch of facts
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.000]   and ascend intellectually and then regurgitate that,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.180]   that information for other people to learn.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.060]   It's to learn as much about him as you can,
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.160]   that it might develop within your innermost man and woman,
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.280]   deep love for him.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.680]   And the natural expression of knowing a God like that
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.720]   is you tell everybody.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.160]   You tell everybody.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.800]   Like anybody watching a new show in the room, show of hands.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.960]   You watching a new show, something on HBO or Amazon
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.520]   or Paramount or whatever your streaming service is.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.360]   Okay, leave your hand up if you've told someone about it.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.360]   You clearly think that's worthy of worship.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.620]   But there is a purpose greater
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.720]   than making your favorite TV show known.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.680]   It is to make God known.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.840]   He is infinitely better.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.920]   That feels weird that I even have to say it.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.280]   He is infinitely better.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.680]   And he's begging you to believe it.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.600]   He's begging you to believe it.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.280]   And he's actually, he's hoping your suffering
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.980]   will be helping in moving you to the knowledge
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.480]   that maybe you've settled for a purpose too small.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:50.700]   You see, your purpose has power over suffering.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:58.320]   For reference, legend has it that famed Italian violinist
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.360]   Niccolo Paganini went before an audience to perform
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.200]   just like you.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.800]   And yet as he stepped out in front of the crowd,
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.200]   what he realized is he did not have
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.840]   his famed instrument with him, his trustworthy tool,
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   the violin that had led him to such notoriety.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.120]   Instead of waiting him on stage was a secondhand instrument,
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.280]   one that was old, decrepit, and not worthy of playing.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.580]   And so as he looked at the audience, he said,
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.700]   "Please give me just a moment."
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.160]   And he snuck backstage and looked behind the curtain
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.360]   and inspected the rest of the auditorium for his violin.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.060]   And yet what he learned is that his violin was stolen.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.360]   And they had left this one instead,
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.100]   trying to sabotage his purpose.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.600]   And yet as the report reads,
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.480]   Niccolo took that secondhand instrument
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.640]   and he looked to the crowd and said,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.760]   "Ladies and gentlemen, I will show you
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.360]   "that the music is not in the instrument.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.560]   "It's in the soul."
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.680]   And he began to play that violin in such a way
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.360]   that enraptured enthusiasm gripped the crowd
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.440]   as the music poured off of the platform
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.720]   and it descended across the seats
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.200]   and it touched every heart and it captivated all attention.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.360]   They actually write that it felt like the ceiling
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.360]   of the room would blow off the space
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.000]   because of the ruckus, applause, and accord
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.920]   that were coming from the people listening in.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.460]   They said Niccolo had never played
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.400]   the way he played that day.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:37.980]   What is Niccolo trying to teach you and I?
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.600]   (whispering)
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:47.540]   That a moment of crisis cannot confront someone
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.340]   nor conflict them if they're convinced of their purpose.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.700]   You see, crisis is coming for us all.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.620]   For some of us, it's come already.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.400]   And either it will define your purpose
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.580]   or your purpose will define it.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.800]   For the disciples, the crisis of Christ's crucifixion
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.460]   and the ensuing suffering they experienced
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.540]   and the darkness of his death,
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.200]   it redefined everything for them.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.980]   You read their stories and what you learn
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.540]   is some of them ran for the hills,
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.060]   others went back to their old jobs,
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:19.060]   and Peter outright denied the fact that he followed Christ.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.780]   Everything they had spent the last three years of their life,
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.380]   the new purpose they had received from God,
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:30.380]   they were willing to abandon the moment crisis struck
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:31.880]   and suffering ensued.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   And yet you see, Jesus has a very different response
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.380]   because crisis didn't define his purpose.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.140]   His purpose defined his crisis.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.160]   It defined his suffering.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:47.100]   When you read through Christ's arrest,
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.040]   you don't see him rally the boys together
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.800]   and prepare to present a defense.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.400]   What you see is he actually heals a guy.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.100]   He speaks and the soldiers fall backwards
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.640]   and he comes with hands together,
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.020]   ready to be cuffed and taken away.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.660]   As he stands before the Sanhedrin
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.060]   and they can't get two testimonial accounts together
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:14.420]   to actually convict him of a wrongful accusation,
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.300]   Jesus steps forward anyways,
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.380]   knowing the proceedings must carry forward
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.700]   if he is going to go to the cross,
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.080]   die for the sins of the world,
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.420]   rise forth from the grave
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.860]   and lead us in everlasting life,
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.900]   he chooses to indict himself.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.020]   And as he hangs on the cross,
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:34.020]   Jesus doesn't asphyxiate
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.540]   the way that most men do
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.060]   and the way that instrument of execution
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.580]   was designed to kill.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.420]   Instead, the way Mark recalls it,
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:51.020]   is he says, "Jesus uttered a loud cry
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.120]   "and he breathed his last."
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:57.300]   If you're suffocating to death,
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.180]   you don't breathe a loud cry.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.860]   You don't shout in a final breath of declaration
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.060]   that it's finished.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.500]   It says just a couple of verses down,
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.420]   "When the centurion who stood facing him
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.420]   "saw that in this way he breathed his last,
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.220]   "a guy that had seen many, many, many, many,
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.260]   "many men breathe their last,
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:23.680]   "he said, 'Truly, that guy is the son of God.'"
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.140]   Jesus didn't let his sufferings define his purpose
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:31.140]   and we don't have to let our sufferings define ours either.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:33.980]   But how do you do that?
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.820]   Like how do you actually endure suffering,
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.760]   encounter evil, push through it
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.260]   in a way that looks like Christ?
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.220]   Well, you do what he did.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.620]   You remember what he remembered,
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.460]   that his father was with him.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.620]   You must remember the same, that God hasn't left you.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.900]   Like he hasn't abandoned you.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.220]   He hasn't lost sight of you.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.700]   He hasn't run out on you.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.780]   So many of us in a deconstructed phase
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.900]   think God is nowhere to be found.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.380]   He's right here.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.060]   He's still close.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:06.980]   He's with you.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.140]   You've just lost sight.
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.140]   Like I know some of you, like you're in chronic pain
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.500]   and yet he's right there with you.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.780]   He's telling you, "Hey, even though it feels so hard,
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.740]   "I will sustain you."
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.340]   Some of you, you feel betrayed
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.740]   because of what they said or what they did.
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.960]   And yet he's looking and saying,
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.140]   "Hey, I'm never gonna betray you.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.180]   "I will never leave you nor forsake you."
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.420]   Some of you feel so lonely
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.980]   and he is there with you in the loneliness,
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.740]   simply saying, "Hey, your soul was not made
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.820]   "for anyone else but me."
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.260]   Some of you, you look at the loss of a loved one
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.220]   and you are gripped with such despair
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.060]   and yet he is telling you,
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.740]   "Hey, death doesn't get the last word over them."
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.260]   Some of you, you've been abused in your story,
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.460]   mentally, emotionally, sexually at some point.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:59.260]   And he's saying, "Hey, I can mend every wound,
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.100]   "even the unseen scars.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.660]   "I'm with you."
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.580]   He is with us in it,
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.600]   whatever it is that you suffer through now,
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.180]   he's with you in it.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.860]   And listen, this might be the most important thing I say,
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:18.860]   it is not most loving of God to take our suffering away.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:26.660]   It is most loving of God to enter our sufferings himself.
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:31.820]   Some of you want him to chop her over,
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.860]   pull you out and rescue you to some other spot.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:41.460]   And yet his heart is one that sees you in the flame of fire
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.020]   and parachutes right in.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.980]   And he stands beside you through it all.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.940]   This is his heart.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.460]   And we see it in the person of Jesus.
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.100]   Like Jesus, he entered into our suffering.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:57.020]   Listen, he had a pretty cush existence
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.320]   before he showed up, okay?
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.820]   He had no good reason to come from heaven down here below.
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.460]   And yet he chose to anyways, why?
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.500]   Because he wants to be with you.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.340]   And he wants you to be with him,
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.780]   not just now, but forever.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.900]   He has stepped into our sufferings,
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.580]   but here's the thing, not just to sit in them with us,
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.320]   but to lead us through them,
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.820]   which is where we'll finish.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.740]   Verse 33, "I have told you these things
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.380]   "so that in me you may have peace.
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.200]   "In this world, you will have trouble,
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.180]   "but take heart, I have overcome the world."
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.540]   Like Jesus doesn't promise a pain-free existence
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.580]   or an easygoing life.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.200]   He tells us, "Hey, this world is anything but perfect.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.540]   "And yet here's the thing you need to know,
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.980]   "peace is possible."
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.020]   Wait, what'd you say?
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.740]   Peace is actually possible for me?
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.900]   Yeah, that's what I said.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.040]   How is it possible?
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.980]   It's possible in me,
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.740]   which was really convicting for me to read
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.020]   because I was reading through that.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:53.860]   I thought to myself,
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:58.600]   how often do I look for peace in other places than Jesus?
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.320]   Like he's often not the one that I'm looking for peace in.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.320]   In fact, I would rewrite that to say,
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.120]   "In this world, you will have trouble."
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:05.960]   Oh, excuse me.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.360]   "So that in my circumstances, you may have peace.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.240]   "So that in your future, you may have peace.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.340]   "So that in your job, you may have peace.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.120]   "Or so that in your justice, you may have peace."
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.640]   I try to replace the fact that peace is only
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.840]   and solely found in him.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.280]   How are you trying to replace the place
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.640]   where Jesus' peace is solely and only available?
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.260]   You're looking elsewhere?
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.200]   Like, do you think it's gonna come from a new job
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   after you faced a layoff?
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.400]   No peace in that.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.000]   Justice against a person that hurts you,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.680]   cure for yours or someone else's illness,
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.420]   relief from your past.
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.640]   There's no peace, true God-given peace in those things.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.920]   Now, let me be clear.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.900]   Wanting for an end to suffering
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.880]   is a desire worthy of wanting.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.080]   God wants an end to suffering himself.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   He will accomplish that, in fact.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.280]   And yet, the only place that peace is truly found
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.700]   is in Christ.
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.120]   Because peace isn't found in suffering removed,
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.080]   it's found in suffering redeemed.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.480]   Peace isn't found in suffering removed,
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.760]   it is found in suffering redeemed.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.960]   Like, so often, God will not change your situation
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.820]   because he is trying to use your situation to change you.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.960]   Since it's in the midst of suffering, not outside of it,
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.360]   that we are best able to decide
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.240]   what we want to be true of our lives
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.240]   once we get outside of suffering again.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.400]   So let me ask you so very graciously,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.600]   because I know some of you are hurting here.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:47.640]   If you're in a season of suffering,
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.280]   are you counting down the days
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.220]   until God changes your circumstance?
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.400]   Or are you making the days count
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.840]   that God has given you now?
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.040]   Like, if you're in a season of suffering,
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.800]   are you complaining against God,
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.080]   raging against the heavens,
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.440]   or are you actually considering the fact
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.080]   that maybe he's trying to do something in you
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.560]   and through you today?
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.600]   If you're in a season of suffering,
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.760]   are you looking at your situation with old eyes,
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.640]   tired eyes, or are you looking upon it
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.240]   and evaluating carefully with a new God-given perspective
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.120]   of what suffering might actually accomplish?
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.380]   Like, listen, as hard as it is to believe,
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.000]   suffering circumstances are often the perfect condition
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.920]   for your growth in God's glory.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.160]   Like, they're the perfect condition
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.760]   for your growth in God's glory.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.440]   Like Romans 5, 3, 5 says,
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.360]   "Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings."
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.080]   Because we know that suffering, it produces perseverance,
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.880]   and perseverance, character, and character, hope,
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.120]   and hope does not put us to shame
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.680]   because God's love has been poured out into our hearts
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.120]   through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:02.000]   So does anybody in here follow viticulture,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   winemaking, show of hands?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.600]   Don't do that, you're in church.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.200]   I don't follow it very closely,
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.720]   but there is one common knowledge amongst all winemakers,
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.160]   and it's this, that the hardest soil
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.240]   produces the greatest grapes.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.800]   Why is that?
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:30.520]   Because it's in difficult ground
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:36.640]   that though you may not yield a great quantity of fruit,
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.220]   you actually yield the greatest quality of fruit
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.560]   because it's in difficult soil
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.920]   that those grape clusters receive the most character,
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.800]   that the vine itself,
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.480]   as it draws nutrients through its roots,
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.200]   prioritizes what's most important,
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:42:00.120]   which is to produce a fruit that is filled with life.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:07.320]   That's what your suffering offers you the opportunity for,
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:13.280]   to produce something of great character, great flavor,
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.920]   a multifaceted experience,
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.840]   the likes of which transcend other bland ways of living.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.200]   Hebrews 12, 11, it says,
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.600]   "For the moment, all discipline seems painful
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.660]   "rather than pleasant,
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.880]   "but later that discipline yields the peaceful fruit
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.660]   "of righteousness to those who have been trained by it."
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.040]   You see, according to Jesus,
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.000]   success isn't suffering avoided, it is suffering endured.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.280]   And I'll admit, the world is right.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.360]   So many Christians follow Jesus
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.320]   because they've never suffered anything.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.680]   And yet what the world will not admit to you
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.080]   is the very strongest of Christians
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.040]   are those that have suffered something.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.560]   They have lived through hell,
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.640]   and they stand to tell the tale.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   God will produce something worthy, glorious,
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.680]   beautiful in you by way of the suffering it is you're under.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.120]   We will all suffer,
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.280]   and yet our sufferings, they're not final.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.300]   Like they don't get the last laugh, they're not fatal.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.520]   We have hope beyond the grave,
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.360]   and they're not futile because our pain isn't purposeless.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:35.280]   I started tonight with a story about three friends,
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.360]   and yet I didn't finish their stories.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.600]   Because while each of them found themselves
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.840]   in a moment of great crises,
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:46.200]   where they questioned their faith, they doubted in God,
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.800]   God redeemed all of their suffering.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.880]   For my friend, the one that wanted to go to medical school,
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.560]   he actually went to medical school, he's a doctor today.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.880]   And he went under the endorsement of the very professor
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.200]   that threatened to withhold the opportunity from him.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.100]   That professor looked at him and said,
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.640]   there's something unique about this guy
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.600]   that he wouldn't defend himself,
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.960]   but he would preserve his witness for the sake of Christ.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:21.240]   That young lady, though she's lost her family,
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.780]   she began a new one, married a Christian guy.
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:27.920]   And now their family is one
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.320]   that has produced generational change
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.600]   for those that will come after her.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.320]   Her family will be a family unlike the family before,
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.280]   her family will be a family of a people that follow God.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:46.780]   And the last guy, the one who was betrayed
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.180]   and slandered and gossiped about by his friends,
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:55.200]   he actually now today in his church leads a Bible study,
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:00.440]   calling people to belong to a family
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:04.040]   that will accept them free of judgment
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.000]   and void of any criticism.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.660]   Friends, we will suffer, some of us have already,
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.000]   and yet that suffering can be redeemed.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.320]   God is not evil for our hardships,
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.480]   he's good because he's made a way through them all.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.280]   Like he redeems those sufferings now,
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.720]   and yet what we know is he will remove
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.240]   those sufferings forever.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.400]   For this is what he's promised in Christ.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.600]   Like suffering reveals what we truly believe about God,
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.960]   that in God we have a long-suffering Savior
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.080]   who endured our sin until he could send his son.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:42.600]   In God we know that while we wouldn't choose to suffer,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.400]   he would choose to suffer, suffer for the sins
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.280]   of people like you and me, even to the point of death.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:53.680]   And we know that that same God in the person of Jesus
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.120]   came to bring peace to our suffering,
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.360]   not only redeeming what we endure today,
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.240]   but promising defeat for that which we suffer
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.200]   for all eternity.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.480]   If you're here and you're suffering,
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.840]   there's only one way to never suffer again,
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.080]   and it's in him.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.320]   Will you place your faith in him
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.400]   and come to know him tonight?
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.200]   Let me pray for you.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.240]   God, I'm so grateful and thankful, God, for your word.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:25.320]   Oh God, I thank you for how sufficient it is.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.240]   The fact, God, that from its pages,
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.720]   even to this day, right now in a room like this,
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.480]   you still speak to us.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.200]   And the words you speak to us
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.240]   are not words of condemnation,
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.520]   they're not words of judgment,
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.640]   they're words of love.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.200]   They're words of relationship, invitation,
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.000]   a welcoming reception, God,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.600]   that any person that would place their faith in Jesus
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.360]   for the forgiveness of their sins
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.360]   and calling him Lord of their life
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.760]   might actually be united to you again.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.640]   I pray, God.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.760]   Oh God, I wanna spend a moment here now,
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.800]   but Lord, you do not need me
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.880]   to do what you, God, alone can do,
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.080]   which is work in the hearts of these friends,
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.960]   move God amongst these seats,
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.920]   stir up our spirits, save our souls,
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:17.000]   and save us from our suffering,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.560]   if not today, one day.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.960]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
