1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
 - All right, hey guys, this is about to be really,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,560
 really fun, and I'm so excited for this moment.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,860
 When we were kind of planning the Awaken conference

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,900
 for you guys, we were just thinking,

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,060
 "Hey, what all do we think?"

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,200
 We take really seriously who we allow on this stage

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,000
 and who is teaching you guys the word of God

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,640
 and who is speaking into your lives,

9
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,480
 and we were just thinking,

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,780
 "What does this group of people need to hear,

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,340
 "and who do they need to hear from?"

12
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,480
 And I am so excited.

13
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,480
 God has just blessed our generation

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,720
 with so many passionate leaders

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,120
 who have gone before us and who are spending their life

16
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,360
 making sure that we are resourced and ready

17
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,340
 to have an abiding relationship with Jesus

18
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,960
 and to share him with the world.

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,600
 And so what we're gonna do in this time

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,040
 is just bring up some leaders of our generation.

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,200
 I'm just gonna ask them questions,

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,340
 and we just put together questions

23
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,540
 that we think that would be really helpful

24
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,380
 for you guys to hear.

25
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,720
 They're not saying, "Hey, I have all the answers,"

26
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
 but what they are doing is hoping

27
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,180
 that they can be helpful to you.

28
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,280
 And so if you would, please help me.

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,620
 Welcome to the stage,

30
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,460
 David Marvin, Jonathan Bacluda, and Jenny Allen.

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,460
 (audience cheering)

32
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:15,900
 ♪ Isn't she lovely ♪

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,740
 David, you're on this side, actually.

34
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,580
 - Look at this.

35
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,400
 Oh, I'm over here?

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,240
 - We didn't talk about this, man.

37
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,180
 Come on, we're over here.

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,020
 - I'm in the right place.

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,280
 - You're wearing a blazer.

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,580
 Feel so unprepared for this.

41
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,240
 - Hey, she came to do business with Jesus.

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,080
 All right?

43
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,920
 - Hey.

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,760
 - All right.

45
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,460
 Well, hey, thank you guys for being here.

46
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,220
 I know we already heard from DMARV last night,

47
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,500
 which, by the way, what a way to kick off

48
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,220
 the conference last night.

49
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,800
 Amazing.

50
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,200
 We get to hear from these two later on in the conference.

51
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,160
 So excited.

52
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,240
 But before we do that, let's just have some fun.

53
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,060
 Sound good?

54
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,760
 How long have you two, specifically JP and David,

55
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,600
 how long have y'all known each other?

56
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,680
 - Six months, seven months?

57
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,500
 Yeah.

58
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,340
 - Yeah.

59
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,540
 - At least around there.

60
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,640
 - We have known each other for 12 years.

61
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,780
 - Wow.

62
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,480
 - A little over 12 years.

63
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,320
 - Okay.

64
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,160
 That's cool.

65
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,980
 I like that.

66
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,860
 - It feels like 12 minutes.

67
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,680
 - Yeah.

68
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,520
 - Yeah.

69
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,720
 Is his mic on?

70
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,560
 Mic for Jonathan.

71
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,760
 - Can y'all hear JP?

72
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,900
 - You can hear it?

73
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,720
 - Okay.

74
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,560
 - It feels like 12 minutes.

75
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
 - Not much has changed.

76
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,220
 - Underwater.

77
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,200
 - A lot less graphic tees

78
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,960
 and sparkly things on his jeans.

79
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
 - Yeah.

80
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,440
 - No, you did not.

81
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,900
 - Oh, we for sure did.

82
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,080
 - Like buckle jeans?

83
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,300
 - That's the problem with the internet

84
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,140
 is that stuff's out there forever.

85
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,300
 - It lives.

86
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,040
 - Hey, there's some pictures of DMarv out there too.

87
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,880
 - Oh yeah.

88
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,720
 - Y'all know David was a model?

89
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,540
 - Let's not go there.

90
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,380
 - Did everyone know that?

91
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,220
 - Let's not go there.

92
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,040
 - Look it up.

93
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,880
 (audience laughing)

94
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,280
 Well, I thought that we would just start off

95
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,560
 with just asking some fun,

96
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,720
 get to know you, just kind of rapid fire questions.

97
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,560
 Just a few.

98
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,380
 Does that sound good?

99
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,220
 - Yeah, man.

100
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,060
 - Okay, sweet.

101
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,520
 If you had to recommend one book

102
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
 for everyone to read,

103
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,660
 like you've got to read this book,

104
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,360
 what book are you recommending?

105
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,200
 - Outdated.

106
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,100
 (audience cheering)

107
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,080
 - Oh, that was good.

108
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,900
 - Did I say it right?

109
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,740
 - Did you pay him?

110
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,580
 - Yeah, you said it right.

111
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,400
 - Did I say it right?

112
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,240
 - You said it right.

113
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,340
 - That's a great question.

114
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,040
 I mean, y'all, that is a great resource too.

115
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,420
 - I'm like the least, I'm not a big reader.

116
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,220
 So just to out myself right there,

117
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,580
 I don't enjoy reading.

118
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,220
 So I'm a big audible guy,

119
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,940
 but I feel like everybody has great answers.

120
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,660
 You're going to say something amazing.

121
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,500
 - I am.

122
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,320
 - Get out of your head or something.

123
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,000
 (audience laughing)

124
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,180
 - You know, I mean, there's so many,

125
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,980
 but A.W. Tozer wrote a book called "The Pursuit of God."

126
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,020
 And I, for the most part.

127
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,020
 Yeah, I mean, for the most part, I try to read that.

128
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,660
 That's one of those I read almost every year.

129
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,720
 If you have never read that, go back to the classics,

130
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,560
 read some of those,

131
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,260
 because there's something about dead guys,

132
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,580
 that, you know, and dead women,

133
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,100
 that it's timeless.

134
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,220
 You know that it lives.

135
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,100
 At the same time, you know, our books are good too.

136
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,940
 (laughing)

137
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,060
 And we're still alive.

138
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
 We're still alive.

139
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,420
 - Book "Humility," you told me about.

140
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,260
 - Yeah, that's right.

141
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,080
 - Yeah.

142
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,700
 - "Humility" by Andrew Murray is another one I read often,

143
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,660
 because, you know, we just live in a culture

144
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,780
 that that's not valued.

145
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,700
 And so to put it in my mind constantly

146
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,100
 of this is how I wanna live,

147
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,020
 this is who I wanna be,

148
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,500
 this, and it's not something that we can muster up,

149
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,980
 that what Andrew talks about is this is something

150
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,180
 we become as we are with Jesus.

151
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,500
 So that's helpful too.

152
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,660
 - That's good.

153
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,020
 - Anything by C.S. Lewis.

154
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,780
 The Problem of Pain is probably the book I've read

155
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,980
 more than any other book.

156
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,420
 And the description in chapter nine of heaven,

157
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,980
 I think is one of the most powerful descriptions

158
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,300
 as he just reflects.

159
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,980
 And specifically, there's a line where he talks about,

160
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,300
 hey, there's times in my heart of heart,

161
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,420
 or there's times I think we don't desire heaven,

162
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,900
 but more often I find myself wondering

163
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,980
 if in our heart of hearts we have ever desired

164
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,140
 anything else.

165
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,740
 And he puts together how every longing

166
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,260
 from the very first breath you take

167
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,980
 to the very last one that you take

168
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,420
 has been longing to be reunited

169
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,020
 with your creator and with heaven.

170
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,540
 But mere Christianity, anything by C.S. Lewis.

171
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,180
 - Yeah, so I think they covered the dead guys,

172
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,620
 which I'm not smart enough to read those guys.

173
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,300
 But just a few, like Crazy Love,

174
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,260
 God impacted my life in a major way when I read that book.

175
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,560
 It just kind of opened something up inside of me

176
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,820
 that I was a part of Christianity

177
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,980
 that I wasn't experiencing and living.

178
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,020
 A Praying Life by Paul Miller,

179
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,380
 God used to revolutionize my prayer life

180
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,580
 and just change that.

181
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,220
 And so those are two that come to mind for me.

182
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,500
 And I--

183
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,340
 - Okay, guys, we gotta keep moving.

184
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,380
 - Okay, okay, keep moving.

185
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,820
 - I know y'all like books very, very--

186
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,660
 - I've read both their books

187
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,060
 and they're excellent resources.

188
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,900
 - Yeah, for sure.

189
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,140
 - I say that with full integrity,

190
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,980
 that they're really--

191
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,180
 - And, no, just kidding.

192
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,300
 - Yeah. (laughing)

193
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,580
 Okay, what are your middle names?

194
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,700
 - Mine's so good.

195
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,540
 - What is it?

196
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,380
 - Mine's better.

197
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,420
 - Mine's, there's no way.

198
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,260
 Y'all.

199
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,100
 - His is better.

200
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,940
 - Okay, you go first.

201
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
 - No, you go first.

202
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,540
 - Well, mine's so Jesus-y, it's Faith.

203
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,100
 And I'm not kidding, that is my middle name.

204
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,940
 That's what my parents--

205
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,820
 - Mine's Jesus.

206
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,260
 - No, it's not.

207
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,100
 - No, it's not, I'm kidding.

208
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,940
 - It's actually Jesus.

209
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,780
 - Jesus.

210
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,420
 - Jenny Faith Allen, I like that.

211
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,260
 - Yeah, yeah.

212
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,220
 - JP?

213
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,380
 - So my middle name is Bob, B-O-B.

214
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,700
 (laughing)

215
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,380
 Not Robert.

216
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,220
 - Not Robert.

217
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,060
 - Not Robert, not Bobby.

218
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,900
 - Wow.

219
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,820
 - So my name, so I'm from a small town, South Texas.

220
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,700
 So I am John Bob, okay?

221
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,540
 That's--

222
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,740
 (laughing)

223
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,580
 - JB.

224
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,420
 - That just happened.

225
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,260
 - Okay.

226
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,100
 - And your family calls you JB.

227
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,940
 - They call me JB.

228
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,780
 - Not JP.

229
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,540
 - So forever in my life, I was JB.

230
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,180
 - And forever at this conference, you are now JB.

231
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,020
 - No, I think we go with John Bob.

232
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,740
 - Yeah, John Bob, I like it.

233
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,580
 John Bob.

234
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,780
 - Mine is not nearly as good as James.

235
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,940
 The brother of our Lord.

236
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,220
 - Yeah, David James, we get it.

237
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,260
 Okay, you love the Bible.

238
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,100
 All right.

239
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,940
 (laughing)

240
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,220
 - Wow.

241
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,980
 (applauding)

242
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,460
 - He said, you know your Bible.

243
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,980
 - All right, let's go on to like,

244
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,720
 the serious questions now, let's move on.

245
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,620
 Okay, we're gonna start with you, JP.

246
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,100
 We are definitely, I would say, a high feeler generation.

247
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,980
 We feel things deeply.

248
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,100
 We tend to be a little emotionally led, I would say.

249
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,660
 And what would you say if I have not, in a season,

250
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,620
 been feeling God, per se, or what would you say

251
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,900
 if my spiritual life has seemed to be going through

252
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,340
 like a drought, or like when I read the Bible,

253
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,100
 like at one point, it was so like, man, everything.

254
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,540
 I just couldn't get enough.

255
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,940
 And when I've been reading, it's just like, man,

256
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,660
 I'm getting nothing from this.

257
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,780
 Does that say something about me, about God?

258
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,660
 Like what would you just speak to people walking

259
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,020
 through those seasons?

260
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,820
 - Yeah, that's a great question.

261
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,940
 Let me just say that in the entirety of Scripture,

262
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,940
 it doesn't tell us a lot of what to feel toward God.

263
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,660
 In Matthew 22, he says, "The greatest commandment

264
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,620
 "is love the Lord your God with all your heart."

265
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,140
 That would be the feeling part, soul, mind, and strength.

266
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,140
 Strength is added in the other two Gospels.

267
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,940
 And so I'm gonna answer that question in what to do

268
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,500
 if you're there, if that's okay.

269
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,260
 And I think of three words,

270
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,720
 obedience, discipline, and emotion.

271
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,720
 And so in terms of obedience, in 1 John 5:3,

272
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,940
 he says, "This is what it means to love God."

273
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,380
 So we're like, okay, lean in,

274
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,260
 'cause I don't feel love for God.

275
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,180
 What does it mean to love God?

276
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,260
 He says, "Obey his commands."

277
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,360
 And so, okay, so if I don't feel close to God,

278
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,980
 I don't feel something in return,

279
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,980
 I can still, regardless of how I feel, follow his commands.

280
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,620
 And then in 1 Timothy 4, 7, there's this admonishment,

281
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,020
 this exhortation to discipline ourselves for godliness.

282
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,020
 Now, I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy discipline.

283
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,660
 And whether you're thinking like,

284
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,020
 "Hey, you're grounded," kind of discipline,

285
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,220
 or like in the gym, I don't like working out,

286
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,980
 it's not fun for me, I don't like to eat right or diet,

287
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,820
 but I do those things because of what they will produce

288
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,180
 in my life, and he says, "What I see that verse as

289
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,140
 "is it gives me permission to not have to enjoy it,

290
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,220
 "but to trust in what it produces in my life."

291
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,180
 So I'm gonna discipline, and this is where,

292
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,620
 I think, as a generation, not to stereotype you or us,

293
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,140
 but we miss it because we're like,

294
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,680
 "Well, if it's hard, it must be wrong."

295
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,740
 No, man, some things are just hard,

296
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,660
 and they're really, really right.

297
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,020
 And so to read the scripture in the morning,

298
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,660
 I'm gonna, real confession between you and I,

299
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,820
 I don't tell anyone, I don't enjoy reading the Bible.

300
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,740
 I know.

301
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,820
 (congregation laughing)

302
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,380
 Gas, audible gas.

303
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,460
 - Across the crowd.

304
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,060
 - I do it every single day of my life

305
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,620
 because of what it produces in my life,

306
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,220
 but I don't enjoy it, and in a way,

307
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,740
 I feel permission not to enjoy it

308
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,980
 because of 1 Timothy 4, 7,

309
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,180
 discipline yourself for godliness.

310
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,700
 And then I called my friend, Shane Bernard's wife,

311
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,380
 Bethany Dillon, Bethany Bernard,

312
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,300
 and she just released an album called All My Questions.

313
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,940
 That album is essentially a lament

314
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,940
 from when her dad died about 15 months ago,

315
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,020
 and she's crying out to God, and she's saying things like,

316
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,300
 "Who else do I have to blame but you?"

317
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,140
 God.

318
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,020
 "Who else do I have?"

319
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,420
 And so she doesn't feel love for God,

320
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,740
 and I said, "What do you do when you're in that pit?"

321
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,580
 And she says, "Remember," I thought this was brilliant,

322
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,460
 she said, "Remember that he's the God of our emotions."

323
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,980
 And so we have to be careful of telling ourselves

324
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,620
 that we should feel something different

325
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,060
 because if we feel something, we can say,

326
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,140
 "Okay, God, why do I feel this?

327
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,060
 "How long is it okay for me to stay here?

328
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,860
 "What is the way out?"

329
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,700
 And just to ask him,

330
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,980
 "Hey, God, you're the God of my emotions.

331
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,820
 "Will you change them?

332
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,780
 "Will you give me joy?"

333
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,860
 The most joyful person I know,

334
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,700
 the most joyful person that I've ever met

335
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,540
 on the planet Earth, her father killed himself

336
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,420
 when she was a child.

337
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,580
 She was bitter.

338
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,380
 She lived by herself at the age of 16.

339
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,620
 Lots of terrible things happened to her,

340
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,100
 but she said, "In the midst of that bitterness,

341
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,420
 "I just prayed that God would give me joy.

342
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,960
 "I just prayed that God would give me joy,

343
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,540
 "and now I sit in that prayer answered."

344
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,520
 And the last thing I'll say on this

345
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,620
 is you have to know what makes you love God more

346
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,540
 or enjoy God more.

347
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,020
 And if that's reading the Bible

348
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,620
 and listening to worship music, great.

349
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,940
 For me, it's a walk in the forest.

350
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,900
 It's listening to really talented, well-produced music.

351
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,860
 It's a bubble bath, okay, don't judge me, right?

352
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,180
 Don't judge me.

353
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,820
 But that's what it is for me.

354
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,860
 You have to know what it is for you,

355
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,820
 and you need to do that more.

356
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,420
 And know what distracts you from God and stop doing that.

357
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,340
 - That's good.

358
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,180
 - Can I add one thing?

359
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,020
 - Yeah.

360
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,860
 - So good.

361
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,420
 I think one of the things that he hit on

362
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,800
 is to know if you're in that season

363
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,620
 where things feel stale or dry,

364
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,560
 to know you're not alone.

365
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,880
 The Bible doesn't get enough credit

366
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,220
 for being incredibly honest.

367
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,620
 You see David crying out, "Where are you, God?"

368
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,460
 In Psalm 13.

369
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,680
 You see him all throughout the psalms saying,

370
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,340
 "God, why have you forsaken me, turned me away?"

371
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,180
 You're not alone.

372
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,500
 And then the other thing, just to add on to what he said,

373
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,420
 is sometimes it's helpful in those seasons

374
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,260
 when I don't feel God, when I go to God's word,

375
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,780
 I'm reminded of how God feels towards me in that season.

376
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,820
 So even when I don't know how I feel,

377
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,420
 I can go to God's word and read how God over and over

378
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,460
 feels towards me, a love that never changes,

379
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,620
 which in that season that all of us can go through,

380
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,660
 all those times, going back to his word

381
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,500
 and being reminded of what is true.

382
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,740
 - That's good.

383
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,960
 - Oh, wait, one more dead guy.

384
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,460
 St. John of the Cross, he was a Spanish priest

385
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,860
 in the 1500s, and he wrote something that changed my life,

386
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,340
 and I wish we heard about this more.

387
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,420
 It is called "Dark Night of the Soul,"

388
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,880
 and it talks about seasons where we feel

389
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,800
 so distant from God, and it put to words

390
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,100
 what I have gone through multiple times in my life,

391
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,020
 and I bet many of you have gone through.

392
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,420
 And there are times that it feels like God

393
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,760
 actually is weaning us off of our emotions.

394
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,320
 And St. John of the Cross says,

395
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,300
 "Do not despise those seasons.

396
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,460
 "Those are gifts from God, so that we aren't

397
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,940
 "emotionally riding waves, that we actually

398
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,180
 "can be faithful no matter what we feel."

399
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,380
 And so when you are in that season,

400
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,420
 just to recognize it as a gift,

401
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,620
 to say this is a time where, like JP said,

402
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,060
 John Bob said, that this is a time.

403
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,900
 Flows, it's gonna work, I feel it, it's about to take off.

404
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,220
 That there are seasons that our discipline

405
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,600
 needs to ramp up, and the way that that happens,

406
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,580
 oftentimes, is our emotions go down,

407
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,900
 and so to not resent it.

408
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,820
 - That's really good.

409
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,140
 All right, well, stay on you, Miss Jenny Faith.

410
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,760
 When I look at you guys, and I see all you're doing,

411
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,140
 I'm sure most people in this room follow you

412
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,500
 on social media, and just also just wanna say

413
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,820
 on behalf of everyone here, thank y'all.

414
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,300
 In the midst of a really dark world,

415
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,280
 thank y'all for using your platforms,

416
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,900
 and your influence to point people to Jesus.

417
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,420
 And I know myself, it's just been such a resource,

418
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,220
 and I've been able to help a lot of people as well.

419
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,840
 But it's easy, I think, for us as young leaders

420
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,620
 to look at you guys and go, man,

421
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,180
 y'all are doing really big things for God,

422
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,940
 and I am so on fire for Jesus,

423
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,460
 and I too wanna be used by God in big ways.

424
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,740
 I wanna be the David and Goliath story.

425
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,380
 I want that kind of, I wanna do big things for God.

426
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,580
 And so, first off, I wanna ask,

427
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,100
 it's kind of a two-part question, but is it wrong

428
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,300
 to influence is weird, and stages and platform,

429
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,780
 especially when you're talking about humility

430
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,500
 and all the different things,

431
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,020
 is it wrong to wanna do big things for God?

432
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,300
 - I think my first question would be why.

433
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,940
 And if the answer to that why

434
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,780
 is to build the kingdom of God, I mean, here's the thing.

435
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,140
 There is an addiction right now to being known,

436
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,000
 to being famous.

437
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,620
 There is an addiction right now to likes,

438
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,740
 and to followers, and to attention.

439
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,700
 And I'm not just saying there's an addiction,

440
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,020
 like there's an addiction to pornography.

441
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,380
 I mean, this is just as dangerous.

442
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,380
 Like, it is absolutely taking hostage our minds,

443
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,980
 our time, our thoughts, the decisions we make.

444
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,260
 So we've got to treat it similarly in the sense

445
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,260
 that there are really only two ways for this to go,

446
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,600
 that you get it, and I'll just tell you right now,

447
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,180
 there is nothing in the most incredible moments

448
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,620
 that I've had in ministry that the world would say,

449
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,180
 oh my gosh, you hit New York Times,

450
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,780
 you did all these awesome things,

451
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,780
 you got to speak at all these awesome events.

452
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,980
 There's not one of those moments that I got off the stage,

453
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,020
 got the award, got the thing that you think,

454
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,620
 okay, that would be the pinnacle,

455
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,020
 and thought, wow, that really filled my soul.

456
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,480
 Like, not one of those moments has ever done that.

457
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,960
 So therefore, let me just take that off the table.

458
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,140
 If it's not gonna fill your soul, why are you chasing it?

459
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,700
 What is in it for you?

460
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,540
 And so if you can just realize

461
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,500
 that it's not going to do the thing that you think it will,

462
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 and then seek ye first the kingdom of God,

463
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,660
 and all these other things will be added to you,

464
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,420
 what he means is your soul will be filled,

465
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,580
 and you'll actually do the works

466
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,820
 that I've called you to do on earth,

467
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,140
 and that is prepared for you in advance.

468
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,620
 So I honestly wouldn't have picked this.

469
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,240
 I know a lot of people would have,

470
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,680
 but you can ask my husband, he's here.

471
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,680
 Even last night, I'm just kind of in a fragile state,

472
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,780
 and I think a lot of us are.

473
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,700
 And I sat on a chair last night, and I cried,

474
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,140
 and I just said, and again, no offense to you guys,

475
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,640
 y'all are great, I can't wait to be here with you.

476
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,500
 (audience laughing)

477
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 But it's still hard to lead right now,

478
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,560
 so don't wish for it, don't wish for it.

479
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,280
 It's a heavy load.

480
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,240
 Now, that is not to say we're all up here

481
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
 being martyrs for Jesus.

482
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,680
 That is to say, to whom much is given, much is expected.

483
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,560
 So unless you're willing to live the expected part,

484
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,040
 don't wish for all the people to lead.

485
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,320
 Now, I will say this.

486
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,480
 Having ambition for the kingdom of God

487
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,200
 to grow in your generation, go for it.

488
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,300
 - Yeah.

489
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,200
 - If that's your why, if your why is,

490
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,220
 this is a short life, heaven is coming,

491
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,960
 and I just want as many people to know him as possible,

492
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
 go for it.

493
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,760
 Will you have mixed motives?

494
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,080
 You will.

495
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,000
 And don't wait for your motives to get all right.

496
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,400
 It won't ever happen.

497
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,120
 Go help people love Jesus.

498
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,160
 God's so good at purifying motives,

499
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,920
 because as we're going, you know, people ask all the time,

500
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,560
 how do you stay humble?

501
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
 And it's a few answers.

502
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,720
 One is my children.

503
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,320
 They are just absolutely unimpressed by me every day.

504
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,160
 Every day.

505
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,240
 And then number two is suffering.

506
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,160
 And that has seemed to go hand in hand

507
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,280
 with leadership for me.

508
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,880
 And it seemed to go hand in hand with leadership for Jesus.

509
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,160
 It seemed to go hand in hand with all the disciples as well.

510
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,040
 And so I do think that there is this idea

511
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,600
 that if I can have all of this,

512
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,400
 then somehow my life will matter.

513
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,520
 Let me just tell you, the small matters.

514
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,560
 The small is changing the world.

515
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,240
 I mean, those of us that are on stages realize

516
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,660
 that we're giving a talk and you go home

517
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,880
 and maybe your life changes and maybe it doesn't.

518
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,680
 But if you're making disciples in your living room,

519
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,320
 if there are people that love God because of you

520
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,120
 and you know their names and you know their stories

521
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,120
 and they've repented of sin to you,

522
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,800
 guys, that is where it is at.

523
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,080
 Do not be confused.

524
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,920
 That is where it is at.

525
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,840
 And so I think those of us that are up on stages,

526
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,540
 I mean, I'd be curious what y'all would add.

527
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,360
 There's this constant thing in my head

528
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,200
 of who am I actually discipling?

529
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,880
 Who are the names and the people

530
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,320
 that I'm actually pouring into?

531
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,040
 - Yeah, I think the thing that she said

532
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,760
 right there out the gate, I don't want you to miss,

533
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,440
 motive matters.

534
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,020
 And everybody thinks I wanna be rich

535
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,360
 so that I can give it all away, okay?

536
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
 I hear that all the time.

537
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,240
 I want God to give me a lot of money

538
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,520
 so that I can give it away.

539
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,080
 Well, then you wanna be poor

540
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,200
 because if you had a lot of money

541
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
 and you gave it all away, you'd be poor.

542
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,440
 So it's really a desire to be poor.

543
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,480
 And that's where you started,

544
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,200
 so you might as well just stay there, right?

545
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,560
 (laughing)

546
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,700
 And so you think, man, I want a big platform

547
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,120
 so that I can point others to Jesus.

548
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,220
 But the problem, and then it gets really messy in your head

549
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,880
 because if more people follow me,

550
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,280
 then I can point them to Jesus.

551
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,520
 Now I want them to follow me.

552
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,100
 Now I just want them to follow me.

553
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,520
 Now I'm an addict of that.

554
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,120
 And that is where the enemy works the most.

555
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,680
 Everybody's seen somebody climb the ladder only to fall.

556
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,180
 And so then you're running scared,

557
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,800
 and then you feel a unique attack,

558
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,440
 and then you have the trolls on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook

559
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,600
 that you're like, I'm just trying to make much of Jesus.

560
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,840
 And they're like, no, you're not.

561
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,400
 You're a sellout, you know, whatever,

562
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,720
 your shoes, blah, blah, blah.

563
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,600
 And so, and you just, and you wake up,

564
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,680
 and you're like, okay, you know,

565
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,220
 how do I just make much of Jesus?

566
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,880
 So don't worship people, pray for them, okay?

567
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,040
 Don't worship people, pray for them,

568
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,800
 and know that, know your why, is what she said,

569
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,060
 and I would just repeat that with the exclamation point.

570
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,900
 - That's good.

571
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,080
 I don't think I'd add any,

572
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,800
 I think one thing she said at the end there

573
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,600
 about suffering, and that someone once said,

574
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,720
 I think it was Swindoll, who said,

575
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,440
 oftentimes for God to use someone greatly,

576
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,560
 he first wounds them deeply.

577
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,320
 And that some of you guys may be in a season

578
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,180
 where you're experiencing that,

579
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,640
 or you have experienced that,

580
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,920
 and to not neglect, not just the days of small beginnings,

581
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,080
 but those moments where God is shaping and forming you,

582
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,200
 and writing a story that he's gonna use

583
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,480
 the way he comforts you to comfort others

584
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,840
 with the comfort you've received in Christ,

585
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,760
 and that each of us has, like she said,

586
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,120
 like Instagram's not real.

587
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,400
 Twitter, it's not real.

588
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,760
 Facebook, it's not real.

589
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,640
 What's real is relationships and people around you,

590
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,560
 and stewarding those, and pointing people

591
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,700
 on a day-by-day basis to Christ.

592
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,080
 - That's good.

593
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,480
 David, just staying on you.

594
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,960
 So one of my next questions is when you look at this,

595
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,760
 and like you experience a weekend like this,

596
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,360
 I think a lot of people, most people are not from Texas,

597
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,920
 and they don't have access to something like this

598
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,840
 with like-minded people their age,

599
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,520
 back in their states, back in their cities.

600
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,080
 And yes, this is fun, but they do know it's ending,

601
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,960
 and they're going back to something really hard,

602
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,100
 or really lonely.

603
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,040
 They watch the porch online because they're like,

604
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,080
 I just, I can't find a thriving young adult ministry.

605
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,920
 To that person that feels kind of alone in the fight,

606
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,560
 alone in the day-to-day, like how would you encourage them,

607
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,600
 and like what is a practical step that they can take

608
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,920
 to start to experience more like,

609
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,960
 you said everything matters

610
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,100
 within the context of relationships.

611
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,800
 Like how can they take best steps towards that?

612
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,820
 - Yeah, I'll say two things.

613
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,720
 One is really practical, and the second one is like

614
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,240
 attention that I personally feel in conferences like this.

615
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,560
 First one is practically, if you wanna start

616
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,440
 a Porch Live location, people ask us all the time,

617
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,080
 will you bring one to Nashville, bring one to LA,

618
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,280
 bring one to different cities.

619
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,960
 The way those start, we have never been calling,

620
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,640
 or those have always been reactionary, almost entirely,

621
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,220
 where somebody raises up, or God raises up a leader

622
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,240
 in a city, says hey, I have a heart for reaching people

623
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,640
 in my city, and I wanna see what is happening

624
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,800
 at the porch happen here,

625
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,440
 and they start a Porch Live location.

626
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,480
 So if you wanna start one, we will help you,

627
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,800
 we will give you resources.

628
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,380
 We have someone on our, Josiah Jones on our team

629
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,200
 who's an amazing communicator, is,

630
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,920
 huge part of his job is to help raise up

631
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,840
 and help equip churches that want to partner with us

632
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,000
 in that, so you can bring it to your city, near you.

633
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,440
 The second thing I feel is when you walk away

634
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,200
 from conferences like this, what makes or breaks

635
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,880
 a conference is not all of the amazing lights

636
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,340
 and all the stuff that you see here.

637
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,120
 That's awesome, that's super cool,

638
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,580
 the different techno bands that were making people

639
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,460
 trip out last night were amazing.

640
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,080
 But they don't change lives.

641
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,040
 What changes lives is the spirit of God

642
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,740
 and the word of God, and the reason I say

643
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,880
 it's a tension I feel is I don't want people

644
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,300
 to leave here going, man, that was incredible.

645
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,520
 If only we could have a huge DJ out there

646
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,960
 on a Fork scissor lift, then God could really

647
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,080
 do something amazing in my city.

648
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,840
 That's not how God does something amazing in your city.

649
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,640
 People coming together and teaching the word

650
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,160
 and gathering in small groups,

651
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,280
 living authentically in relationships,

652
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,640
 and that ripple begins to spread,

653
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,620
 and you can do that with three people.

654
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,740
 You can do that with two people,

655
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,440
 and that's how God is ultimately gonna bring

656
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,640
 about revival and awaken.

657
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,080
 You don't need a big stage, you don't need a big light,

658
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,720
 or big lights, but you do need to be anchored

659
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,020
 to the word of God and run with other people authentically

660
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,560
 and help one another, partner together.

661
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,800
 I'd be intrigued to know what y'all would say.

662
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,960
 - No, I would say start a porch,

663
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,800
 I go back to where you started,

664
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,360
 start a porch in your town,

665
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,500
 and you don't necessarily need a porch

666
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,780
 if you have something, an alternative there,

667
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,080
 but if you don't, I know your team has done

668
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,240
 the most incredible job I've ever seen

669
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,900
 of just saying, hey, how can we come around you

670
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,900
 and help you, because their heart is not just

671
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,520
 for what God is doing right here in Dallas, Texas,

672
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,460
 their heart is to see an entire generation

673
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,060
 reached for Jesus, and they're saying,

674
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,760
 hey, what can we do to make that happen,

675
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,460
 and I couldn't be more encouraged

676
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,140
 by what God is doing in and through this place.

677
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,300
 - That's awesome.

678
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,220
 I'm gonna kind of go off script.

679
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,660
 JP, I'm gonna start with you,

680
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,580
 and then Amy can speak to it,

681
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,640
 'cause I've recently seen this on your Instagram stories,

682
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,200
 and your posts recently.

683
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,760
 You've been reposting a post about the end times.

684
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,600
 - Okay.

685
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,480
 - And it doesn't look like a good end times conversation.

686
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,760
 (laughing)

687
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,960
 But I think it would just be kind of weird

688
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,320
 to not discuss all the events going on in our world today.

689
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,360
 I know, Jenny, you've been helping a lot

690
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,200
 with going on in Afghanistan, and just different things,

691
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,680
 and we've been just praying and praying here at the porch,

692
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,060
 and so I think a question people are asking

693
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,180
 is with all of it going on,

694
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,180
 is it pointing to Jesus's return,

695
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,520
 or is it pointing to God's silence?

696
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,020
 Like, what is it, and do you believe

697
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,300
 that we are in that time?

698
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,100
 Like, how do I, I guess people would just simply ask him,

699
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,540
 like, are we in the end times?

700
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,500
 'Cause people have been asking for a long time.

701
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,740
 - Yeah, I would just say, without a,

702
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,380
 make sure you hear the second part of this answer.

703
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,480
 I would say, without a doubt in my mind,

704
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,040
 it's pointing to the return of Jesus.

705
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,840
 And without a doubt on my mind,

706
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,120
 it is pointing to the judgment of God

707
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,480
 as we move from his heart, if you will.

708
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,000
 And that's a pretty safe answer,

709
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,800
 because I know every 24-hour period that passes,

710
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,960
 we're closer to the return of Christ.

711
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,360
 And I know that the further that we move

712
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,800
 from the heart of God, the more that we will experience

713
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,340
 judgment from God, right?

714
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,440
 And so I don't know that anyone's going to look

715
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,680
 at our land right now and say, man, they're really,

716
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,680
 you know, they're really by and large moving toward God.

717
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,920
 And then what I would say is I'm,

718
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,260
 and this is what you have to hear me, is I'm so hopeful.

719
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,420
 Like, you flew in, you purchased tickets, you got here.

720
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,920
 You wanted to spend Labor Day weekend very different

721
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,700
 than I wanted to spend Labor Day weekend

722
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,840
 when I was your age.

723
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,540
 And what that does is that strengthens my heart,

724
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,840
 strengthens my conviction.

725
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,840
 And I would just say to go back on topic,

726
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,800
 it doesn't matter.

727
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 It doesn't matter.

728
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,920
 Like, Martin Luther's been misquoted as saying,

729
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,720
 if I knew Jesus was coming back tomorrow,

730
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,540
 you know, what would you do?

731
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,380
 I'd plant a tree.

732
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,780
 And I don't think he actually said that.

733
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,380
 But I do think it captures this idea

734
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,060
 of if we knew that Jesus was coming back tomorrow,

735
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,960
 we should live today like we know he's coming back tomorrow.

736
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,620
 We should do everything today as though the cloud,

737
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,320
 the sky is gonna crack open and there's the white horse

738
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,360
 and the robe dipped in blood,

739
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,960
 king of king, Lord of lords on his thigh.

740
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,520
 Like, there he is, you know.

741
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,760
 And whatever we would do today,

742
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,320
 if we knew that was gonna happen tomorrow,

743
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,560
 we should do today.

744
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,560
 - That's good, that's good.

745
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,000
 - I talked to my team about this

746
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,400
 and in the midst of COVID and coming back in.

747
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,600
 And I think what we realize is in this next season,

748
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,080
 you know, I've been doing this about eight years publicly.

749
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,120
 And if, you know, if we have eight more years

750
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,720
 or 10 more years, I just said this next season,

751
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,680
 I think what we're gonna see is that our motives

752
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,360
 do get purified because it's going to be

753
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,320
 a little bit harder than it's ever been.

754
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,300
 And I expect that.

755
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,560
 And we need to be more focused than ever

756
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,240
 in training your generation and younger

757
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,720
 to persevere no matter what

758
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,360
 and to expect Jesus to come back.

759
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,880
 And the reason I said that is because

760
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,360
 there's a fervor that I see.

761
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,280
 When I speak in front of Gen Z right now,

762
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,120
 there is a fervor.

763
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,200
 How many of y'all are Gen Z?

764
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,040
 Consider yourself.

765
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,720
 Okay, good, good.

766
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,380
 So there's a fervor.

767
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,480
 - Forget about it.

768
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,180
 - There's a fervor that I see in you and your generation

769
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,180
 that I have never felt in my short tenure in ministry.

770
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,180
 And it has us so excited.

771
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,280
 And there's this sense of if you guys

772
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,520
 are actually believing this book,

773
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,440
 like Jefferson just told the story of Scripture

774
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,040
 and you align yourself with that narrative,

775
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,840
 if you actually live that,

776
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,280
 at least we won't be the reason Jesus didn't come back.

777
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,560
 Like we will be living in such a way as a generation.

778
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,040
 And I'm an optimist, but I can see it.

779
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,240
 I can see the church, not the world,

780
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,380
 the church purified, actually living this book,

781
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,840
 believing this book, loving people,

782
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,280
 believing in the Holy Spirit,

783
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,360
 filled with the Holy Spirit, preaching the word.

784
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,160
 Y'all, I see it happening in this generation.

785
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,200
 It's already happening.

786
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,840
 The number of people, Gen Z, coming up to me and saying,

787
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,900
 "You know what?

788
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,440
 "I think I'm called to go on the mission field.

789
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,560
 "I think I'm called to go into ministry."

790
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,520
 Y'all, that didn't happen as much with millennials.

791
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,200
 Sorry, it just didn't.

792
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,060
 Gen Z seems to be rising up and saying,

793
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,280
 "Okay, we need to get serious about this book."

794
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,800
 So if that is because Jesus is coming back, awesome.

795
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,180
 But what if it's Gen Z's kids or kids' kids?

796
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,120
 We still need a generation to rise up

797
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,520
 and to be that serious about the gospel

798
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,160
 and that serious about the Bible.

799
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
 - That's good.

800
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,480
 - I hope so.

801
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,560
 And honestly, I think they missed the answer

802
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,400
 'cause even Jesus said, "I don't know the time

803
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,040
 "nor the place, only the Father knows."

804
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
 So both of these guys were off in saying that,

805
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,640
 but I'm totally kidding.

806
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,560
 - This guy's job's so easy, just in the class.

807
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,400
 (laughing)

808
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,000
 - They get it, David James, quote the Bible.

809
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,040
 - I mean, it's tried,

810
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,680
 but I think everything they said is spot on, that we are.

811
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,080
 I mean, from the moment Jesus left, we're in the end times,

812
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,360
 and I really hope so.

813
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,900
 - Yeah, that's good.

814
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,640
 All right, I wanna give each of you an opportunity

815
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,840
 to answer this next question

816
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,340
 'cause I think it's just such a good one to ask.

817
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,960
 I really enjoy it every time I hear it in a panel.

818
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,960
 Just, man, if whatever's just passionate on your mind,

819
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,920
 on your heart for this generation, for us,

820
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,820
 for this room specifically,

821
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,080
 like if there was, if Jesus was coming back tomorrow

822
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,240
 and there was one message, one just encouraging thing

823
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,520
 or challenge or anything like that

824
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,880
 that you would share with us, what would it be?

825
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,560
 - I'll go first.

826
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,800
 (laughing)

827
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,480
 I hope you leave this weekend

828
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,200
 with an overinflated understanding

829
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,080
 of how important you as the body of Christ are to our world.

830
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,440
 Jesus would say that you are salt and light

831
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
 in a world of darkness.

832
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,560
 And the reason I say overflated

833
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,780
 is because it would be impossible for me to communicate

834
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,480
 in a way that could actually inflate

835
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,280
 to the degree of importance that you are in the world.

836
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,180
 That Jesus, when he said salt, what was salt?

837
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,920
 In the first century, it was a preservative.

838
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,440
 In other words, there was no refrigeration.

839
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,520
 They would use salt to preserve food

840
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
 in order to allow it to last longer.

841
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,760
 Jesus is saying the church in the world

842
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,840
 is the thing that will slow the decay

843
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,780
 and the brokenness and the rot that sin is bringing about.

844
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,600
 And that exists in apartments that are represented here,

845
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,000
 in colleges represented here,

846
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,640
 that you are the preservative

847
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,840
 of the school you're a part of,

848
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,080
 of the company you work for, of the city that you live in.

849
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,120
 It would be impossible to understate how important,

850
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,720
 and not in a self-glorifying way,

851
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,880
 in a way that you are the means by which God is saying,

852
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,720
 I'm gonna bring light into darkness.

853
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,320
 I'm gonna bring, I'm gonna slow down death, decay,

854
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,640
 all the things that are just of the natural order

855
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,200
 in this world and produce the fruits of the spirit

856
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,200
 that are not natural, of love and joy and peace,

857
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
 patience, gentleness, kindness.

858
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,660
 And so as you go and holding onto this book,

859
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,560
 the importance and opportunity that you have,

860
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,280
 not on your own strength, but by depending on the spirit

861
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,880
 and living according to this book,

862
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,260
 it would be impossible for me to overstate that.

863
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,640
 And you don't feel that, and you may not even sense that,

864
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,360
 but Jesus would say, and I'm about to be done,

865
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,540
 pass the mic, Jesus would say,

866
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,520
 in that really dark company,

867
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,840
 where there's no other believers but you,

868
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,160
 in that city where you feel like, man,

869
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,560
 nobody dates like they talk on the porch,

870
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,520
 he would say, I have a light in the darkness.

871
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,980
 I have got salt, because he's got you.

872
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,920
 I got boots on the ground there.

873
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,680
 I have my people there.

874
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,500
 And he's got them all over this country

875
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,700
 and all over the world.

876
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,860
 You matter.

877
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,180
 And for the future of the church

878
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,600
 and the future of what God is gonna do through the church,

879
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,480
 you matter, not because of how special you are,

880
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,860
 but by surrendering and walking with him,

881
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,320
 it would be impossible to understand fully how much

882
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,780
 and how important you are, 'cause you're part of the church.

883
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,440
 So, we'll do what I say. - That's really good.

884
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,440
 - Yeah, that's a word. (audience applauding)

885
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,820
 - This is the least drop the mic thing ever,

886
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,240
 but it matters so much.

887
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,520
 You need to belong to a local church.

888
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,040
 You need to submit to someone in your life.

889
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,840
 - It's the greatest thing, the mic.

890
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,840
 - You need to be a person who knows,

891
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,960
 these are the three, four, five people

892
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,920
 who can put me in my place.

893
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,640
 Submission, local church, knowing this book,

894
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,640
 these are the ways that God has moved throughout history,

895
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,920
 and it's not gonna take a detour come 2021.

896
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
 Like, this is how it's still going to happen,

897
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,040
 and yet I see a generation coming that's zealous,

898
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,080
 but they're not submitted to the word of God,

899
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,500
 they're not submitted to elders in a local church.

900
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,400
 It is not fun.

901
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,580
 I was with a bunch of leaders recently,

902
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,880
 and we were talking about this,

903
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,520
 and they were asking me why I didn't do something,

904
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,440
 and I said, "I don't know what my local elders

905
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,560
 "would say about it."

906
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,400
 And this was, do I have permission?

907
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,040
 It was eat meat, don't eat meat, that kind of thing,

908
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,200
 except you all know it wasn't that.

909
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,160
 So, you're all going, what was it?

910
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,400
 (laughing)

911
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,440
 And I said, you know, I don't know,

912
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,840
 I would need to check with my local elders.

913
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,800
 This is very famous, very well-known leaders

914
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,640
 that I'm sitting with.

915
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,000
 All of them looked at me like I had said something

916
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,300
 absolutely insane.

917
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,640
 And they all started asking me,

918
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,000
 what do you mean, your local elders?

919
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 What do you mean you take things to them,

920
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 you ask them questions?

921
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,160
 I'm like, I know where they stand on things,

922
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,560
 and I submit to that.

923
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,980
 And I would say that is something that we are afraid of,

924
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,340
 but it is something that I have seen God bless

925
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,640
 over and over and over again in my life.

926
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,080
 My word about submission, my husband is sitting over here.

927
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,520
 He is a really strong man who is married

928
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,080
 to a really strong woman, but at the end of the day,

929
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,200
 that man knows that if I'm not sitting up here

930
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,520
 of my own accord, I'm sitting up here with his blessing.

931
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,440
 He sent me here.

932
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,240
 And that submission, and some of you are not

933
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,080
 under the authority of your husband,

934
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,040
 but you've gotta be under the authority of someone.

935
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,000
 All of us, all of us have gotta be

936
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,260
 under the authority of someone.

937
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,920
 And so, I would say, submission is this to me.

938
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,080
 Submission is protection, it's protection.

939
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,400
 And I'll get to get to heaven, and God will say,

940
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,480
 now, Jenny, why did you not do this, or why?

941
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,320
 And I'm like, blame the man.

942
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,320
 (audience laughing)

943
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,360
 Awesome, love submission.

944
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:39,640
 And I would say, that man, you know what his goal is?

945
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,480
 My motives might be mixed on a given day,

946
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,280
 but that man looks at me in the eyes and says,

947
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,640
 tomorrow, you know what he said last night when I was tired?

948
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,240
 He said, Jenny, tomorrow, you're gonna get up

949
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,800
 and go build the kingdom of God.

950
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,560
 And that is, that is submission.

951
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,520
 It's sending, it's protecting.

952
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,860
 And local church, guys, what David just talked about,

953
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,800
 that idea comes from Corinthians,

954
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,080
 where it's talking about a local body,

955
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,040
 the hands, the feet, all of the parts of the body,

956
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,520
 and it's expressed not in the global church.

957
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,260
 Y'all, anything I do for the global church

958
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,360
 has come out of this local church.

959
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,680
 This is my home church.

960
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,840
 It's come out of people that I'm discipling

961
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,660
 in my living room.

962
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,800
 It's come out of convictions that I've built

963
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,680
 because I sit under the teaching of the elders

964
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,040
 and the teachers of this body.

965
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,080
 And I think we've got to value being under and covered more.

966
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,320
 And when you are, God can send you further

967
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,280
 because he knows, okay, there's somebody

968
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,760
 that can grab that girl by the collar,

969
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,320
 which often happens to me.

970
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
 You've done it to me.

971
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,920
 You've grabbed, yeah, yeah.

972
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,000
 (laughing)

973
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,200
 - Here's what I would, I love you.

974
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,360
 You're like, this is gonna be the least

975
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,580
 mic drop moment ever.

976
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,080
 And then you're like, drop the mic.

977
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,320
 (laughing)

978
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,620
 I'll say what I was going to say really quickly

979
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,900
 in a second just to say, I know that there's mostly

980
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,980
 ladies here, so I'm just like looking out

981
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,640
 and saying that slightly.

982
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,640
 And I have never wondered why God has grown

983
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,900
 Jenny's platform because everything she just said,

984
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,300
 she lives, and her and Zach are both mentors of mine.

985
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,700
 I mean, they're both people that I call immediately

986
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,780
 when I'm like, I don't know what to do, help me.

987
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:28,580
 And she leads with a limp, meaning it's out

988
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,700
 of her fragility, it's out of, hey, I can't,

989
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,980
 but God, you can, if you will.

990
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,660
 And she means everything she just said

991
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,820
 and to the men in the room that Hebrews 13, 17,

992
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,500
 you know, that come under the church's leadership,

993
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,900
 like find a healthy church and submit yourself

994
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,380
 to them, which we don't like to do.

995
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,340
 Like, that's an amazing application for everyone here,

996
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,560
 that if just that knob turned, if you go back

997
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,780
 to your respective cities, you find a healthy

998
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,940
 Bible teaching church, and you say, okay,

999
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,040
 I want to be a member here and stay here,

1000
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,260
 belong here, give here, serve here,

1001
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,940
 the world would change.

1002
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,860
 My answer was gonna be Matthew 6, 33,

1003
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,020
 which you said earlier, you know,

1004
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,540
 which is just seek first his kingdom

1005
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,280
 and his righteousness and trust him for everything else.

1006
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,340
 That's one of two of my life verses,

1007
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,980
 God, help me seek first your kingdom

1008
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,820
 and your righteousness and trust you in all the details.

1009
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,020
 - That's good, man.

1010
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,180
 I just wanna thank y'all for that, seriously.

1011
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,680
 (congregation applauding)

1012
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,300
 We do have a few more minutes, so why not?

1013
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,280
 I have like a bunch more questions,

1014
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,740
 but David, you kind of talked about this yesterday,

1015
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,180
 the idea of like who you follow and who you listen to

1016
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,220
 in regards to truth matter.

1017
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,580
 And we are like the smartphone in our pocket,

1018
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,020
 information at our fingertip generation.

1019
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,140
 And because of that, it can almost come to our detriment.

1020
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:00,040
 There is so much constant content coming out in front of us

1021
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,040
 and it can be really easy to fall under leadership

1022
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,940
 that may not be best for us or just not to know.

1023
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:13,180
 So when looking at all these pastors,

1024
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,660
 when looking at all these resources,

1025
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,340
 all these, I mean, just all these books being written,

1026
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,740
 how can I know who to follow and who to trust?

1027
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,440
 Like what voice to trust today?

1028
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,280
 - Let me take it.

1029
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,100
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1030
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,740
 I'm gonna try to go quick on this.

1031
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,140
 So recently I've had this like weird acid reflux thing.

1032
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,380
 (congregation laughing)

1033
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,420
 40 is awesome.

1034
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,100
 - I got someone.

1035
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,300
 - And so I like, yeah.

1036
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,500
 And so I went to a nutritionist,

1037
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,100
 I paid all this money, drove to Dallas,

1038
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,540
 met with this nutritionist and I'm like,

1039
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,860
 what do you think about the keto diet?

1040
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,900
 What about probiotics?

1041
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,740
 What about this?

1042
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,900
 What about supplements?

1043
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,660
 And essentially, like I left there

1044
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,060
 with eighth grade health class, like just eat well.

1045
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,100
 Like you have four food groups and it was like 101.

1046
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,780
 I'm like, but what's the quick fix?

1047
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,180
 She's like, no, you just need to eat better.

1048
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,980
 And I was like, gosh.

1049
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,980
 And whether you realize it or not, you're hungry.

1050
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,940
 Like there's a hunger inside of you right now.

1051
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,660
 That's why you're here, whether you realize it or not,

1052
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,860
 you're hungry.

1053
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,580
 And I can give you a Snickers bar

1054
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,220
 and that may be even what you're craving.

1055
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,700
 You might be like, I want chocolate or Sour Patch Kids.

1056
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,060
 Like I want the peanut butter M&Ms.

1057
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,260
 That's what I want.

1058
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,820
 But what you need is a square meal.

1059
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,860
 What you need is the four food groups.

1060
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,540
 You need to eat healthy.

1061
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,060
 And the same is true in the way that we digest truth

1062
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:42,060
 is there's people out there, preachers out there

1063
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,860
 that will have these amazing elaborate illustrations

1064
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,980
 and it's a beautiful snack for you.

1065
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,100
 Like that was a neat snack.

1066
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,740
 That was a really cool 15 second TikTok, okay.

1067
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,740
 That's not going to get you through the week, if you will.

1068
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,740
 And so you wanna go somewhere where you learn the Bible.

1069
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,820
 When Jefferson was speaking earlier, that East West thing,

1070
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,180
 I was like, oh, okay, I've got to go back

1071
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,580
 and dive into that.

1072
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,740
 And so that's what it did in me.

1073
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,860
 It's like, okay, God, I can't wait to spend time with you

1074
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,260
 and dive deeper into that,

1075
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,140
 look into that East and West thing and just learn,

1076
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,060
 okay, they went East.

1077
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,180
 Okay, that was rebellion.

1078
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,660
 Wow, I've never thought about that before.

1079
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,380
 And you wanna go somewhere that awakens

1080
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,540
 for that 30, 45 minutes.

1081
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:28,540
 They want you to, you then want to go spend time with God

1082
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,620
 and learn his word.

1083
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,460
 To say that in a simple way,

1084
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,380
 you wanna go somewhere that teaches the Bible.

1085
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,300
 Like find a place.

1086
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,060
 It's okay if they use illustrations to teach the Bible.

1087
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,580
 It's okay if they dress trendy, but they teach the Bible.

1088
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,980
 Like you just wanna go somewhere

1089
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,780
 where you actually learn the Bible.

1090
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,900
 That's what I would say.

1091
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,740
 - That's good.

1092
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,100
 (congregation applauding)

1093
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,180
 I don't think I'd add anything.

1094
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,900
 I think I would run everything that you hear

1095
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,900
 through the lens of scripture.

1096
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,740
 I would take it all.

1097
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,140
 I take everything that you're hearing from us.

1098
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,740
 For whatever reason, we've lost the ability

1099
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,420
 to think in society.

1100
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,260
 Maybe it's just 'cause we've all been,

1101
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,420
 I don't know what the reason is,

1102
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,580
 but to go, hey, everything I hear,

1103
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,980
 I'm gonna take it back to what God's word,

1104
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,660
 everything that I sing, I'm gonna go,

1105
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,260
 hey, is what I'm singing right now,

1106
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,260
 like can I support that with what is in scripture

1107
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,360
 and how would I, what I'm hearing right now?

1108
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,660
 It sounds good.

1109
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,060
 And I think this is why it's so important

1110
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,180
 is there's a lot of things that sound powerful,

1111
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,940
 they're inspirational, they're heart touching,

1112
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,220
 but they're not actually biblical.

1113
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,420
 And so running everything back through God's word

1114
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,900
 and how can I support what they're saying

1115
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,460
 or does that actually come from God's word?

1116
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,660
 That's good.

1117
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,260
 - Do boring things well.

1118
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,300
 And what I mean by that is know this book

1119
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,380
 and get in it just like they were talking about earlier

1120
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,420
 because it is amazing to me how people can post

1121
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,980
 the most ridiculous stuff.

1122
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,020
 And you're so obviously wrong.

1123
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,420
 And then you look at the comments and it's like,

1124
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,820
 amen, amen, you know, everybody agrees.

1125
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,060
 And I'm going, wait, like really,

1126
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,500
 do y'all agree with that?

1127
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,940
 Like, is that where we are today?

1128
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,420
 And it is, and it is.

1129
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,460
 And so the only way to fight that is biblical literacy.

1130
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,460
 We've got to know this book.

1131
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,060
 You cannot depend on me or anybody else

1132
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,940
 to teach you this book.

1133
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,660
 You have to know the book.

1134
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,500
 And then when I am encouraging you

1135
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,180
 in what you already know,

1136
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,380
 it is reminding you that you're not alone,

1137
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,460
 that you're not crazy for believing it.

1138
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,380
 That's what teachers should do,

1139
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,260
 but you personally have got to know it.

1140
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,220
 And I think that idea of biblical literacy

1141
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,860
 is kind of boring and we've just got to do that work.

1142
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,580
 And it was for all of us here.

1143
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,100
 I mean, we've spent years, you know,

1144
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,140
 in the word of God and understanding it.

1145
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,820
 I have huge fat commentaries and notebooks from seminary

1146
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,100
 where I did that work.

1147
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,260
 You don't have to go to seminary,

1148
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,780
 but I would encourage you to get

1149
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,500
 some basic Bible commentaries,

1150
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,180
 to read, you know, "Systematic Theology" by Wayne Grudem,

1151
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,660
 to read the basics so that you know the answers

1152
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,100
 to the big questions in a way

1153
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,620
 that you're not easily led astray.

1154
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,820
 'Cause James talks about the waves, you know, of doubt

1155
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,900
 and that you're being tossed to and fro

1156
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,020
 and we really need to be people

1157
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,220
 that aren't tossed to and fro.

1158
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,340
 - It's like this, I was thinking,

1159
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,180
 I know we got to wrap up.

1160
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,660
 I was thinking about these two this morning and doing this.

1161
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,700
 They each have really distinct communication styles

1162
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,460
 and have spent enormous amounts of time,

1163
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,140
 a good amount of time with both of them.

1164
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,180
 And I feel like I could,

1165
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,060
 if I heard someone say or repeat something,

1166
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,900
 I could be like,

1167
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,940
 "That sounds like something Jenny would say."

1168
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,700
 Or especially with him, like,

1169
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,060
 "Man, that totally, I could hear him saying that."

1170
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,940
 Or, "That sounds like something he would say."

1171
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,660
 I think people, because they don't know the Bible,

1172
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,340
 they're not able to go,

1173
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,540
 "That sounds like something God would say."

1174
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,380
 And they just assume,

1175
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,700
 'cause I heard it from a preacher,

1176
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,780
 "Man, that sounds like something."

1177
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,180
 But they don't know 'cause they don't know the Bible,

1178
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,820
 so they don't have the ability to say,

1179
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,580
 "That sounds like something he would say, God would say."

1180
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,420
 - Yeah.

1181
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,700
 - Okay.

1182
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,820
 Let us know, DeMar.

1183
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,860
 - That's good.

1184
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,860
 - Man.

1185
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,980
 Yeah, let's just thank these guys one more time.

1186
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,480
 (congregation applauding)

1187
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,420
 We love y'all, seriously.

1188
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,220
 And just so thankful to be underneath

1189
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,860
 and submit to y'all's leadership

1190
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,580
 as you seek to submit to the Lord.

1191
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,900
 And so, Jenny, would you mind just praying for us?

1192
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,860
 - Love it.

1193
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,620
 So God, here we are.

1194
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,460
 Here we are.

1195
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,540
 And I think about these days,

1196
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,780
 and what I don't want is that this would be a waste,

1197
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,340
 that it would burn away.

1198
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,780
 But God, your spirit being here,

1199
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,740
 your word being taught, your people being gathered,

1200
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,940
 you promise that it won't be.

1201
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:33,940
 You promise that this will last because you are here.

1202
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,220
 Your word will not return void.

1203
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,500
 So God, would it fall on incredible soil?

1204
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,940
 Would it produce incredible fruit?

1205
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,980
 Because your kingdom is coming,

1206
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,820
 and we would like your will to be done in this generation,

1207
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,300
 on earth as it is in heaven, in Jesus' name, amen.

1208
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,000
 - Amen. - Thank y'all.

1209
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,500
 (congregation applauding)
