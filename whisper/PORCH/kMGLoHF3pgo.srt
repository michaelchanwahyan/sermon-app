1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
 Hey Porch, join me as we read God's word together.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,780
 From the Gospel of Mark, chapter 4, verses 35 through 41.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,460
 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,740
 And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,160
 And other boats were with him.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,200
 And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,540
 was already filling.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,620
 But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion.

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,320
 And they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?"

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,940
 And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace, be still."

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,720
 And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,580
 He said to them, "Why are you so afraid?

13
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,960
 Have you still no faith?"

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,680
 And they were filled with great fear, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,120
 even the wind and the sea obey him?"

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,320
 And now our seventh message in our series called "Disciple."

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,000
 Well, what's up Porch?

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 How we doing tonight?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 All right.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,840
 Hey, I do want to give a quick shout out to everyone watching online tonight.

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,240
 Porch Life Springfield, welcome to the mix.

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,000
 I know you guys are new, getting up and running.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,720
 We got Porch Life Fresno, Porch Life Scottsdale, it's amazing that you guys are jumping in

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,040
 with us.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,440
 Hey, my name's Timothy Atik, I'm one of the pastors here.

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,600
 I am not normally here on Tuesdays, but I love any chance I get to be here.

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,960
 I did not know I was going to be here tonight.

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,200
 I got a call this morning, probably between nine or 10 from Kylan, and he was like, "Hey

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,880
 man, do you remember when you had your child on a Tuesday at breakaway and you needed someone

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
 else to speak?"

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
 I was like, "Yes."

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,200
 He's like, "I need you to do that for me tonight."

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,040
 Because Cash Levi Perry was born today.

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,320
 So I don't know, yeah.

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,880
 I don't know if they've got the live stream on just to introduce Cash to the porch.

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,920
 That'd be a good way to start his first day on this earth.

37
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,080
 But Brooke and Kylan, we are so excited for you guys and can't wait to meet Cash.

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,560
 So that means you get me tonight, and I'm so glad to be here with you on election night.

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,520
 Anytime that I have the chance to teach the Word of God, I love to give people an opportunity

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,840
 just to pray before we do that.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
 So if you join us on Sundays, and if you don't have a home church, please come join us on

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Sundays.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 We'd love to have you.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,520
 But right now I want to invite you to take a second and just pray.

45
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:12,800
 Say, "God, would you speak clearly to me tonight?"

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,680
 And then I want to invite you to pray for the people around you.

47
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:25,360
 Just say, "God, speak clearly to them."

48
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,320
 And then I want to ask you to pray for me.

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,560
 Just say, "God, would you speak clearly through T.A. to us tonight?"

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:40,800
 Well, Lord, I pray that you give us eyes to see you and ears to hear from you.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,440
 God, I pray that our hearts would be receptive to all that you want to say in Jesus' name.

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
 Amen.

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,720
 Hey, so I wasn't planning on being here, as I've already shared.

54
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,640
 And so I'm just going to warn you from now.

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,480
 I am giving a talk I've given at the porch before, about two and a half years ago.

56
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,360
 Some of this might sound familiar to some of you.

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,840
 I'm just OK with that.

58
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,520
 Like I am not under any impression that you remember what I say, what I said two and a

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,440
 half years ago.

60
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,240
 And sometimes a movie is better the second time you see it.

61
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
 OK?

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,160
 So I hope it's an encouragement to you.

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,720
 If some of the stories are familiar, you can just laugh as hard as you did the first round.

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
 All right?

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,280
 And that'll make me feel really good.

66
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,080
 So several years ago, when my two boys—I have three boys now—but when my two oldest

67
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,440
 boys, when they were about two and a half and five months old, I made a very unfortunate

68
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,160
 decision as a dad.

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,560
 And that was to attempt to drive from Austin to Dallas with my two boys, but without my

70
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
 wife.

71
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,080
 Like, I was planning to fly solo just myself.

72
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,560
 So we began to make our way up I-35, and for the first hour of the trip, I was crushing

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,960
 it as a dad, primarily because both kids were asleep.

74
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,640
 And then we got to around the temple area, if you're familiar with that drive up 35,

75
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,880
 and my kids were awake.

76
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,280
 And so I decided that it was time for us to stop off at the Chick-fil-A in Temple to have

77
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
 lunch.

78
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,480
 And so I literally, I pulled into the parking space in the Chick-fil-A of Temple, Texas,

79
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,160
 and I sat for a minute and I just evaluated everything that needed to happen in order

80
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,840
 for me to get in and out with my two boys without dying.

81
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,400
 And so I felt like I had my game plan.

82
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,760
 I got out of the car.

83
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,280
 I had Andrew in the car carrier in one hand.

84
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,720
 I had the diaper bag slung over my chest.

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,560
 I had Noah, my two and a half year old, in the other hand, and we are walking in to Chick-fil-A.

86
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,360
 And you could just see the sympathy on the Chick-fil-A worker's face.

87
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
 He was like, "My pleasure."

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,860
 Like, it's always their pleasure, but this time it was absolutely his pleasure.

89
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:58,200
 So we go into the Chick-fil-A, I order, and we sit down, and everything is going perfect

90
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:06,760
 during lunch until my five-month-old Andrew, who's in the car seat, just destroys his diaper.

91
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,360
 Like right there in the middle of my number one with no pickles in Chick-fil-A sauce.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,920
 Like he just absolutely destroyed his diaper.

93
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,840
 It was the type of thing that if I was going to be a good dad, I'm not going to finish

94
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,360
 my lunch before changing him.

95
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
 I'm going to change him now.

96
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,320
 So I gathered up all of our stuff.

97
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,520
 We went into the bathroom of the Chick-fil-A in Temple, Texas.

98
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,240
 I pulled down the changing table.

99
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,640
 I put my five-month-old on it.

100
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,760
 I tell my two-and-a-half-year-old, "Noah, stand right here.

101
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,520
 Just stand right here."

102
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,240
 And I just begin ferociously wiping Andrew down.

103
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,600
 Like I'm trying to clean this kid off.

104
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,800
 And right as I'm cleaning him off, he goes to the bathroom, a different number this time,

105
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,360
 and he floods the changing table.

106
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,960
 Like this thing is out of order.

107
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,200
 Like he floods the changing table.

108
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,320
 And right as he floods the changing table, I use my last wet wipe.

109
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,040
 So I just want to put you, I want to put you there, people.

110
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,760
 Okay, I just want you to, I want you to imagine, here I am in the Chick-fil-A of Temple, Texas.

111
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:25,480
 I am holding a bare-bottomed baby up in the air with nowhere to put him and nothing to

112
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,640
 clean him up with.

113
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,880
 You might be like, "That sounds like worst-case scenario."

114
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,680
 It wasn't.

115
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,600
 You want to know what the worst-case scenario was?

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,360
 The worst-case scenario was holding a bare-bottomed baby in the air with nowhere to put him and

117
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,280
 nothing to wipe him down with, looking left, just in time to see your two-and-a-half-year-old

118
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,000
 playing with the urinal cake.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,200
 That's the worst-case scenario.

120
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,520
 So let's talk about stress tonight.

121
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,200
 Because I will tell you, when I was standing there in that bathroom, I felt stressed out,

122
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,360
 overwhelmed, and out of control.

123
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,920
 That is what I felt in that moment.

124
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,240
 And that was just for a day.

125
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,560
 Praise the Lord, I got out of that situation, and that stress only lasted for a brief time.

126
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,680
 But here's the reality.

127
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,640
 Some of you guys have much more significant things going on in your life, and it's causing

128
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
 stress.

129
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,720
 And we're talking about it on Election Night, because some of you just sang "I Trust God,"

130
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,160
 but the reality is, is you might feel like the world is over if your candidate doesn't

131
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
 win.

132
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
 And you're like, "Man, is this it?

133
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,240
 Am I leaving the country?

134
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,960
 Is Jesus coming back tomorrow?"

135
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,400
 Like for you, it's deeply stressful.

136
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:52,400
 Or maybe your life has just not turned out how you thought that it would at this age.

137
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,520
 Maybe you're not living up to your own expectations, and that's really stressing you out.

138
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:05,760
 Or it's that time of year where bonuses are just kind of that close that you're beginning

139
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,920
 to wonder, "How much is it going to be?

140
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,040
 Am I going to get it?

141
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,240
 Will there be a promotion?

142
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,680
 Is there not going to be a promotion?

143
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,720
 Am I about to lose my job?

144
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,440
 Is my company going to downsize?

145
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,680
 Inflation is kind of a thing.

146
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,280
 Holidays are coming up."

147
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:29,120
 For some people, that spells disaster when it comes to being with family.

148
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,640
 Maybe you're in a relationship and you're just wondering what the timeline of this thing

149
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,880
 even is.

150
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,480
 There's just so much to be stressed out about.

151
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,080
 Some of you are stressed and you don't even know why you're stressed, you just know you

152
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
 are.

153
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,880
 Like if any of those things are going on in your life, I just wouldn't be surprised if

154
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,340
 you don't feel what I felt standing in that Chick-fil-A bathroom.

155
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,560
 If you're honest, you feel stressed out, overwhelmed, and out of control.

156
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,400
 Here's the good news.

157
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,280
 According to the Scriptures, what I want to show you tonight is that stress isn't inevitable,

158
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,880
 it's actually optional.

159
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,080
 Like what I want to invite you into tonight is I just want to invite you into peace and

160
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,400
 I want to share four truths from the Word of God that speak directly, directly to your

161
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,520
 peace and what you do with these four truths will have everything to do with whether your

162
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,720
 soul feels chaotic or calm tonight and in the days ahead.

163
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,560
 It will impact whether you live under pressure or filled with peace.

164
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,960
 Stress isn't inevitable, it's actually optional.

165
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,760
 So if you have a Bible, I want to invite you to turn with me to Mark chapter 4.

166
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,680
 Mark chapter 4 is where we're going to be.

167
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,040
 Now as you're turning there, I really need you to listen, okay?

168
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,600
 Because some of you all just heard me say that stress isn't inevitable, it's actually

169
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,760
 optional and that stressed you out.

170
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,640
 It stressed you out that I said you shouldn't be stressed out.

171
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,600
 So here's what I want to make sure you hear.

172
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,160
 Some of you guys in here, like you have, you have like clinical anxiety.

173
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,160
 And if that's you, I want to make sure you know I'm not speaking about your clinical

174
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,360
 anxiety, like your anxiety disorder.

175
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,160
 That's not what I'm speaking to tonight.

176
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,680
 And so I want you to feel the weight lift from you that I'm not trying to put a weight

177
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,800
 on you that's going to feel crushing right now.

178
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:36,080
 What I'm trying to speak to, as I'm speaking to the everyday stress that the good majority

179
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:44,160
 of us allow to weigh us down when we have a Savior and a King who is before all things

180
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,640
 and in Him all things hold together.

181
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:54,840
 I'm just trying to invite, I'm trying to invite us closer to Jesus and to peace.

182
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,320
 So we're looking at Mark chapter 4.

183
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,440
 The gospel of Mark was written by a guy named John Mark.

184
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,980
 John Mark was not an eyewitness to the things that he wrote.

185
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,680
 He actually got his accounts of what we're reading from Peter.

186
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,800
 He was a disciple of Peter.

187
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,720
 If you're not familiar with the Bible, Jesus had 12 really close friends.

188
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,960
 But there were three of those 12 friends that he spent extra time with and their names were

189
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,680
 Peter, James, and John.

190
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,640
 Peter was one of the people who was closest to Jesus.

191
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:36,000
 A lot of people in the early church, the first century church, viewed Mark's gospel as Peter's

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 memoirs.

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,440
 And so John Mark is learning from Peter's eyewitness accounts.

194
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,680
 John Mark wrote this book to portray the person and mission of Jesus Christ for roaming Christians

195
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,340
 undergoing persecution under Nero.

196
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,280
 So I would imagine that they felt stressed out, overwhelmed, and out of control.

197
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,000
 And so it's helpful for these Christians who are undergoing persecution from Nero to hear

198
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,280
 a story about Jesus calming a storm.

199
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,800
 So let's pick it back up.

200
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,320
 We just read it, but listen to it again.

201
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,520
 It sets the scene for us.

202
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,760
 Verse 35 of Mark 4, it says, "On that day, when evening had come, he," that's Jesus,

203
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,520
 "said to them, 'Let us go across to the other side.'

204
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,780
 And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was.

205
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,860
 And other boats were with him, and a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking

206
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,240
 into the boat, so that the boat was already filling.

207
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,800
 But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion.

208
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,040
 And they woke him and said to him, 'Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?'"

209
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,640
 I love this.

210
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,800
 I love this passage so much.

211
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,120
 So I just want you to get what is happening here.

212
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
 Okay?

213
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,280
 So you got Jesus and his friends, they begin to go across the Sea of Galilee.

214
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,560
 What you need to understand is that the Sea of Galilee is situated at about 700 feet below

215
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,760
 sea level, and it's surrounded by hills.

216
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,360
 The Sea of Galilee, I've been on it before, it is known for sudden and violent storms.

217
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,800
 Jesus and his friends find themselves in one of these sudden and violent storms.

218
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,040
 What's interesting, though, is to think about who is on the boat with Jesus.

219
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,380
 If you're familiar with the Bible, and you're familiar with what the occupations were of

220
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:38,080
 several of Jesus' friends, what was their occupation?

221
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
 They were fishermen.

222
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:45,620
 At least four of them were fishermen, which means the Sea of Galilee had been their office.

223
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,600
 These were boat guys.

224
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,560
 And yet these guys who officed on the Sea of Galilee find themselves in a storm that

225
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,220
 has them freaking out.

226
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,160
 Which I find really interesting.

227
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,300
 Like I believe that this was the worst storm they had ever experienced in their life, because

228
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,380
 we don't see even the professional fishermen saying, "Hey guys, we've been here before.

229
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,380
 You do this.

230
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,380
 You sit here.

231
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,440
 We're going to make it.

232
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
 Don't freak out.

233
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,980
 This is just what happens on the Sea of Galilee."

234
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,780
 No, the professional fisherman is like, "This is it!

235
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,300
 This is it!

236
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,580
 We are going to die!"

237
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,180
 And as water fills the boat, stress fills their souls.

238
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,560
 Why?

239
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,160
 Because they're no longer in control.

240
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,760
 Which shows us the very first truth that we need to understand about stress.

241
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,780
 At the root of your stress is a lack of control.

242
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,920
 You realize that, right?

243
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,700
 At the root of your stress is a lack of control.

244
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,340
 Just think right now what you can't control.

245
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,140
 You can't control the outcome of the election tonight.

246
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,900
 You can't control how much free time you have.

247
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,160
 You can't manufacture a 30-hour workday.

248
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,320
 You can't control whether you're going to get that raise or not.

249
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,920
 You can't control chronic pain.

250
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,600
 You can't control your loved one's health.

251
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,560
 You can't control it.

252
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,600
 At the root of your stress is a lack of control.

253
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,240
 So that's where we have to start.

254
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,700
 Now if that is true, if at the root of your stress is a lack of control, you're going

255
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,860
 to love the second truth I have for you.

256
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,540
 Okay, here's the second truth.

257
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,100
 God will intentionally lead you into situations that you cannot control.

258
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,700
 No one's saying amen to that.

259
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,940
 Like that's just...

260
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,620
 Isn't that great news?

261
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,900
 At the root of your stress is a lack of control.

262
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,300
 And great news, God will intentionally lead you into situations you cannot control.

263
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,780
 Do you remember whose idea it was to go across to the other side of the Sea of Galilee?

264
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,780
 Whose was it?

265
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,340
 It was Jesus's.

266
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:04,800
 Jesus was and is God, which means Jesus knew that he was inviting his friends to cross

267
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,620
 the sea at the exact same time as an "I think we are going to die" type of storm was going

268
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,160
 to be brewing.

269
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,980
 So I have to believe that Jesus intentionally led them into the storm.

270
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,800
 And if you were to go and read this book, you would see that that's what God has a tendency

271
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,900
 of doing.

272
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,980
 He consistently leads his people into situations that they cannot control.

273
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,900
 Think about Joseph in the book of Genesis.

274
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,940
 He's thrown into a well and sold into slavery by his brothers.

275
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,220
 The nation of Israel was busted out of Egypt and led by Moses, but where did Moses lead

276
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
 them?

277
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,140
 To a dead end at the Red Sea.

278
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,820
 Daniel was thrown into a lion's den.

279
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,440
 Zachariah and Elizabeth were old, wrinkly, and barren.

280
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,140
 This is what God does.

281
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,680
 He will intentionally lead him...

282
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:12,100
 He will intentionally lead his people into situations that they cannot control.

283
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:22,080
 The problem with that is that we love control.

284
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,760
 Like some of you guys are budding control freaks.

285
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,200
 Some of you guys are in full bloom.

286
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,400
 Like you know who you are.

287
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
 You're like, "Yeah, that's me."

288
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,220
 I love control.

289
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,960
 You want to have every single aspect of your life under control.

290
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,480
 Hair has to be perfect.

291
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
 Clothes have to be perfect.

292
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,520
 Weight on the scale has to be perfect.

293
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,360
 Organization on the desk, perfect.

294
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,800
 Your day has to go exactly how you planned.

295
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,520
 You need everything under control.

296
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,000
 And if you're one of those people who needs every single aspect of your life under control,

297
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,120
 you know what your life is going to feel like?

298
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,840
 Some of you all have heard me share this before.

299
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,740
 It's going to feel like trying to carry a big pile of laundry.

300
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
 You know what I'm talking about?

301
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:13,620
 Like you go to the dryer, you open up the door, and like we're busy people, right?

302
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:19,420
 So we only have time for one trip from the dryer to the couch or to wherever you're taking

303
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,580
 your laundry, right?

304
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:27,540
 So you reach in there, you scrape the insides of the dryer until you really...

305
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,820
 Like something in your mind clicks like, "Yep, I got it all.

306
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
 Yeah.

307
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,860
 I have every article of clothing in my grasp."

308
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,660
 And then you begin to make the walk.

309
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,380
 And as you're making the walk, like you just...

310
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,400
 Something triggers inside like, "Hey, just look back."

311
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,300
 And when you look back, what do you see?

312
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,620
 Man down.

313
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,580
 Sock down.

314
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:04,380
 Now this is where we display our brilliance because instead of taking that pile of laundry,

315
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,940
 dropping it off and coming back, no, we're busy.

316
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,700
 And we developed this very noble and heroic mantra of no sock left behind.

317
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:22,180
 And so we back up to the sock and we try and balance the entire pile on one hand as if

318
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,860
 we were crushing it with two hands.

319
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,140
 And just when you get that sock, what do you see?

320
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,340
 Whitey tighties down.

321
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,620
 And shame on you for never switching to boxers.

322
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,740
 What are you doing with your life?

323
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,260
 But like this...

324
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,700
 Look, if you need to have everything in control of your life, this is going to be your reality.

325
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,500
 Like you're going to feel like, "Man, I'm crushing life one day and then the financial

326
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,540
 sock's going to fall."

327
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,180
 And just when you feel like, "Man, you get that back under control," you know what?

328
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,940
 There goes your relationship status.

329
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,180
 And just when you get that back in control, okay, here comes your parents' divorce.

330
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:06,780
 And like it's just one thing after another where you want control and you can't have

331
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,100
 it.

332
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,980
 And I think it begs the question, like if Jesus loves us, why does he lead us into situations

333
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,420
 we can't control?

334
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,760
 It feels unloving.

335
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,660
 And I'll answer that before we're done.

336
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,460
 The third key truth that I want you to know is this, you don't have to be in control because

337
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,660
 Jesus already is.

338
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,700
 And we sang about that tonight.

339
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,780
 Here's the great news on the night of the 2024 election, you don't have to be in control

340
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,500
 because Jesus already is.

341
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,260
 Your candidate doesn't have to win because Jesus Christ already reigns, which is really

342
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
 good news.

343
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,580
 But you don't have to be in control because Jesus Christ already is.

344
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,780
 Watch how things play out for the disciples.

345
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,980
 Look back at the text.

346
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,680
 Verse chapter 4, verse 39.

347
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,420
 It says, "And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, 'Peace be still.'

348
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,740
 And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.

349
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,260
 He said to them, 'Why are you so afraid?

350
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,780
 Have you still no faith?'

351
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:25,580
 And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, 'Who then is this that even

352
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,740
 the wind and the sea obey him?'"

353
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,340
 This is amazing.

354
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,600
 Like they come to him, and I love their question.

355
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,860
 Their question is what?

356
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,780
 Do you not care that we're perishing?

357
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,060
 That's how real the Bible is.

358
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:49,500
 Like they are coming up to God in the flesh, they're like, "You don't even care."

359
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,980
 And Jesus wakes up and what does he do?

360
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,020
 He begins to speak to the storm.

361
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,060
 And what are the words that come out of his mouth?

362
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,220
 "Peace be still."

363
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:04,000
 Now this is where you have to learn to see the scriptures.

364
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,020
 You have to start putting yourself into the story.

365
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,300
 Because sometimes we get the wrong picture of Jesus, like he's groggy, just woke up from

366
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,500
 a nap and he's like, "Oh man, peace.

367
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 Peace be still."

368
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,860
 No, I didn't know that was what was going to come out.

369
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,340
 Like you never know sometimes up here.

370
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,460
 When he says, "Peace be still," he uses the Greek word, "Themao."

371
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,980
 Themao is the same word he used back in chapter one of Mark when he cast out a demon.

372
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,120
 You know what it means?

373
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,300
 It literally means to muzzle.

374
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,940
 So don't imagine saying, "Peace be still."

375
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,540
 Imagine him saying, "Shut up.

376
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,940
 Be quiet."

377
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,060
 It's like putting a muzzle on an unruly dog.

378
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:04,940
 Like when I read this, I thought of this TV show that used to be on.

379
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,300
 It was probably long before y'all's time, but it was called The Dog Whisperer.

380
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,220
 And The Dog Whisperer was this show about this world-renowned dog trainer named Caesar

381
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,700
 Milan.

382
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:22,260
 And the way the show would go is that it would open with like this montage of clips of like

383
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,660
 an unruly dog.

384
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:30,820
 The dog would be like barking and biting his owner and like eating an entire couch in one

385
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,820
 sitting.

386
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:37,080
 And then Caesar would show up, knock on the door, the dog would come up, and Caesar would

387
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,460
 just look at the dog and go, "Hey.

388
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,700
 Hey."

389
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:52,940
 And the dog would like stop what it was doing, like do the head tilt and fall over and die.

390
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,700
 It was crazy.

391
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,640
 It was crazy.

392
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,740
 But I read this and I'm like, yeah, Jesus is the sea whisperer.

393
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,660
 Like he, Jesus just steps in and he's like, "Hey.

394
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
 Be quiet.

395
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,660
 Be silent.

396
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
 Peace.

397
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,660
 Shut up.

398
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,660
 Put a muzzle on it."

399
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:20,900
 And in a moment in time, the sea goes from chaotic to calm.

400
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,020
 What if the great calm of the sea could be the great calm of the soul?

401
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:30,940
 You know what I love is that everyone on the boat is freaking out.

402
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,260
 But did you see the word "but" in verse 38?

403
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:43,740
 That word, when you learn Bible study methods, people tell you to look out for the "but"

404
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,640
 because the "but" marks a contrast.

405
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,900
 So if I'm studying the scripture, I want to put a box around that because it's something

406
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,320
 that you want to highlight.

407
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,500
 You want to zero in on because what the author of the text is trying to show you is that

408
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:09,260
 what's coming after the word "but" is very different than what came before it.

409
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,580
 What comes after the "but"?

410
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:17,340
 But he was in the stern asleep on the cushion.

411
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,380
 Everyone's freaking out.

412
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,020
 Jesus is asleep.

413
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,980
 How was he able to sleep through the storm?

414
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,640
 Because he wasn't threatened by the storm.

415
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,580
 Those waters had been made by God simply speaking.

416
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,040
 Surely they could be calmed in the exact same way.

417
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,820
 And I believe that tonight is an invitation, whether it's the election that's causing you

418
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,500
 stress or one of the other many things that I mentioned, but I believe that God is inviting

419
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,060
 many of us and just saying, "Hey, look, the great calm of the sea can be the great calm

420
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
 of the soul.

421
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,740
 Like, he wants to speak peace into your life tonight."

422
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,980
 And you know what the good news is?

423
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:05,380
 Is that, you know what, that can sound really nice and flowery.

424
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,940
 It's like, "Okay, TAs, this guest speaker is just saying, 'Oh, just be at peace.'

425
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,980
 But that sounds really good in this room."

426
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,820
 But then when you leave, it's like, "I don't even know what that looks like."

427
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,100
 You know what the good news is, is that the Apostle Paul tells us the way.

428
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,420
 Listen to what he says in Philippians 4, 6 through 7.

429
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:31,740
 He says, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication,

430
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,500
 with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."

431
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:42,060
 And watch this, "In the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your

432
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,900
 hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

433
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,620
 So let's just unpack that real quick.

434
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,780
 So he says, "Do not be anxious about anything."

435
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,420
 So that is a command from God through Paul to us.

436
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,140
 Do not be anxious about anything.

437
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,780
 Do you know what anything means in the Greek?

438
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,180
 Anything.

439
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
 That's what it means.

440
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,100
 It means anything.

441
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,660
 Do not be anxious about anything.

442
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,740
 And like, at least in my Bible, and you can check yours, but at least in my Bible, next

443
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,760
 to the word anything, there's not an asterisk that points me to a footnote at the bottom

444
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,520
 of the text, like giving me caveats.

445
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,900
 Do not be anxious about anything, except at the 2024 election when you've only got two

446
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,660
 options, Harris or Trump.

447
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:33,580
 Do not be anxious about anything, except when your relationship status feels like it is

448
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
 falling apart.

449
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,940
 Do not be anxious about anything, asterisk, footnote, except when you haven't lived up

450
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:46,300
 to your expectations and life just isn't what you thought it would be at the age of 28.

451
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,740
 Do not be anxious about it.

452
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:53,420
 No, do not be anxious about anything.

453
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
 But then he goes on.

454
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,460
 And what does he say?

455
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,780
 Not in everything.

456
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,780
 Everything means everything.

457
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,940
 In everything.

458
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,940
 By prayer in supplication.

459
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
 So what's his point?

460
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,300
 Like, if something's stressing you out, God wants to hear about it.

461
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,000
 Whatever's stressing you out right now, have you talked to God about it?

462
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 What I'm not asking you is have you talked at God about it?

463
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,700
 I'm asking you if you have invited Him in.

464
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,300
 Sometimes we want to talk at God about what's stressing us out, but we want to keep it,

465
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,180
 we want to keep the ball in our court.

466
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,700
 Like we really don't want to give it over to Him.

467
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,460
 We keep trying to control and manage.

468
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,940
 So what I'm asking you is have you invited Him in?

469
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:49,000
 Paul says, by prayer and supplication, and then watch this word.

470
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,140
 He says, with thanksgiving.

471
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:59,580
 Now this is where I feel like my tendency is to think that Paul messed up and erasers

472
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,420
 didn't exist back then.

473
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:07,180
 He's like, okay, you're stressed out, you're anxious, but don't be anxious, and you've

474
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,860
 got to pray about it.

475
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,540
 And then thanksgiving, oh shoot, no, you don't thank God yet.

476
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,980
 He hasn't done anything about it.

477
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,420
 You save that to the end.

478
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:24,340
 Now, our tendency is to think that the order of things is something happens, we stress

479
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:33,100
 out, we pray, God does something about it, and then we say thank you.

480
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,260
 Paul's like, no, that's not how it works.

481
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,700
 Something happens, you start stressing out, you start praying about it, and you start

482
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,860
 thanking God right in the midst of the uncertainty.

483
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,980
 Have you ever tried that?

484
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,860
 Have you ever stopped in the midst of the stress and started thanking God for what He's

485
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,140
 done in the past?

486
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,660
 Because when you remember that God's been faithful, it reminds you that He's capable.

487
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,540
 He's been faithful in the past, He's capable with your present.

488
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,540
 So try that.

489
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,260
 Just start looking back and thanking God for what He's already done.

490
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,200
 But I also want to encourage you to try thanking God for what He will do.

491
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,700
 Have you ever tried that?

492
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,660
 God, I thank you in advance for what you're going to do.

493
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,940
 Now what I'm not talking about right now is like a name it and claim it thing, like that

494
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,020
 if you just pray and ask God for it, and you ask Him for $10,000 tomorrow, it's just going

495
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,300
 to show up in your mailbox.

496
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,540
 That's not what I'm talking about.

497
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,500
 Thank you God that you're going to give me a new car this week.

498
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 Thank you God.

499
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,260
 That's not what I'm talking about.

500
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,780
 I'm just saying you put your confidence in God, thank you.

501
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,420
 God, I'm going to make it this week because you're in control of my life.

502
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,380
 I don't know how you're going to figure this out.

503
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,380
 I don't know what you're going to do, but I do know that you're in control.

504
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,900
 You're before all things and in you all things hold together.

505
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,140
 So I'm grateful because I'm safe in your hands.

506
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,680
 And I can't see a way out, but just because I can't doesn't mean you can't.

507
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,780
 And so I trust you.

508
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,340
 Thank Him for what He will do.

509
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,220
 Let your requests be made known to God, watch this, in the peace of God which surpasses

510
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,860
 all understanding will.

511
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,380
 That's a promise from God through Paul to you.

512
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:22,340
 It doesn't say that it might guard your hearts and your minds, it says that it will guard

513
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:29,140
 your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

514
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,340
 You want to know what stress ultimately is?

515
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,620
 Stress is simply a distress signal from your soul that you're looking inward instead of

516
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,420
 upward.

517
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:42,260
 You're looking to yourself for the solution.

518
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,740
 You're looking for control that you don't have.

519
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,900
 Paul's point is, "Hey, stop looking inward, start looking upward."

520
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,140
 You have been made to look upward.

521
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:00,400
 Put your trust in Him.

522
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,100
 The fourth truth that I need you to know tonight is this.

523
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,540
 When you can't control life, you have two options, fear or faith.

524
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,900
 Those are your two options, fear or faith.

525
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,580
 The normal and natural response to a lack of control is fear.

526
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,220
 That's what stress is.

527
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,200
 It's when you don't have control, when you can't see the outcome, you can't see how something's

528
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,700
 going to turn out, and it causes fear.

529
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,700
 That's what stress is.

530
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:33,500
 It's fear of the unknown.

531
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,340
 Fear was the disciples' response.

532
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:41,180
 We know that because Jesus asked them, "Why are you afraid?"

533
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,580
 But look at what else He says.

534
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,140
 Look back at the text.

535
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,660
 Verse 40, "Why are you so afraid?

536
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,260
 Have you still no faith?"

537
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,980
 So Jesus' point is, "Hey, you actually had two options.

538
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,660
 You chose fear, but you had the option of faith."

539
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,220
 Why did they have that option?

540
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:08,140
 Because Jesus, the one who calms storms, was in the boat.

541
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:13,740
 And so His point was, "You chose fear when you had the option of faith, because the one

542
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,620
 who just has to say the word was in the boat."

543
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:23,340
 Maybe God brought you here tonight so that you could simply hear that stress isn't inevitable,

544
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,340
 is optional.

545
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,500
 You do have a choice.

546
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
 Why?

547
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,540
 Because Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, the one who just has to say the word, is in

548
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,940
 the boat of your life, and He cares.

549
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,500
 And He's passionate about your peace.

550
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,820
 If you ever question if God cares about your peace, all you have to do is look at the cross

551
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:47,980
 of Jesus Christ, because the cross is a message of peace.

552
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:53,940
 Colossians 119 says this, "For in Him," that's in Jesus, "all the fullness of God was pleased

553
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:01,140
 to dwell in, through Him to reconcile to Himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven,

554
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,460
 making peace by the blood of His cross."

555
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,020
 So just listen to this.

556
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,700
 Jesus died, was buried, and rose from the dead so that we could experience peace.

557
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:19,260
 On the cross, Jesus Christ was crucified, punished for your sins and mine, and when

558
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:27,380
 He declared on the cross, "It is finished," it was the same thing as Jesus saying, "Shut

559
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,940
 up to the storm."

560
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,220
 Because when He declared, "It is finished," that was His way of saying, "Be quiet to a

561
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:41,500
 different storm, the storm of sin that threatened to separate you and me from Him for all of

562
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
 eternity."

563
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:48,580
 He has gone to the cross and He has conquered the grave, making peace.

564
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:53,500
 So if you're, if this is your first time at the porch, if you don't know anything about

565
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,340
 Christianity, then I want to make sure you hear what I'm saying.

566
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,580
 Our message tonight isn't, "Do better, try harder."

567
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,420
 It's, "Hey, there's peace available with the God of the universe."

568
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:13,120
 Like you can leave tonight having peace with your Maker.

569
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,660
 Like you don't have to wait, you don't have to wonder, lay awake on those nights where

570
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,560
 it's just you and your thoughts and wonder, "Like if I were to die tonight, like what's

571
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
 going to happen?"

572
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,980
 Like if I stand before God and He looks at me and says, "Why do you deserve to be in

573
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
 heaven?"

574
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,780
 Like you don't have to wonder.

575
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,480
 Jesus Christ came to make peace between you and God.

576
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,100
 He takes all of your sin and He gives you all of His righteousness.

577
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,180
 So that when the God of the universe looks at you, you know what He sees through faith

578
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,500
 in Christ?

579
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:54,460
 He sees the righteousness of Jesus Christ, His Son, which is incredible.

580
00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:03,260
 You can have peace with God tonight, but the only way it comes is through faith.

581
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,460
 It's inviting Christ into your life.

582
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,300
 It's giving your life to Jesus and just saying, "Jesus, I don't want to do life without You

583
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,440
 anymore."

584
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,060
 Like if you're the one and only one who can make peace with God, I want You.

585
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:24,340
 I want You to be the King of my life.

586
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,660
 Jesus cares about your peace.

587
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,380
 And if you ever question if God is in control, all you have to do is look at the empty tomb

588
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,440
 because that's where Jesus Christ took His life back from the grave.

589
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:43,100
 That's why Jesus can say in Revelation chapter 1 that He holds the keys to death and Hades.

590
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,960
 He is sovereign and in control of all things.

591
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,900
 So it kind of brings us to this question, like if Jesus loves us, then why would He

592
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,460
 lead us into situations that we can't control?

593
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,540
 Here's the simple answer.

594
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:06,580
 It gives Him an opportunity to show up in your life.

595
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:12,100
 The worst thing that He could ever do for you is let you go your whole life thinking

596
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:19,480
 that you are self-sufficient, to let you get to the end of your life and stand before God

597
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:28,460
 and realize that without a Savior, you have nothing.

598
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:34,360
 What if Jesus loves us so much to know that there's more joy waiting for us in dependence

599
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,960
 upon Him than in control of our own lives?

600
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,280
 What if He cares so much about our joy that He invites us into situations where we have

601
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,660
 no choice but to depend on Him?

602
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,660
 You know, it's interesting.

603
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,080
 I said that you have two choices, fear or faith.

604
00:38:53,080 --> 00:39:02,600
 But I want you to look back at the wording of verse 41.

605
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,920
 What's their response when Jesus calms the storm?

606
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,520
 It says, "And they were filled with great fear."

607
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,800
 You would think it would say, "And they were filled with great faith."

608
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,360
 Jesus says, "Why are you afraid?

609
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,600
 Have you still no faith?"

610
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,960
 They should be filled with faith now, but it says, "Jesus said, 'Why are you so afraid?

611
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
 Have you still no faith?'

612
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,200
 And they were filled with great fear."

613
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
 That feels off.

614
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,920
 It's a different type of fear.

615
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,880
 You know what faith is?

616
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,320
 Faith is choosing not to fear your circumstances because you fear the one who's in control

617
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
 of your circumstances.

618
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,760
 See, it's a different type of fear.

619
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,120
 It's a fear driven by faith.

620
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,500
 It's not the opposite of faith.

621
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,920
 It's the product of faith.

622
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,400
 It's believing that the one who's in control of your life, the one who's in the boat of

623
00:39:53,400 --> 00:40:00,480
 your life, is in control and can give peace.

624
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,440
 I'll close by just showing you one more thing in the Scriptures.

625
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,640
 So years ago I was just battling some stress and anxiety in my life and so I went to see

626
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,080
 a biblical counselor.

627
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,200
 A biblical counselor is just someone who opens up the Bible, listens to what's going on in

628
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,720
 your life, and then shares Scripture with you to encourage you with it.

629
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,520
 And so I sit with him, I share with him what's causing me stress, and guess where he takes

630
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,840
 me in the Bible?

631
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
 Mark chapter 4.

632
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,080
 So he opens up Mark chapter 4, tells me his story about Jesus coming to the storm.

633
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
 I'm like, "That's so great.

634
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,080
 Thank you so much.

635
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,960
 I paid a lot of money just for you to show me that story."

636
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,480
 Okay, that's great.

637
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,300
 But before our session was over, this is the thing that I remember.

638
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,800
 Before that session was over, he just said, "Hey man, you have to see Acts chapter 12."

639
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,520
 I was like, "Man, what's Acts chapter 12?"

640
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,280
 And he had me turn over to Acts chapter 12, which is a story about Peter.

641
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,000
 Peter was one of the guys in the boat.

642
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,320
 Now what's interesting is we don't know who ran to Jesus and said, "Do you not care that

643
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,160
 we're perishing?"

644
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,840
 But if you know anything about Peter, it sounds like something he would say.

645
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,240
 We don't know for sure.

646
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,520
 Peter was a speak first, think second kind of guy.

647
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,200
 But we do know that that question articulates what everyone in the boat was thinking.

648
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,840
 Do you not care?

649
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,040
 And so this is amazing.

650
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
 Turn to Acts chapter 12.

651
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,240
 It's a story about Peter.

652
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:41,400
 King Herod has just put James to death.

653
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:49,360
 And he sees that people are so excited that he put James to death that he arrests Peter.

654
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,640
 And what the text kind of leads us to believe is on that night, like Herod plans to put

655
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,860
 Peter to death.

656
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:06,020
 So here Peter is on another night with a different storm where his life is on the line.

657
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,540
 But listen to what Peter is doing.

658
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,540
 This is amazing.

659
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,540
 Watch this.

660
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,820
 Now when Herod was about to bring him out on that very night, what's Peter doing?

661
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,460
 Peter was sleeping.

662
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,460
 Between two soldiers bound with two chains and sentries before the doors were guarding

663
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,460
 the prison.

664
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,940
 Behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him and a light shone in the cell.

665
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,540
 He struck Peter on the side and welcomed saying, "Get up quickly."

666
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,620
 And the chains fell off his hands.

667
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,940
 So just think about this.

668
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,460
 Follow me on this.

669
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:39,300
 Peter's on the boat, runs to Jesus and what's Jesus doing?

670
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,740
 He's sleeping.

671
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,300
 What's Peter's question?

672
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,500
 Or one of their questions.

673
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,180
 Do you not care that we're perishing?

674
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:52,060
 Jesus gets up, calms the storm, goes to the cross, conquers the grave, comes to Peter,

675
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,500
 looks at Peter and says to him in John 21, "You follow me."

676
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:02,300
 And Peter took him so seriously that on another night with another storm where his life is

677
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,660
 on the line, you know what he does?

678
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,260
 He's like, "I know exactly what to do.

679
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,340
 I go to sleep."

680
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,540
 He said to follow me.

681
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,780
 I know what to do when storms in life come.

682
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,060
 I sleep peacefully.

683
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,260
 And he's sleeping so peacefully that an angel shows up and it's not enough.

684
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,260
 Did you see the text?

685
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,900
 Like the angel comes in, light shines, he's still asleep.

686
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,700
 The angel has to strike him to wake him.

687
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,700
 It's amazing.

688
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,260
 It's like, "Dude, get up.

689
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,260
 I'm an angel.

690
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,340
 You should be up by now."

691
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:38,500
 And so it's just a good, it's instructive.

692
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:44,700
 Like if sleeping peacefully when death is knocking at the door is the goal, then can't

693
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,740
 we all agree that we probably all have some room to grow?

694
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,940
 Like tonight are you going to sleep peacefully?

695
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,940
 Like whenever you find out who wins this election, are you going to be able to sleep at night?

696
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,780
 Like what's going to keep you up tonight?

697
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:08,500
 And will you lay down and go to sleep knowing that the Prince of Peace, the one who just

698
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:14,340
 has to say the word is in the boat of your life and he cares?

699
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:22,020
 Let's pray together.

700
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:29,660
 I just want to invite you right now, look, here's what we're going to do.

701
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:34,780
 We're going to have people up front who are available and ready to pray with you.

702
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,940
 So if it would be helpful to you to talk to someone or have someone pray with you over

703
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,380
 what's stressing you out, you can totally do that.

704
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:50,020
 We're going to sing in just a minute, but if you need to kind of ask your friend to

705
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,880
 pray over you, to put a hand on you and pray over you and whatever's stressing you out,

706
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,880
 you should do that.

707
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,100
 You don't have to rush out of this place.

708
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:06,100
 You can sit here and do business with the Lord and just wait on Him to bring peace into

709
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,180
 your life for whatever it is.

710
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,220
 If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus and you're realizing

711
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:19,860
 for the first time that Jesus Christ wants to give you peace with God, then I want to

712
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,820
 encourage you right now just to invite Christ into your life.

713
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,820
 So pray with me.

714
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,020
 Just say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?

715
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:32,300
 Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.

716
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,800
 Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

717
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,860
 Would you come into my life?

718
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:44,540
 Would you forgive me of all of my sins?

719
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,100
 Would you make me at peace with God?

720
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:55,100
 And would you lead me in a new life?"

721
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,820
 If you just received Christ into your life, my encouragement to you is to tell someone

722
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,820
 tonight.

723
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:07,000
 And for everyone else here, this is just time for you to, maybe you need to sing in response

724
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,540
 to declare that you trust Jesus.

725
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,700
 Maybe you need to sit and pray.

726
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,700
 Whatever you need to do, if you need to come up and have someone pray for you, this is

727
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,380
 the time for you to respond to God.

728
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,060
 We need you and we love you.

729
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,020
 In Jesus' name, amen.
