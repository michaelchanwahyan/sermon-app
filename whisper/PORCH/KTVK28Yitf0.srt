1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
 "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,580
 He makes me lie down in green pastures, He leads me beside still waters.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,500
 He restores my soul, He leads me in the path of righteousness for His name's sake.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,180
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,180
 are with me.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,520
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,200
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,880
 You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,520
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,920
 in the house of the Lord forever."

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,520
 Hey, what's up, Porch?

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
 How we doing tonight?

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,160
 Hey, if this is your first time here, my name is Timothy Atik, and I'm one of the teaching

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
 pastors here at Watermark on Sundays as well as here at the Porch.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,400
 I want to say hello to everyone in the room as well as everyone watching at a Porch Live

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,520
 location in different parts of the country.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,800
 So glad that you are tuning in with us.

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,760
 And I know that there's people literally all over the world just sitting at their computer

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,920
 or watching their TV, watching the Porch with us right now.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,680
 And so I want you to know we see you, and we're so glad that you are joining with us

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,860
 tonight.

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,520
 We are in week four of a series where we have just been walking verse by verse through

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,860
 the most famous chapter in the entire Bible, which is Psalm 23, which we just heard.

24
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,220
 And I'm so excited about where we are landing tonight in verse five.

25
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,300
 To set it up, I'll just share this with you.

26
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,480
 When I was in sixth grade, I was at Dallas Love Field Airport preparing to fly from Dallas

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,940
 to Austin, and my cousin, who was a single young adult man at the time, took me to the

28
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,420
 airport.

29
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,540
 And while we were in the airport, he asked me if I had something to write with, and I

30
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,340
 was bending down looking for something in my backpack to write with.

31
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,220
 And while I was doing that, my cousin, the reason I told you he was a single young adult

32
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:16,340
 was because it had been raining outside, and he had the umbrella of a single young adult.

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,760
 It was male.

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,580
 It was an umbrella without a handle on it.

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,820
 It was just the metal end.

36
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,540
 It was super janky, but he just went ahead and used it.

37
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,960
 And as I was bent down looking in my bag, he threw the umbrella on the ground, total

38
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:39,680
 freak accident, it popped open, and that metal end shot up and hit me right in my right eye.

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,740
 And I went into the bathroom, and I pulled down my eyelid, and there was this massive

40
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,340
 red abrasion on my right eye.

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,400
 And I was crying like crazy.

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,980
 And my cousin didn't know what to do with me, so he just put me on the plane and sent

43
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,820
 me to Austin for his brother to deal with it.

44
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,660
 So when I landed, I cried the whole way to Austin.

45
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,900
 When I landed, my other cousin took me to the emergency room where they gave me eye

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,440
 drops in an eye patch.

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,340
 And I will never forget this eye patch because it was blue with white felt on it and a picture

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,080
 of a Dalmatian dog.

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,300
 I'm in sixth grade, people.

50
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,720
 So I got the eye patch and a sign that said "Kick me" to put on the back of me for when

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,220
 I went to school.

52
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,500
 Nobody's crushing it in sixth grade with a Dalmatian dog eye patch.

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:44,280
 But the result of that experience was that I developed what's known as an eye floater,

54
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,960
 which just means that I see black dots permanently in my right eye.

55
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,660
 And for the first year of having it, I genuinely just thought that there was always a mosquito

56
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,580
 around me, like there was literally for a year.

57
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:06,280
 I'd be sitting there and I'd be like, and I could never get it.

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,320
 And then I realized like this thing is here to stay.

59
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,560
 And then that one dot got a few more dot friends.

60
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,960
 And so now I kid you not, this has happened for decades now.

61
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:24,340
 The world that I know is a world with black dots right here.

62
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,820
 There's just a circle of black dots perpetually in my right eye.

63
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,920
 As far as I know, the world we live in is a world with black dots right here.

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,860
 That's the world that I know.

65
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,720
 And I haven't done a bunch of digging into it to know if I can do something about my

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
 eye floaters.

67
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,360
 As far as I know, there's nothing I can do.

68
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,100
 And I've just accepted the fact that this is who I am.

69
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,600
 This is the way it's going to be.

70
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,520
 And this will be my life.

71
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,120
 Now, that's fine.

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,160
 That type of mentality is fine when you're talking about seeing a few black dots in your

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
 right eye.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,400
 But it's not okay when you bring that mentality into the spiritual realm.

75
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,680
 See the reality is that many of us live with brokenness in our lives in the form of sin.

76
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,660
 And we believe the lie that, you know what, this is just who I am.

77
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,260
 This is just the way it's going to be.

78
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,280
 This is the world as I know it.

79
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,820
 And so many of us will go through life and we will believe a mentality that just is not

80
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,380
 congruent with who our Savior truly is.

81
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,000
 And so many of us live with this corrupt operating system that just says, you know what, this

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,280
 is just who I am.

83
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,760
 I'm just an insecure person.

84
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,080
 You know what, I'm just an angry person because of all that has happened to me.

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,880
 I just have a stronger sex drive than most other guys or most other girls.

86
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,480
 That's just who I am.

87
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,600
 I'm just not a disciplined person.

88
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,520
 I'm just not a confrontational person.

89
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,020
 I'm just an anxious personality.

90
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:16,960
 I just feel better when I'm in control.

91
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,620
 And so we allow that corrupt operating system to just quietly operate in the background

92
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
 of our lives.

93
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,000
 And so that is why pornography just moves in and makes itself at home.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,040
 That's why many of us lie or exaggerate or tell half-truths to make ourselves look better

95
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,660
 than we actually are.

96
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,880
 That's why many of us will manipulate guy after guy or girl after girl to kind of get

97
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,880
 something from them to make ourselves feel better about who we are.

98
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,980
 That's why many of us overeat or under eat or spend money that we don't actually have.

99
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,480
 It's because we buy into this mentality of this is just who I am.

100
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,220
 I'm just a stereotypical young adult.

101
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,300
 This is just the world that I know.

102
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,040
 This is just the way it has to be.

103
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:16,320
 See, it's good for us to remember that we all have an enemy.

104
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,560
 And the Bible refers to the enemy as the devil or Satan.

105
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,080
 But Jesus gives the devil a title.

106
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,560
 He's called the father of lies.

107
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:37,240
 Peter refers to him as a lion, a roaring lion prowling around seeking someone to devour.

108
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:46,800
 And what I need you to understand is our enemy's greatest accomplishment is getting us to accept

109
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,700
 defeat when Jesus Christ has already secured the victory.

110
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:00,240
 This is what is crazy, is we have an enemy and his greatest accomplishment is getting

111
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:08,880
 you and me to accept defeat when Jesus Christ has already secured the victory.

112
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,320
 Well how do we accept defeat?

113
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,080
 Well we accept defeat in the form of acquiescence.

114
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
 We acquiesce.

115
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,280
 This is just who I am.

116
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,720
 Change is not possible.

117
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:28,160
 And the life that I know is a life where this brokenness will just exist.

118
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,660
 As we step back into Psalm 23, we land now in verse 5.

119
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,040
 And I just want you to see what verse 5 says.

120
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,480
 Here's what it says.

121
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:47,760
 King David is writing and he says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."

122
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
 Isn't that interesting?

123
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,800
 He says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."

124
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,920
 The reason that you need to understand what's happening here is that this is actually a

125
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,900
 picture of a celebration of victory.

126
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,820
 And the reason that David says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies,"

127
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,960
 the reason that David's enemies are there is because they have been conquered.

128
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,160
 And so the enemies are forced to sit there at the feast and they have to watch David

129
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,920
 dine in triumph.

130
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,160
 So that's the picture here, is that David is experiencing victory in the presence of

131
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,320
 his enemies.

132
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,700
 And I believe that God wants you and I to experience the same thing.

133
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,240
 I believe that God wants you and I to walk in victory.

134
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
 Why?

135
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,600
 Because Jesus Christ already secured the victory for us through his death on a cross,

136
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,680
 burial in a tomb, and resurrection from the dead.

137
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,720
 So this is just a theology check.

138
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,760
 So for those of you who kind of theologically geek out, let's just make sure that your theology

139
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
 is intact.

140
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,200
 And for those of you who are like, "I don't even know what you're talking about right

141
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
 now.

142
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,080
 Like, this is a good chance for us to all get on the same page."

143
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:18,240
 It would be completely inaccurate to say that Jesus will win one day.

144
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:26,120
 It is actually inaccurate to even say Jesus is winning because the most true statement

145
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,640
 is Jesus Christ has already won.

146
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,520
 He's already won.

147
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,640
 Well how can I say that?

148
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,820
 Well listen to what the Apostle Paul says.

149
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:43,640
 In Colossians chapter 2 verse 15 he says, "And having disarmed the powers and authorities,

150
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,600
 he," that's Jesus, what did he do?

151
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 He made a public spectacle of them.

152
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,120
 Who are them?

153
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,940
 It's the powers and authorities.

154
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,840
 He's talking about Satan and all of his demonic forces.

155
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:03,840
 He's saying that Jesus made a public spectacle of our enemy.

156
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,000
 How?

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Triumphing over them by the cross.

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,840
 So when Jesus Christ went to the cross when he was crucified between two criminals, when

159
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,080
 he declared, "It is finished," what was finished?

160
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:24,000
 He was finished accomplishing God's will, reconciling a broken and busted humanity back

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
 to a perfect God.

162
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:33,400
 But not just that, it was finished triumphing over Satan's sin and death.

163
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,480
 Having a mockery of them.

164
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,960
 So you need to know our enemy has already lost.

165
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,200
 I said it a few weeks ago when March Madness was happening, but Satan now is just like

166
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,120
 the guy who's looking at the scoreboard and he knows he's already lost, but he's just

167
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,760
 going to foul as many times as he can on the way out.

168
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,820
 But he's already lost.

169
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,720
 Every act now of our enemy is just the act of a sore loser.

170
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,560
 And so here's what I want you to hear.

171
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,220
 Don't miss this.

172
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,780
 If you're tuned out, tune back in.

173
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,880
 All eyes on me right now.

174
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
 Okay?

175
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:20,120
 Jesus wants victory to be a normal part of reality for everyone who calls upon his name.

176
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,800
 Let me just say that again.

177
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:30,040
 Victory can and should be a normal part of reality for every follower of Jesus Christ.

178
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
 What am I saying?

179
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
 Here's what I'm saying.

180
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,760
 I'm saying that victory means change is possible.

181
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,420
 You and I can fight against sin and experience.

182
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,460
 We can take ground in our sin struggles.

183
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,220
 We can grow in Christlikeness.

184
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,080
 And so here's what I want you to think about.

185
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
 Okay?

186
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,420
 If you're here tonight and you consider yourself a follower of Jesus Christ, here's what I

187
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,780
 want to just ask you to decide right now in your own mind.

188
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:07,080
 When you think about following Jesus, which word right now pairs better for you with following

189
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,760
 Jesus?

190
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,000
 Failure or victory?

191
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,880
 Like when you think about your journey with Jesus, when you think about your life right

192
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,440
 now, which word pairs better for you when you think about following Jesus?

193
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,400
 Failure or victory?

194
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,180
 If for you it's the word failure, that's okay.

195
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,900
 I'm so glad you came tonight.

196
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:35,000
 This is actually a perfect night for you to come because failure doesn't have to be your

197
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,820
 final answer.

198
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,200
 And so here's what I want you to know.

199
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,580
 I want you to know that victory isn't just possible.

200
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,840
 Victory has already been purchased through Jesus's death on the cross and resurrection

201
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,500
 from the dead.

202
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,720
 And so what I want you to know tonight as we look into Psalm 23, there's going to be

203
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,320
 three things that you need if you're going to want, if there's going to be three things

204
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,660
 that you're going to need in your life if you're going to walk in Christ's victory.

205
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,660
 Here they are.

206
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,100
 Number one, you're going to need God's sight.

207
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,160
 Number two, you're going to need God's strength.

208
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,860
 And then number three, you're going to need God's spread.

209
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:24,040
 If you want to take a step towards victory, if you want to kind of abandon the broken

210
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,680
 and busted operating system that just says, "This is the way it has to be.

211
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
 This is just who I am.

212
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,140
 This is how my life is going to be," change is possible.

213
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,840
 Victory is on the table for you tonight, but you're going to need God's sight, God's strength,

214
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,080
 and God's spread.

215
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,160
 If you have a Bible, turn with me tonight to Psalm 23.

216
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,760
 Psalm 23 is where we have been.

217
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,080
 If this is your first time here, I'd encourage you to go back and check out the first three

218
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,680
 talks in the series, but we've been making our way just verse by verse through the Psalm.

219
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,040
 And David says this in chapter 23.

220
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,240
 He says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

221
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,700
 He makes me lie down in green pastures.

222
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,600
 He leads me beside still waters.

223
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,020
 He restores my soul.

224
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,720
 He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

225
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,680
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you

226
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,320
 are with me.

227
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

228
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,760
 And here it is, verse 5.

229
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,800
 "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

230
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,000
 You anoint my head with oil.

231
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,320
 My cup overflows."

232
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,800
 The first thing you're going to need if you're going to walk in Christ's victory is you're

233
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,840
 going to need God's sight.

234
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:51,840
 What I am talking about is I am talking about prescription lenses from God for your heart

235
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,400
 so that you can see God in yourself clearly.

236
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,480
 I don't know if you saw the transition in the text, but in Psalm 23, for the first four

237
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,000
 verses, David is referring to God as a shepherd and he's a sheep.

238
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,040
 But in verse 5, there's this pivot and David abandons the shepherd imagery and he picks

239
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,320
 up the imagery of God being a host.

240
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,040
 So God is host and David is honored guest.

241
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,080
 Here's why that's so important.

242
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,560
 In the ancient Near East, hospitality was so much more than it is today in the United

243
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,560
 States.

244
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,480
 Like in the United States, hospitality is just an elaborate charcuterie board with a

245
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,120
 mid-range bottle of wine.

246
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,880
 Like it was so much more than that in the ancient Near East.

247
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,780
 And if you came to stay with me in the ancient Near East, then here is what I was committing

248
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,880
 to do as your host.

249
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,600
 I was committing myself, taking full responsibility for two things.

250
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,440
 Number one, your safety, and number two, your satisfaction.

251
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,880
 For the entirety of your stay, I was responsible for your safety and your satisfaction.

252
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,080
 So for example, in the book of Genesis, there is this really weird and interesting story

253
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,800
 where these angels come to visit a guy named Lot in a town called Sodom.

254
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:25,360
 And the people of Sodom are crazy and they want to get access to these angels to harm

255
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
 them.

256
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:34,040
 And Lot is willing to sacrifice the safety of his own daughter in order to protect the

257
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,700
 two angels who are his guests.

258
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
 Why do I tell you that?

259
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,880
 Well, it shows that in the ancient Near East, you took hospitality very seriously.

260
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,200
 If you were the host, you were making a decision to take full responsibility for someone's

261
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,960
 safety, but not just that, their satisfaction.

262
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,660
 So a host would bring out their best meals.

263
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,040
 They would cook their best meals.

264
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,520
 They would spare no expense because they took full responsibility.

265
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,640
 So when David says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies, I want you

266
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,600
 to see how David is seeing."

267
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,000
 He is seeing things how God sees them.

268
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,560
 David looks and says, "God is host.

269
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,440
 I am honored guest."

270
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,160
 Like David is being invited to eat at the king's table and the king is throwing a banquet

271
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,880
 actually for David.

272
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:37,320
 And so the question that you need to answer is, is do you see life through God's sight?

273
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,500
 Do you have the right sight?

274
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,800
 Some of you guys, you wear contacts or glasses, like until you put your contacts in in the

275
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,780
 morning or until you put your glasses on, you cannot make sense of reality.

276
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,200
 Is that anyone in the room?

277
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,720
 Like you just, you might see blurry shapes, but otherwise you cannot make sense of reality.

278
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,200
 Well, you need to understand when it comes to life in the spiritual realm, every morning

279
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,720
 that you wake up, you have a choice to make whether you're going to put on God's lenses

280
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,580
 or you're going to put on some other lenses that are being handed to you by your enemy.

281
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,200
 So I do have glasses.

282
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,440
 I don't really wear them.

283
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,200
 That's a longer story, but these are my glasses.

284
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,620
 I've had them for about 13 years.

285
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,320
 And so I only wear these at night when I'm driving.

286
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:36,600
 But here's the reality, when I put them on, I can see clearly.

287
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,760
 They're doing their job.

288
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,500
 But today, Alex Hockett, a guy sitting right down here, he walked into the office I was

289
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,000
 in and he handed me these.

290
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,520
 I was like, "Well, where did these come from?"

291
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,760
 He was like, "I don't know.

292
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,600
 I just found them laying around."

293
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,160
 I was like, "Ew."

294
00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:01,760
 But anyway, here's the reality.

295
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,960
 When you put these on, life looks very different.

296
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,360
 Like the world that I now know is a life through a very distorted lens.

297
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,440
 And so you need to know you are either walking through life with a distorted understanding

298
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,880
 of reality or you are seeing things clearly, meaning you are seeing them through God's

299
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
 sight.

300
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,560
 And each morning, you have a choice which prescription lenses you're going to put on.

301
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,360
 So many of us, we wake up and we see life through the wrong lenses.

302
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,960
 And so we wake up and you know what we say?

303
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
 We say, "You know what?

304
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
 I am a failure.

305
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,560
 I'm probably going to fail again today.

306
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,300
 God's disappointed in me.

307
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:53,620
 God is watching me from heaven, hoping that I make better choices than I normally make.

308
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:59,640
 But the reality is, is that I'm just a stereotypical young adult and this is just who I am and

309
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:07,100
 this is just really how it's going to be and change really isn't possible."

310
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,900
 You have to choose whether you're going to live with those lenses or you're going to

311
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,740
 pick up God's lenses and you're going to put them on and you're going to see things more

312
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:21,620
 clearly and you're going to begin to see the reality that the one who already defeated

313
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,260
 Satan, sin, and death is your host.

314
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,500
 He's your host and you are his honored guest.

315
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,700
 You're not a stereotypical young adult.

316
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,820
 You are a guest of the King.

317
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,300
 You're his beloved child.

318
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,940
 He loves you.

319
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,100
 He's for you.

320
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,500
 He takes responsibility for your safety.

321
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,020
 Have you ever thought about God in that way?

322
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:58,780
 That because he is host, he takes full responsibility for your safety?

323
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,500
 He's already won and he wants his victory to be your victory today.

324
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,420
 And it's not just that Jesus did something.

325
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,100
 He is doing something today in your life.

326
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,940
 Like I don't know if you noticed, but in verse 5 when it says, "You prepare a table before

327
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,420
 me in the presence of my enemies.

328
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,080
 You anoint my head with oil.

329
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,660
 My cup overflows."

330
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,820
 All of the verbs belong to who in that verse?

331
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,380
 God.

332
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,620
 God.

333
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:41,340
 God is the one doing all of the activity in association with the celebration feast in

334
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,900
 the presence of David's enemies.

335
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,100
 God is responsible for all of the activity.

336
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,260
 And yet so many of us wake up and we're like, "You know what?

337
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:59,180
 God's looking down from heaven and he's watching me hoping I make, I do the right thing.

338
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:07,960
 So I'm going to try hard for God and yet it's probably not going to go well."

339
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,300
 God already did something and God is doing something.

340
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,740
 That's why Paul in 1 Corinthians 10.13 is able to say, "No temptation has overtaken

341
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
 you.

342
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,740
 That's not common to me."

343
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,740
 And God is faithful.

344
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
 Watch this.

345
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,740
 Here's what God is doing.

346
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,140
 God is faithful.

347
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,840
 He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation, he will

348
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,680
 also provide the way of escape that you may be able to endure it.

349
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,360
 Do you realize that?

350
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:45,240
 Anytime you're attempted, anytime you're attempted, God's like, "Hey, there's a way out."

351
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,020
 Like it might just flash into your mind, like for a split second, you're like, "No thanks.

352
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,960
 I'll do this."

353
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,320
 But there is always a way of escape because God is doing something and he is a good host

354
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,380
 who takes full responsibility for your life.

355
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,580
 You have to begin to wake up.

356
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,820
 Every morning you need to know you're going to wake up and you're going to be fumbling

357
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
 around.

358
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,260
 You're going to be feeling around for, "For what lenses am I going to put on today?"

359
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:18,800
 And you need to know that you have an enemy who's like, "This one."

360
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:28,000
 And so you have to wake up and you have to begin to see things through God's sight.

361
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,100
 I battled pornography for seven years.

362
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
 Seven years.

363
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,660
 Pornography was a big part of my story, especially in college.

364
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,560
 And there was a breaking moment in my life where God just reached in and said, "We're

365
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,580
 going to be done with this."

366
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,600
 And you know what it required of me?

367
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,720
 It required of me to wake up each morning.

368
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,420
 I woke up and I began to pray the same thing over and over.

369
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,880
 I began to wake up and I used to say, "God, I pray that today your standard of purity

370
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,840
 would become my standard of purity.

371
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:07,100
 Lord, I pray that today you would fill me with your Spirit that I might bear the fruit

372
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
 of self-control.

373
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:15,260
 And God, when I am tempted today, will you help me to see the way of escape and to take

374
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,700
 it?"

375
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:24,500
 And one day turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, months turned into years.

376
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,100
 But it started with waking up and putting on God's lenses.

377
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,220
 You're going to need God's sight if you're going to walk in Christ's victory, number

378
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
 two.

379
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,660
 You're going to need God's strength if you're going to walk in victory.

380
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,020
 You're going to need God's strength.

381
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,660
 David says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."

382
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,620
 Watch this, "You anoint my head with oil."

383
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,860
 Some of you young adults who are already into essential oils, like you claim this verse

384
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,940
 is like your life verse.

385
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,700
 You're like, "Yes, God, you anoint my head with essential oils."

386
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:05,160
 It's not what it says.

387
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:13,380
 But in the ancient world, a host might greet someone and anoint their guest with oil on

388
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,380
 their forehead.

389
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,620
 And when they would do that, you know what it would do is it would create a glossy sheen

390
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:25,180
 on someone's face, it would change their countenance, and it might even give their body a fragrance.

391
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:30,300
 Figuratively speaking, to be anointed with oil, it carried the idea of God's blessing

392
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,860
 or favor.

393
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,920
 So for those of you in the room who are familiar with the life of David, can you think of another

394
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,880
 time when David's head was anointed with oil?

395
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,420
 It was when he was a teenager and he was anointed as king.

396
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:51,260
 And I want to draw a connection for you between oil and one other thing.

397
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:56,860
 First Samuel 16, 13 says this, "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him," that's

398
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,540
 David, "in the midst of his brothers."

399
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,460
 Watch this, "and the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward, and Samuel

400
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,100
 rose up and went to Ramah."

401
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,420
 Here's what I want you to see, there's a connection even in the Old Testament between oil and

402
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,800
 the Spirit of God.

403
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,740
 When David's head is anointed with oil, what rushes upon him?

404
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,580
 The Spirit of God.

405
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:23,420
 Oil was a symbol for the favor of God, and God's favor manifested itself in the Spirit

406
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,540
 of God rushing upon David.

407
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,900
 I want you to fast forward to today.

408
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,700
 Jesus Christ has come, He has died, He has risen, He ascended into heaven, and who did

409
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,980
 Jesus send?

410
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,820
 He sent the Helper, the Comforter, the Counselor, the Holy Spirit.

411
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,100
 If you put your trust in Jesus, do you know who lives inside of you?

412
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,140
 The Spirit of God lives inside of you.

413
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:54,820
 I cannot think of a better way that God can display His favor upon us.

414
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:00,820
 Can't think of a better way that our lives can be transformed, our countenances change,

415
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,180
 our character smells differently.

416
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,260
 Why?

417
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:11,180
 Than being anointed with the oil that is the presence of the Spirit of God living inside

418
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,940
 of us.

419
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,700
 Now the reason that I said that if you want to walk in Christ's victory, you're going

420
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,940
 to need God's strength.

421
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,220
 Here's why I said that.

422
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,020
 Let me just, watch this, follow me on this.

423
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,540
 Watch the argument that I'm making.

424
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:35,020
 Listen to what Ephesians chapter 1 verses 18 through 20 say.

425
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,980
 Paul says, "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know

426
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,980
 the hope to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in His holy people,"

427
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:53,260
 verse 19, "and His incomparably great power for us who believe."

428
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:59,260
 That power is the same as the mighty strength He, God exerted when He raised Christ from

429
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,660
 the dead and seated Him at the right hand in the heavenly realms.

430
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,060
 So do you see what Paul's saying?

431
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:09,420
 Paul is saying, "Look, as a follower of Jesus Christ, I want you to experience the power

432
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,740
 of God.

433
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,920
 It's an incomparably great power, and it's the same power that raised Christ from the

434
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,740
 dead.

435
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,660
 Where does that power come from?"

436
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,740
 Romans chapter 8 verse 11, watch this.

437
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:38,420
 "If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ

438
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:43,140
 Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through the Spirit who

439
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,140
 dwells in you."

440
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,140
 So do you make the connection?

441
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,660
 Paul is like, "Look, I want you to know the power that raised Christ from the dead."

442
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,680
 And then he says in Romans, "You know what that power is?

443
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,020
 It's the Spirit of God, and that Spirit actually lives in you."

444
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,380
 So please don't miss what I'm telling you.

445
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,220
 If you want to walk in victory, then you have to get your mind around this.

446
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,000
 Don't miss it.

447
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,820
 The same power that raised Christ from the dead is living inside of you right now.

448
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,180
 Have you ever thought about that?

449
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,540
 Like have you ever just made that mental shift and realized that the Spirit of God doesn't

450
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:29,380
 live in you passively?

451
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:36,060
 Like the Spirit has purpose in your life, and one of those purposes is for you to know

452
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:44,900
 the same power that raised Christ from the dead in a very personal way.

453
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,700
 It's an incomparably great power.

454
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,600
 Nothing rivals it.

455
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,620
 Nothing can stand against it.

456
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:57,380
 No addiction, no lies from the enemy telling you that you're a failure or you're worthless

457
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,500
 or you're never enough.

458
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,860
 No hurt, no heartache, no anger, no bitterness, no resentment.

459
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,980
 Nothing can stand up against the same power that raised Christ from the dead.

460
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:14,580
 That's why Paul is able to say in Galatians 5:16, "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not

461
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,760
 gratify the desires of the flesh."

462
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,780
 He's able to say confidently, "Look, walk by the Spirit."

463
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:26,380
 That word "walk" it implies a consistent dependence.

464
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:31,660
 Walk by the Spirit, and I can confidently tell you, you will not gratify the desires

465
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,700
 of the flesh.

466
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,700
 You'll experience victory.

467
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:42,540
 I've used this illustration before, but several years ago I was watching this game show, and

468
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,780
 this game show, it was just a bunch of obstacle courses, so contestants would run these obstacle

469
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,780
 courses and compete to win.

470
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:57,220
 There was this one obstacle course, I'll never forget this, there was this point in the course

471
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:05,100
 where there were four different doorways, and the doorways were covered by paper.

472
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,700
 So the thought was that contestants would run and just kind of eenie, meenie, miney,

473
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,780
 moe the four doorways and pick one and run and burst through the paper and keep going.

474
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:23,900
 The only catch was that behind three of the four doorways were wooden beams.

475
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:34,420
 So what you saw was contestant after contestant run up, hope for the best, pick a doorway,

476
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:42,320
 burst through paper, and experience massive amounts of regret and shame.

477
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,620
 But then I began to notice that there were a few contestants that figured it out, because

478
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,700
 when they got to that point in the course, instead of just kind of hoping for the best,

479
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,140
 picking one and going for it, you know what they would do?

480
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,020
 Is they would stop and just start staring.

481
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,700
 Because what they realized is if they waited long enough, the sunlight would hit the paper

482
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:11,300
 and illuminate which ways led to death and which way led to joy and peace.

483
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:21,340
 And I tell you that just to say the Spirit of God is the light that shines in our lives

484
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,140
 and makes known to us the path of life.

485
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:31,780
 And He's committed to leading us in the ways that lead to joy and peace.

486
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:41,380
 And He's trying to steer us away from the paths that will lead to shame and regret.

487
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,700
 That's what He wants to do.

488
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,980
 He is resurrection power living inside of you.

489
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,780
 If you want to walk in Christ's victory, you are going to need God's strength.

490
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:55,900
 So let me just ask you, if you're in the fight right now, if you feel like you are fighting

491
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,660
 a losing battle, if the word failure feels like it connects more for you than victory,

492
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,780
 then let me just ask you, when is the last time you got on your knees and begged God

493
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,580
 for resurrection power in your life?

494
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,780
 Like when's the last time you said, "Holy Spirit, I know you live in me.

495
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:21,140
 I beg you for the same power that raised Christ from the dead to do something in me.

496
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,780
 Change the way I think.

497
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,100
 Change the way that I operate.

498
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,740
 Change my desires.

499
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,260
 Do a work in me.

500
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,900
 Regardless, would you give me the strength that I need today, the love, the joy, the

501
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:41,140
 peace, the patience, the kindness, the gentleness, the faithfulness, and the self-control today

502
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:50,380
 to walk on the path that is most glorifying to Christ because you live in me?"

503
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:55,180
 Here's what you need to understand, though.

504
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,540
 Walking implies consistent reliance.

505
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,380
 It's not just a one-time deal.

506
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,580
 Like we're talking moment by moment.

507
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:09,340
 Ephesians 5.18 says, "Don't get drunk with wine, for that's debauchery, but be filled

508
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
 with the Spirit."

509
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,340
 That's what alcohol is doing.

510
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,100
 He's saying, "Hey, look at what it's like when you're drunk.

511
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
 What happens when you're drunk?

512
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,100
 You're controlled by alcohol.

513
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,780
 It affects the way that you think, the way you talk, the way you act."

514
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:23,180
 He's like, "Yeah, take that analogy and apply it to the Spirit.

515
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,780
 You want to be controlled by the Spirit like alcohol would control a drunk person.

516
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,620
 You want to be controlled in such a way that it changes the way that you think, the way

517
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,580
 that you talk, the way that you act.

518
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:43,180
 But in order for you to be controlled by the Spirit, you have to relinquish control.

519
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,900
 And that requires surrender, where you wake up and say, "My way is wrong.

520
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,240
 Your way is right.

521
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
 Your way is good.

522
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
 My way is wrong.

523
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,480
 Your way is the best way.

524
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,020
 I will go with you."

525
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,920
 And then really the question you have to answer is, "Do you really want to change?"

526
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,860
 Think honestly, do you really want to change?

527
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,500
 Because if the Spirit of God goes to work and unleashes resurrection power in your life,

528
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:18,780
 it's going to be amazing, but things are going to change.

529
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,820
 And that might change what you do on the weekends.

530
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,100
 That might change your relationship status.

531
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,980
 That might change where you work.

532
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,580
 That could change all sorts of things.

533
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,740
 So the real question is, do you really want to change?

534
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,700
 If so, the good news is that you have God's sight and God's strength available to you

535
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,980
 today.

536
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,140
 But if you want to walk in Christ's victory, you don't just need God's sight and God's

537
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,020
 strength, you're going to need God's spread.

538
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,220
 What do I mean by God's spread?

539
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,940
 That feels a little weird.

540
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,140
 Here's what I mean.

541
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,900
 David finishes verse 5, he says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

542
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,380
 You anoint my head with oil.

543
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,900
 My cup overflows."

544
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,460
 So the picture here is of a banquet feast.

545
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:08,000
 Just imagine the best foods, God's spread, like God playing the menu.

546
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,040
 God made the food.

547
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
 He brought it.

548
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,860
 It's going to be the best.

549
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,540
 He says, "My cup overflows."

550
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:21,740
 It's just a picture of God continually topping off David's chalice so that David is constantly

551
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,060
 satisfied.

552
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,560
 He is always fully satisfied.

553
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,060
 So here's what you need to know.

554
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,500
 If you want to go on the offense against your sin, if you want to go on the offense, then

555
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,020
 by far the best thing you can do is enjoy God and all of His provisions every single

556
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,560
 day.

557
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,220
 Enjoy God and all of His provisions.

558
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:47,740
 It's to sit with Jesus and His Word every day until you have tasted and seen that He

559
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
 is good.

560
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,220
 Because here's the deal.

561
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,360
 The more you enjoy God, the more difficult it is to enjoy sin.

562
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,660
 It is very difficult to enjoy God completely and enjoy sin completely at the exact same

563
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:06,260
 time because the more you realize that you have in God, the less you feel like you need

564
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,460
 from sin.

565
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,180
 But here's what you need to understand.

566
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,700
 You know what your enemy capitalizes on?

567
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:21,740
 Our enemy capitalizes on perceived need, perceived hungers.

568
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,540
 So you hunger to feel enough?

569
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,180
 Well compare yourself to others.

570
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,420
 Busy yourself to the point that you're too busy for Jesus.

571
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,620
 If you hunger for approval, this is a big one for me.

572
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:40,820
 Then become who someone else wants you to be and stop being who God made you to be.

573
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,860
 If you hunger for control, fine.

574
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,900
 Manipulate your friends and family members.

575
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,620
 Manipulate your diet in an unhealthy way.

576
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,900
 Transform yourself, turn to pornography so that you can feel in control.

577
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:58,580
 If you hunger for love, choose lust, compromise, date the wrong guy or girl.

578
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,520
 It's easier that way.

579
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,780
 You hunger for security?

580
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,500
 Then don't trust God.

581
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
 Don't walk in faith.

582
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,940
 Accommodate all your fears in life.

583
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,300
 You hunger for justice?

584
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,060
 Anger, bitterness, and resentment are your right.

585
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,820
 See, our enemy capitalizes on perceived hungers.

586
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,380
 And here's the crazy thing.

587
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:32,140
 Our tendency is to run to the world looking for what we already freely have in Jesus Christ.

588
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:38,540
 Our tendency is to run to the world looking for what we already have freely in Jesus Christ.

589
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,700
 I just want you to think about this.

590
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,620
 What's your favorite restaurant in Dallas?

591
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,820
 Okay, for me, my favorite restaurant is probably a place called Ucci.

592
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,440
 It might be a place called Hillstone.

593
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,820
 Both of those that kind of go back and forth for me.

594
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
 Love both of them.

595
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,820
 Okay?

596
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,380
 I don't know what it is for you, but here's what I want you to imagine.

597
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,580
 If I were to invite you over to my house for dinner, and whatever your favorite restaurant

598
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,300
 is, what if I told you, "Hey, I'm catering it in.

599
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
 I'm bringing it in.

600
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,420
 All of your favorite dishes, they're going to be this massive spread from your favorite

601
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:11,340
 restaurant that the place that you enjoy the most, I'm having it for you."

602
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,700
 Now can you imagine being at my house with your favorite meals in front of you, and you

603
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:21,980
 excusing yourself and going out into my alley and starting to dig through my trash looking

604
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,980
 for something to eat?

605
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,540
 Wouldn't that feel crazy?

606
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:35,740
 And yet we do it all the time in the spiritual realm.

607
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:42,740
 Yet we have everything our souls long for freely in the person of Jesus Christ, and

608
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:52,500
 yet we run to the world looking, digging through trash cans looking for spiritual scraps.

609
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,140
 And so let me just remind you of what the good news of Christianity is.

610
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,980
 Here is the gospel.

611
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,900
 The gospel of Christianity is this.

612
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:07,740
 Jesus drank the cup of wrath so that we could drink the cup of God's blessing.

613
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,260
 Jesus drank the cup of wrath.

614
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,820
 When He went to the cross, He was crucified for your sins and mine.

615
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,420
 He was punished for your sins and for mine.

616
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,420
 He drank the cup of God's wrath.

617
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,860
 Why?

618
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:25,940
 So we could drink the cup of God's blessing, that we could know Jesus, and we could be

619
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:34,580
 satisfied by Jesus now and forevermore.

620
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,380
 If you're hungry for justice, Romans 12, 19 says, "Beloved, never avenge yourselves.

621
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,420
 Leave it to the wrath of God, for it's written, 'Vengeance is mine.

622
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,340
 I will repay,' says the Lord."

623
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,340
 He's got you.

624
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:51,020
 If you hunger for control or security, Colossians 1, 17 says, "He, Jesus, is before all things,

625
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,420
 and in Him all things hold together."

626
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:58,060
 If you hunger for love, 1 John 3, 1 says, "See what kind of love the Father has given

627
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,860
 to us, that we should be called children of God."

628
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:09,060
 If you need to feel enough, if you're longing for approval, 2 Corinthians 5, 21 tells us,

629
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:15,260
 "For our sake He, God, made Jesus to be sin, who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become

630
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,740
 the righteousness of God."

631
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,500
 What does that mean?

632
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,460
 It means that the God of the universe would look at us and say, "You're enough, not because

633
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,980
 of anything you've done, but because of what Christ has done for you.

634
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:32,500
 He has made you enough when you could never be enough."

635
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,220
 You have all the enoughness, all the approval that you need in Jesus.

636
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,860
 And so one of the greatest misunderstandings when we feel like we're walking in failure

637
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:46,220
 is we look at God and we're like, "God, I need you to do more for me.

638
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,900
 I need more strength from you.

639
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,700
 I need more help from you."

640
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:58,220
 But here's the reality, you don't need more from God, you just need more of God.

641
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,180
 Because everything that you need, everything that your soul truly longs for, it's found

642
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,260
 in the person of Jesus Christ.

643
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:11,460
 And here's the reality, if Jesus Christ cannot satisfy your soul, I assure you nothing else

644
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,380
 can.

645
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,260
 Just try me on that.

646
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:23,060
 If Jesus Christ cannot satisfy your soul, I promise you nothing else will.

647
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:29,420
 So I'll just end by asking you, moving forward, when you leave this place tonight, which word

648
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,940
 will better associate for you with following Jesus?

649
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,020
 Will it be failure or victory?

650
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,900
 Good news is Jesus Christ has already won.

651
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,780
 You have everything you need to walk in victory.

652
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:52,220
 You have God's sight, you have God's strength, and God's spread.

653
00:43:52,220 --> 00:44:05,140
 Let's pray together.

654
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:12,100
 If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ, you're realizing

655
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,660
 right now that your soul has been made for Him.

656
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:21,060
 You have been made for Jesus Christ.

657
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:28,300
 And Jesus Christ came and died and rose from the dead to bring you into right relationship

658
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,100
 with God.

659
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:35,620
 If you want to begin a relationship with Jesus Christ tonight, then I just invite you in

660
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:41,100
 this moment to pray and say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life?

661
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,900
 Would you forgive me of my sins?

662
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,940
 Thank you that you died on the cross for me.

663
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,700
 Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

664
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,180
 Would you come into my life?

665
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,060
 Would you forgive me of my sins?

666
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,500
 And would you lead me in a new life?"

667
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,380
 And if you're here tonight and you already know Jesus, then let me just encourage you,

668
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,580
 do business with the Lord now.

669
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,020
 Don't wait until you leave.

670
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:19,980
 Like if you've been wearing the wrong lenses, lenses of failure, then take them off and

671
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,460
 invite God's perspective that He's your host, you're His honored guest.

672
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:28,700
 He takes responsibility for your safety.

673
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:34,020
 Maybe you just get on your knees and you beg God to unleash resurrection power in your

674
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,340
 life through the presence of His Spirit.

675
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:42,920
 Or maybe you just need to sit and taste and see that God is good, that you just sit here

676
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:50,380
 tonight until you begin to taste God's goodness, that it would be satisfying to your soul.

677
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,500
 Lord Jesus, we need you.

678
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,500
 We love you.

679
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,480
 We believe that there is no one greater than you.

680
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:05,660
 You are the one we have been made for, God, so I pray that tonight you would do a miraculous

681
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,020
 work in each of our lives.

682
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,100
 Speak to our hearts.

683
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,100
 We need you.

684
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,820
 In Jesus' name.

685
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:20,820
