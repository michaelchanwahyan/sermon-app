1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
 Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,740
 (congregation cheering)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,700
 Hey there, my name is Garrett,

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,880
 and I served on the porch staff team here for six years.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,480
 And then two years ago, if you're in the room live,

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,580
 you heard David say just a moment ago,

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,540
 two years ago that my wife Gabby and I

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,940
 left Dallas-Fort Worth,

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,480
 which has been our home for quite a while,

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,860
 and moved to New York City to begin a new church

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,180
 that launches this very month.

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,180
 So we're very excited about that.

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,500
 But here's the interesting thing about tonight

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,360
 is that I haven't been here in two years,

15
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,560
 and research has shown that the porch crowd

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,200
 kind of almost does a full turnover about every two years,

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,760
 which leaves me tonight starting by saying,

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,900
 it's so good to see you guys.

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,700
 And it leaves you saying, you too.

20
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,540
 Who is that?

21
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,380
 (congregation laughing)

22
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,380
 And, but in any case, it's so good.

23
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,740
 It's so good to be together

24
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,240
 and just to have a few moments of potential

25
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,580
 for God to move in our lives and hearts together.

26
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,720
 Special shout out tonight, by the way,

27
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,180
 to our friends in Boise

28
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,380
 and our friends in Scottsdale

29
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,220
 who are tuning in around the country.

30
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,360
 Some of them are not around the country.

31
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,260
 Some of my thinkers are sitting right over there,

32
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,720
 I think is what's going on.

33
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,700
 So it's great to be together.

34
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,620
 Listen, I'd love to start,

35
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,020
 I'd love to start with a question tonight.

36
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,900
 Tonight's about mission.

37
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,000
 It's about being united in mission, specifically.

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,940
 I'm gonna ask you a question.

39
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,260
 Maybe you've never reflected on this before.

40
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,700
 Maybe you have, but here it comes.

41
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,940
 What causes a person's life mission?

42
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,140
 And when I say mission tonight,

43
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,180
 I don't mean, when I say a person's life mission,

44
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,580
 I don't mean like their mood.

45
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,780
 Like, you know, I'm on a mission to get some tacos today.

46
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,340
 That's not a mission, that's a mood.

47
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,780
 Okay, that's a desire, that's a want.

48
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,460
 That can come and go, okay?

49
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,460
 I'm talking about a deep seated drive.

50
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,320
 When I say your personal life mission,

51
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,160
 I'm talking about a deep seated thing that makes you tick.

52
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,400
 It makes you go, season by season,

53
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,600
 week after week, year after year.

54
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,260
 It is your inner posture

55
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,900
 and set of desires and orientation.

56
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,000
 I'm talking about the depths of you and your wants.

57
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
 That's what I'm talking about

58
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,300
 when I say a personal life mission.

59
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,580
 What causes that to change dramatically

60
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,920
 from themselves to God?

61
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,480
 Because that does happen sometimes, right?

62
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,880
 How does a person go, and self can look in any way.

63
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,080
 When I say their life mission being themselves,

64
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,920
 that can look like anything.

65
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,460
 That can look like chasing options, money, power,

66
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,620
 pleasure, freedom, control, family, sex, achievement.

67
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,660
 But underneath all those many diverse options,

68
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,600
 it is an expression of the self as mission.

69
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,760
 Maybe even self improvement, a future version of the self.

70
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,580
 How can it be that a person's inner life mission

71
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,380
 can go from totally self-oriented,

72
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,380
 totally locked into the mirror, if you will,

73
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,480
 the metaphorical mirror, to becoming about God,

74
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,920
 essentially a mission to give the life away,

75
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,220
 voluntarily just to give it away.

76
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,380
 How does that change happen?

77
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,520
 And by way of introduction tonight,

78
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,880
 since I'm aware most of us have not met,

79
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,760
 I wanna tell you this shift of mission

80
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,660
 actually took place to me, in my life, in my heart.

81
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,400
 And I can't show you a picture

82
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,960
 that really captures a life mission

83
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,200
 because we don't usually have our life's mission

84
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,560
 tattooed on our forehead.

85
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,940
 But if I could show a before and after

86
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,700
 of a life mission photo, this would be pretty much it.

87
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,040
 I ask you to be gracious.

88
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,380
 Yeah, here it is.

89
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,240
 So the guy on the, the guy on the left,

90
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,380
 they told me this was a safe place.

91
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,220
 It feels like it's room of judgment right now, okay?

92
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,320
 Listen, the guy on the left is a teenager in 2005.

93
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,420
 You see the shell necklace.

94
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,900
 And so this is not one, but two, as a matter of fact.

95
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,660
 So try to get past the surface for a second.

96
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,700
 And like, I wanna take you inside the mind of this person

97
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,800
 because I lived with him 24 hours a day.

98
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,500
 And I can assure you that this person

99
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,140
 wants to live for himself.

100
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,740
 His life's mission is indeed fully and utterly himself.

101
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,320
 There is no bigger joy than himself.

102
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,280
 There is no, the world's not bigger than himself.

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
 His biggest joy is sexual adventure on the weekends

104
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,020
 with little regard for the cost.

105
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,980
 He is addicted to the party.

106
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,180
 He is addicted to attention.

107
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,220
 He's addicted to athletics and promiscuity,

108
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,520
 really just more outlets for himself.

109
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,660
 He's a shameless narcissist, by the way.

110
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,000
 And if you're thinking right now,

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,900
 man, Garrett, maybe you're being a little hard on yourself.

112
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,600
 Oh, I assure you, I'm being a little easy on myself.

113
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,300
 You just got the edited version, okay?

114
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,040
 I could bring people in here to let you know

115
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,700
 that I just gave you the sanitized version

116
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,580
 of how I was living prior to about the age of 20, okay?

117
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,020
 So that's a person who I know good and well

118
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,020
 was thoroughly engaged in a life mission for the self.

119
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,960
 Now, this person on the right, this is a 30-year-old.

120
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,120
 And this is us with everything we own in a U-Haul.

121
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,820
 And we are on the way to New York City

122
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,960
 to begin, of all things, a church.

123
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,960
 This person, while still oft wrong,

124
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,760
 often mistaken, often misled, and thoroughly imperfect,

125
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,600
 this person's deepest desires have changed.

126
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,000
 This person wants at a base level

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,800
 to live for something more.

128
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,040
 This person wants not to live for himself.

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,440
 This person wants to make life count.

130
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,980
 The fear is not missing out on the weekend

131
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,380
 or some exploit of the weekend.

132
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
 The fear is wasting the life

133
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,320
 and making it not count for something ultimate.

134
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,020
 The entire life mission under the surface

135
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,220
 of these people have changed.

136
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,820
 And I just wanna ask you, how can this be?

137
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,060
 The person on the left is a mission field.

138
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,000
 That means a person that other people pray for and go,

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,860
 "God, I just wish you'd get Garrett's attention.

140
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,800
 "Please bring him to his knees

141
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,440
 "and show him that he needs you."

142
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,240
 You know, like that person is a mission field.

143
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,840
 The person on the right is a missionary.

144
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,200
 That means I'm now the person that's like,

145
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,680
 "Oh God, will you get someone's attention?

146
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,740
 "Will you just bring them to their knees

147
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,080
 "and just show them that they need you?"

148
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,880
 I now pray the prayers for other people

149
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,580
 that people used to pray for me

150
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,080
 because I went from being a mission field to a missionary

151
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,620
 because my life mission went from myself to God.

152
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,280
 That's a real change that I underwent in my life.

153
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,360
 And what I wanna ask you to reflect on for a second is,

154
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,120
 how does that happen?

155
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,100
 Because it might happen to you, right?

156
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,960
 How does this actually take place?

157
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,060
 Some people try to explain this

158
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,260
 in all kinds of natural ways.

159
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,100
 You know this, right?

160
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,940
 Some people would say,

161
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,060
 "Well, maybe you just grew up."

162
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,400
 But no, that can't quite cover it

163
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,240
 because guess what?

164
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,940
 There's no magic age you cross

165
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,240
 to where you just decide, "You know what?

166
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,180
 "I've had enough of me and I'm gonna live for God."

167
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,480
 We all, there's such a thing as a selfish 70, 80,

168
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,740
 90 year old, that's a thing, right?

169
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,740
 So there's no magic number that where you just graduate

170
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,580
 from living for yourself.

171
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,720
 So it can't be just age.

172
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
 And some people would say,

173
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,380
 "Well, you know what?

174
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,220
 "You're a pastor

175
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,120
 "and we can just give you a category to you.

176
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,460
 "And that's just what pastors do is live for God."

177
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,800
 But wait, you have to start to live for God

178
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,460
 as a mission before you become a pastor.

179
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,760
 You don't hire someone as a pastor

180
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,600
 who doesn't live for God,

181
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,840
 hoping they like change their mind.

182
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,800
 You see what I'm saying?

183
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,540
 So it had to come first.

184
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,300
 The desire to live for God had to come first.

185
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,140
 Someone would say,

186
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,300
 "Ah, I think the answer was right there

187
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,580
 "in that picture to your left."

188
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,540
 You probably married like a super Christian woman

189
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,640
 and just like had to like clean it up.

190
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,580
 Well, she is a committed Christian,

191
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,840
 but that's not the primary influence.

192
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,640
 I started to walk with God before we got married.

193
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,480
 Someone would say,

194
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,320
 "You know what?

195
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,160
 "I can explain this.

196
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,980
 "You know what happened to you?

197
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,120
 "You made like a new year's resolution.

198
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
 "You just like woke up one day

199
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,460
 "and you're the one guy for whom it worked."

200
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,360
 But here's the thing, discipline can't do it.

201
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,520
 Discipline can only support the mission you already have.

202
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,500
 It can't change you from the outside in.

203
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,460
 That's not the way it works.

204
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,840
 A change of mission comes from the inside out.

205
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,500
 So it can't just be that I woke up one day

206
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,300
 and wanted to get serious about life.

207
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,140
 Somebody would say,

208
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,980
 "You know what, bro?

209
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,800
 "I don't know.

210
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,640
 "Look, maybe you went bald

211
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,480
 "and God was your only option."

212
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,300
 You know what I'm saying?

213
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,940
 Like, I don't know what happened to you,

214
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,340
 but good for you.

215
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,440
 And you know what?

216
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,040
 Whatever happened, I don't know,

217
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,320
 but whatever happened, it was rare, it was weird.

218
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,820
 So I'm safe.

219
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,120
 And I wanna tell you, that's exactly my point.

220
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,020
 It's not weird and it's not rare.

221
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,260
 It's happening to people on your row.

222
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,960
 People in this room by the hundreds

223
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,660
 and in fact by the thousands

224
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,440
 are experiencing a change of desire to live for them.

225
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,400
 This is happening in real time.

226
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,240
 This is happening weekly.

227
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,060
 This is happening in your city.

228
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,540
 This is happening right now

229
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,600
 that people are actually experiencing

230
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,540
 a major and radical shift in real time

231
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,820
 from living for themselves to living for God.

232
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,740
 It can happen to them.

233
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,020
 It can happen to you.

234
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,080
 And you know this is true.

235
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,260
 I'll just make up a person that I haven't met tonight,

236
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,460
 but I know is in this room

237
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,380
 and you know they are too.

238
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,220
 So here they come.

239
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,720
 He's 31 years old.

240
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,160
 And six months ago, he lived for his career.

241
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,100
 And he was determined to get all his identity

242
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,920
 from his career.

243
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,460
 He's climbing the corporate ladder.

244
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,200
 He was gonna make millionaire by 30,

245
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,460
 didn't quite get there, but you know what?

246
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,760
 There's always early retirement

247
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,540
 and he is going to double down and make it.

248
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,100
 And his journey is in the past is approximately this.

249
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,180
 He went to the ball field as a little boy to get identity

250
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,140
 and he didn't get it.

251
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,140
 And then as an adolescent,

252
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,080
 he went to the bedroom to get identity

253
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,920
 and he didn't get it.

254
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,280
 And now he's gonna try the boardroom.

255
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,180
 And if he can get power from the company,

256
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,620
 that somehow is going to,

257
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,160
 he's gonna worship his resume now.

258
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,920
 And now he hasn't noticed yet

259
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,160
 that the target keeps changing

260
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,360
 and he's chasing a mirage

261
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,000
 and his identity can only come from God.

262
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,220
 And that's where he was living a few months ago.

263
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,260
 But now there's an after.

264
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,440
 It's different.

265
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,700
 And his parents have noticed.

266
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,960
 He can't stop for some reason hanging around church.

267
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,240
 And all of a sudden as he does his work,

268
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,840
 he's calm because his identity isn't attached

269
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,780
 to his performance anymore.

270
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,040
 And all of a sudden,

271
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,080
 he doesn't worship some future version of himself

272
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,280
 in a corner office.

273
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,520
 He worships God and does his work from a state of peace.

274
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,320
 And all of a sudden the person he's dating is like,

275
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,620
 I think I'm dating someone else

276
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,120
 than the person I started dating

277
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,220
 because a change has radically happened

278
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,220
 in such a person's life.

279
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,700
 That's happening all over this room.

280
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,200
 Did you know that?

281
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,900
 I'll make up one more.

282
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,660
 Here's a girl, 26 years old, six months ago,

283
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,500
 is looking back on her previous five years.

284
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,460
 And you know what she sees?

285
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,640
 Guy A in her, guy B in her,

286
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,740
 guy C in her, guy D in her.

287
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,180
 They all have in common a guy in her

288
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,740
 because that was her mission.

289
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,840
 But now all of a sudden,

290
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,080
 all of a sudden, a radical change has happened.

291
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
 She seems to operate from confidence.

292
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,920
 She doesn't seem to operate

293
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,480
 as a person who is easily fooled or foolish.

294
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,680
 She has a sense of peace.

295
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,620
 She seems to draw her sense of self,

296
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,460
 not from who's beside her, but who is above her.

297
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,620
 And no one knows, like,

298
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,720
 this transformation has taken place.

299
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
 How can this be?

300
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,060
 It's happening on your row.

301
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,000
 And I just wanna preach tonight

302
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,360
 in a way that invites you, invites you,

303
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,900
 not to see what causes that kind of a change, but who.

304
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,240
 Because ultimately,

305
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,640
 behind every one of these changes is a who.

306
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,980
 And the hero of all this is not the change itself.

307
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,440
 It's not the changed people.

308
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
 It is the who that does the changing

309
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,480
 and the mission that he directs us to.

310
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,720
 I just wanna invite you.

311
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,480
 I wanna invite you to give your life away tonight.

312
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
 So I have a humble goal.

313
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
 Just give your life away.

314
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,060
 That's all I'm after.

315
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,500
 I want you to leverage your life for something that counts.

316
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,160
 And I know in a room this big,

317
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,520
 I know some of you are just unavailable.

318
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,260
 You are mid-self mission.

319
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,940
 And I just, I know, I've lived it.

320
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,200
 I've been there.

321
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,140
 If the person whose thought bubble, if I could see it,

322
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,600
 says, "You can't make me," trust me, I already know.

323
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,100
 I know I can.

324
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,300
 But I wanna invite you,

325
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,440
 because some of you in this room are available tonight.

326
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,680
 That's the way it works.

327
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,440
 There's always people who are available

328
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,920
 to be united in mission.

329
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,520
 It doesn't matter if you're united in truth, in worship,

330
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,380
 if you don't, at the end of the day, excuse me,

331
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,220
 if you don't ultimately put it into practice

332
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,520
 to connect people with God and with one another.

333
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,320
 So I'm gonna talk about mission tonight.

334
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,520
 And I wanna introduce you to the one

335
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,760
 who will set you on the mission of a lifetime.

336
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,400
 And that is, of course, the person of Jesus.

337
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,360
 And I want you to see what it looks like

338
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,960
 when he orients his life around mission,

339
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,360
 which is a model for us and what it looks like for us.

340
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,140
 All right, so I'm gonna take us to a story tonight.

341
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,980
 It's really just a moment.

342
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,180
 It's a real moment in real time, in real history,

343
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,980
 2,000 years ago, where the person of Jesus

344
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,540
 interacts with some people.

345
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,780
 And there are some words that have shaped my very life.

346
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,840
 And I hope they will yours.

347
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,340
 Here they come.

348
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
 It starts like this.

349
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,380
 "And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages,

350
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,420
 teaching in their synagogues and doing two things."

351
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,460
 This is very important tonight.

352
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,000
 If you have any interest whatsoever in living on mission,

353
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,200
 this is gonna really matter for you.

354
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
 "He was proclaiming the gospel

355
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,460
 and he was healing every disease and affliction."

356
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,840
 So he's doing two things.

357
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
 They're paired together.

358
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,280
 You gotta have 'em both or you're not doing the mission.

359
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,100
 Here they are.

360
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,140
 "Proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom Jesus was doing,

361
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,620
 and he was healing every disease and affliction."

362
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,840
 You could summarize this by saying

363
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,960
 he was speaking and he was serving.

364
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,620
 He's speaking a body of content.

365
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,220
 He's got stuff to say.

366
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,160
 The gospel, I'm gonna explain that in just a moment.

367
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,720
 But that's the content of what he has to say.

368
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,560
 He is proclaiming the gospel,

369
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,400
 and he's also helping people

370
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,540
 with their felt needs in real time.

371
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,640
 He's creating relief for people who are hurting.

372
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,200
 And so he is doing both of these, not one or the other.

373
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,700
 And so you can always count on this.

374
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,980
 Mission for God means speaking and serving

375
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,320
 all the time, always, and forever,

376
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,180
 right from the example of Christ.

377
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,240
 Mission for God, if you have any interest whatsoever

378
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,980
 in giving your life to God,

379
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,480
 mission for God means speaking and serving.

380
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,860
 He said it said he was proclaiming the gospel.

381
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,820
 What does that mean?

382
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,420
 What is the gospel?

383
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,920
 What's this thing he was saying?

384
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,520
 I understand the word gospel is interesting

385
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,560
 because it can sound a little bit

386
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,900
 like a religious catch-all word

387
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,800
 that it means everything and somehow means nothing,

388
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,360
 and you have no clear idea.

389
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,460
 You know, like, what does gospel mean?

390
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,200
 Isn't it a type of music after all?

391
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,500
 What does it actually mean when we're saying

392
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,040
 he's proclaiming the gospel?

393
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,700
 Here's what it means.

394
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,540
 It means that we're all mid-mission

395
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,940
 to live for ourselves and not God.

396
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,080
 It means that we've all, to the last human

397
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,180
 who's ever lived, pushed God away and said,

398
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,880
 "I have my own mission, thank you very much.

399
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,380
 "I'll live in this world that you created on my terms

400
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,260
 "for myself and for my own ends and not for yours,

401
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,200
 "thank you, but I'll call you if I need you, bye."

402
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,960
 That's what sin is.

403
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,860
 That's us separating ourself from God,

404
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,260
 not because he wanted us to separate,

405
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,840
 but because we wanted something else.

406
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,880
 And yet God didn't wait for us to turn back to him

407
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
 and say, "God, you know, maybe we really messed up,"

408
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,540
 'cause we would never have done it.

409
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,820
 Instead, he sent his son Christ, his son, Jesus Christ,

410
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,320
 to pursue us as an expression of his love

411
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,760
 and care and forgiveness.

412
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,020
 Do you see that?

413
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,660
 So we broke up with God and he pursues us anyway,

414
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,760
 and at the cross and resurrection of Christ,

415
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,560
 wins us back to himself.

416
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,800
 That's a beautiful story.

417
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,940
 And it's not just a story,

418
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,200
 it happens to be the fact of history,

419
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,500
 and that's the gospel, that's the good news.

420
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,140
 This is what Jesus is going around telling people,

421
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,340
 that even though people, all of us,

422
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,080
 I can say down to a person, I know myself,

423
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,540
 and I know this is common with you,

424
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,140
 that each one of us has pursued our own selves

425
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,320
 as our own mission,

426
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,740
 but God has decided to set his love on us

427
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,980
 instead of his judgment,

428
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,320
 and he's come for us in the person of Christ

429
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,380
 to bring us back to himself.

430
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,820
 That is the gospel.

431
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,220
 That's what it is.

432
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,760
 And if you are gonna serve God,

433
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,560
 if you wanna live on mission to any degree,

434
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,800
 it is going to involve that coming out of your mouth.

435
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,260
 It's going to involve that being shared.

436
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,000
 It's going to involve that being spoken,

437
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,140
 and it must be spoken.

438
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,840
 It's got to be transferred in words.

439
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,720
 You must speak.

440
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
 That's part of it.

441
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,480
 But you also must serve.

442
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
 This is also what Jesus is doing.

443
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,860
 He says he was healing every disease.

444
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,220
 Now, I know some of you are like, you know what?

445
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,620
 Does that mean everybody should be a nurse or a doctor?

446
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,960
 How do I heal every disease?

447
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,000
 No, that's helping anyway.

448
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,820
 That's not fully healing.

449
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,200
 None of us have the full power of God

450
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,800
 in our touch the way that Jesus did and does.

451
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,440
 But what we do have is we have the ability in his name

452
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
 and after his example,

453
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,240
 to serve people with their real needs in real time.

454
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,880
 The church for 2,000 years has been known

455
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,340
 for taking care of people.

456
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,820
 Did you know in the early Roman Empire,

457
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,240
 this is so fascinating to me.

458
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,620
 I don't know, I love history.

459
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,980
 Once I didn't have to go to history class.

460
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,120
 It's never fun when somebody's making you learn it.

461
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,320
 But after the fact,

462
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,360
 it turns out there's some pretty interesting things.

463
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,600
 So in our history, if you name yourself a Christian,

464
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,320
 this is part of your heritage, by the way.

465
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,600
 Did you know that in the Roman Empire,

466
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
 in the early days of Christianity,

467
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,500
 that someone was once sent to spy on a group of Christians?

468
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,300
 Like the emperor sent someone to spy

469
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,780
 on an early Christian church service

470
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,040
 and kind of like blend in and be like,

471
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,880
 okay, what's going on?

472
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,040
 I don't know, but I'll pretend

473
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,740
 so I can take notes and report back.

474
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,920
 All right, so that took place.

475
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,740
 That's a real thing.

476
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,680
 And in the report, this person wrote,

477
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,780
 they sing a hymn.

478
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,760
 They gather early in the morning on Sunday

479
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,160
 to sing a hymn to Christ as to a God.

480
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,800
 I'm thinking, okay, I hadn't heard a lot yet.

481
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,620
 We do that.

482
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,920
 All right, that's what we do.

483
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,000
 And they not only take care of their own poor,

484
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
 but ours as well.

485
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,300
 In other words, when someone came to spy

486
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,880
 on early Christianity, early Christians,

487
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,440
 your forefathers in the faith,

488
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,520
 they found people who were taking care of people.

489
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
 They found people who had a humanitarian care

490
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,680
 at the heart of what they were doing.

491
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,780
 In other words, they weren't just speaking the gospel

492
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,220
 and saying, okay, we preach for today.

493
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,820
 Great time, we'll see you next week, everybody,

494
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,760
 'cause we love to preach.

495
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,180
 Yes, we do love to preach.

496
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,060
 No, it was sharing the content

497
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,900
 and it was also serving the needs of the people.

498
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,560
 It's always been this way and it must go together.

499
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,500
 If we wanna serve in the way Jesus served,

500
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,000
 if you wanna give your life to his mission to any degree,

501
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,700
 if you want to make your life count,

502
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,940
 it is going to involve both of those

503
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,240
 or it's missing half of his heart.

504
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,080
 I mean, think about this.

505
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,800
 What happens if you miss the,

506
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,380
 what happens if you miss the serving component?

507
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,340
 And you're like, okay, I won't serve people,

508
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,980
 I'll just talk.

509
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,640
 It will turn you into, as a Christian,

510
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,220
 just the person who kind of finger points

511
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,920
 and has a lot to say, but not a lot of love to give, right?

512
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,780
 That's a problem.

513
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,120
 So we must serve or otherwise people are gonna say,

514
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,260
 well, that's great to hear about,

515
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,860
 sin and forgiveness and everything,

516
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,420
 but I guess that doesn't do anything for me today

517
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,800
 because you certainly don't seem interested

518
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
 in doing anything for me today.

519
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,360
 So we must serve, we must put love into action, you see.

520
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,760
 So if we're gonna share the faith,

521
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,100
 we must also pair with it, we must pair with it service.

522
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,300
 But think about this.

523
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,740
 We also, some people make a different kind of error

524
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,220
 and they just want to serve, right?

525
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,340
 And just turn the church into just pure humanitarian relief,

526
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,680
 but not share that controversial gospel,

527
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,880
 that controversial gospel about sin and salvation

528
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,760
 and not open that controversial Bible, right?

529
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,960
 We're just gonna leave that part out.

530
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,220
 And what, you know, this mistake is,

531
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,520
 we'll just leave that part out

532
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,920
 and we'll come over here and we'll just do actions.

533
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,160
 You know, we'll just do actions.

534
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,500
 And that's such a mistake.

535
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,360
 You know, there's a quote from church history

536
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,700
 that is very popular and very wrong.

537
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,640
 If anybody's got this tattooed on you, I'm so sorry.

538
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,100
 But we gotta go here.

539
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,240
 The quote is this, "Preach the gospel.

540
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,840
 "If necessary, use words."

541
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,620
 Some people are like, man, that's deep.

542
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,820
 It's deeply wrong.

543
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,060
 And here's why.

544
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,280
 The gospel always includes words.

545
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,220
 People don't just, it doesn't dawn on people

546
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,000
 when they see your niceness that Jesus has risen again.

547
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,460
 It doesn't just work that way.

548
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,500
 Some of you actually think, like,

549
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,200
 that's your mission strategy.

550
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,560
 Some of you like, you show up and you're like,

551
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,540
 you know what, I'm gonna put my,

552
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,640
 I'm gonna do my work on time.

553
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,240
 And I'm gonna hold that, you know, door for people.

554
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,180
 And then, you know, no one's gonna walk

555
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,240
 through a door you hold and then be like,

556
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,080
 this must mean that God has saved humanity

557
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,980
 in the person of Christ.

558
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,660
 No one is gonna connect those dots.

559
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,760
 You have to make it plain.

560
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,320
 That's why Paul said in the scripture,

561
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,260
 I make it plain, which is how I ought to speak.

562
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,600
 So you've gotta make it plain.

563
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,360
 Words must always be involved every single time.

564
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,200
 So speaking and serving and speaking and serving.

565
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,000
 If you wanna get a tattoo, get one that says,

566
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,840
 "Preach the gospel.

567
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
 "If necessary, use a translator."

568
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,340
 All right, so you put that on your body

569
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,040
 if you need to put something on there, all right?

570
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,220
 It always involves words.

571
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,380
 Words and actions, words and actions, words and actions.

572
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,720
 Speak and serve if you wanna be like Christ.

573
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,420
 Let's go back to his example.

574
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,180
 Jesus said, "Now when he saw the crowds,"

575
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,560
 now think about what a crowd would be.

576
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,220
 This is the first century in the Middle East.

577
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,020
 Medicine is not near on the same place

578
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,100
 at this point in time, 2,000 years ago.

579
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,900
 Modern medicine is not even a distant glimmer in the future.

580
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,660
 People have got major, major, major, major, major needs.

581
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,400
 And when you see this crowd,

582
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,340
 the ones that were following Jesus around,

583
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,780
 they weren't just looking for the words of God

584
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,700
 to hear from his mouth.

585
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,740
 They were looking for a miracle in their body, right?

586
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,220
 From a disease that they could,

587
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,480
 today would be an afterthought, you know,

588
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,620
 but then was a death sentence.

589
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,720
 And so this crowd is harassed and helpless.

590
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,360
 And in fact, Jesus, as he saw that,

591
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,220
 he looked at the crowds and there was something in him

592
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,460
 that was sensitive to it.

593
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,460
 There was something in him that could see it.

594
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,440
 He could see the hurting hearts and minds and bodies

595
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,900
 and histories and futures.

596
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,580
 And he could see the weight of what it means

597
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,240
 to live on earth where life is hard and short.

598
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,180
 And to see all of that and perceive

599
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,440
 that these people have needs.

600
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,080
 And it says, when he saw these crowds,

601
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,520
 he had compassion for them

602
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,960
 because they were harassed and helpless

603
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,480
 like sheep without a shepherd.

604
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,920
 That's not arrogance, people.

605
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,160
 Some people are like, you know,

606
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,860
 when we preach these things in church,

607
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,520
 they go, "Do you think I'm harassed and helpless?"

608
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,020
 I'm like, "If you were, would you wanna know?"

609
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,800
 You know, because Jesus has the ability to look at us

610
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,840
 and see our inner state, right?

611
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,140
 He has the ability to see who we really are

612
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,080
 with compassion.

613
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,680
 So mission for God always means seeing needs.

614
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,440
 If you wanna serve God, you're gonna have to see needs.

615
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,040
 You're gonna have to want to see humanity

616
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,740
 for where it really is, your people around you,

617
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,320
 your family, your friends, your coworkers.

618
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,520
 You're gonna have to ask God, if you wanna serve God,

619
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,980
 if you're available for that tonight,

620
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,180
 you're gonna have to learn to ask God,

621
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,260
 can I see these people the way you see these people?

622
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,520
 Can I see the people around me?

623
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,760
 Yes, the ones even who frustrate me the most, them.

624
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,320
 I don't know who your them is, but oh my,

625
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,960
 everybody's got a them these days, okay?

626
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,400
 I don't know who your they are,

627
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,640
 that they're different than you and you don't like them,

628
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
 'cause they are the source

629
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,240
 of all of the problems in the world.

630
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,480
 I don't know who your them is,

631
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,280
 but you're gonna have to ask God to see them

632
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,180
 with his eyes and to see what spiritual needs

633
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,580
 are actually going on.

634
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,640
 Listen, we all have an unpaid 24/7 job

635
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,280
 of having it together.

636
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,460
 And I just wanna tell you, I don't buy it.

637
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,320
 Not even close.

638
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,520
 A while back, I was in a coffee shop in New York City,

639
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,760
 and you know you have to take a painfully boring step

640
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,120
 to start a church,

641
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,800
 just like starting any other organization.

642
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,600
 You have to write the bylaws.

643
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,100
 Some of you didn't even make it to laws.

644
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,960
 I said, "By," and you were like, "I'm down."

645
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,900
 You know, it's super boring,

646
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,240
 but it's important because you have to do things legally.

647
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,700
 And it actually is an opportunity.

648
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,780
 I just thought, you know what,

649
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,800
 I'm gonna drink a cup of coffee,

650
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,040
 I'm gonna look on the bright side.

651
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,880
 This is where you get to pour out

652
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,540
 all your nice, neat ideas.

653
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,080
 It's your church on paper.

654
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,280
 It's the laws of how the church is governed.

655
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,880
 And so when you're starting a church from scratch,

656
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,720
 I'm like, "I didn't do this.

657
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,220
 "They did this at Watermark in like 1999.

658
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,860
 "I wasn't around, you know, so I didn't have to do,

659
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,060
 "I didn't have to be a part of this."

660
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,360
 But all of a sudden, I'm like, "You know what?

661
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,720
 "I'm gonna type out all of the things

662
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,400
 "that need to happen at the church."

663
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,200
 And all of a sudden, I'm like,

664
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,860
 "You gotta do all the legalese, you know,

665
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,340
 "pursuant to the laws of the state of New York

666
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,500
 "and these United States of America,

667
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,740
 "the church shall blah-di-blah-di-blah."

668
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,000
 Okay, and so I'm getting something

669
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,340
 that I'm like pretty proud of.

670
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,040
 I copy and pasted most of it, but that's all right.

671
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,980
 But anyway, I'm getting something

672
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,940
 that feels like pretty good, all right?

673
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,280
 And all of a sudden, I look up, I look up,

674
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,320
 I was sitting right at a window.

675
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,020
 I looked up and there's this glass right here,

676
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,480
 and people are walking down the sidewalk.

677
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,960
 And within half a second of me looking up,

678
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,380
 it was a man and a woman,

679
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,820
 and within half a second of me looking up,

680
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,020
 there's a weird turn to this story,

681
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,860
 just brace for impact.

682
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,820
 He just vomits on the street.

683
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,860
 I know, I'm sorry.

684
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,000
 Anyway, that's what I said.

685
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,820
 I was like, "Dag."

686
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,040
 All right, so anyway, he vomited right there

687
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,600
 and as I looked what was going on,

688
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,700
 my heart just broke because they were,

689
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,440
 the man and the woman were,

690
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,240
 their eyes were wide open, like glazed over

691
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,780
 on a total drug high.

692
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,240
 It was so obvious.

693
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,880
 You know, it was just so obvious.

694
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,620
 And he had a towel on his shoulder,

695
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,760
 like he knew, he knew they were gonna shuffle around

696
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,220
 the city and go from high to high.

697
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,960
 That's how they spend their time, you know?

698
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,660
 It was so clear, like that's what they do.

699
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,160
 And as they walked by, I looked back at my computer

700
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,960
 and I heard this little voice say,

701
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,560
 "Do you want a church of neat

702
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,500
 "or do you want a church of needs?

703
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,700
 "Do you want a church of neat

704
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,880
 "or do you want a church of needs, really?"

705
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,440
 Because at the end of the day,

706
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,120
 some of us make it about this far,

707
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,320
 but we don't really wanna do anything

708
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,440
 if it causes us to be around real roughness,

709
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,280
 you know what I mean?

710
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,620
 Somebody who's really does not have it together

711
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,320
 and it's not pretty and it's never gonna be.

712
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,360
 Some of us are like, "You know what?

713
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,280
 "All right, I'm tracking with you.

714
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,220
 "Yeah, speaking and serving, speaking and serving.

715
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,320
 "But what you're really thinking is,

716
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,800
 "as long as I get to do that for pretty reason,

717
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,500
 "I'm gonna do that for pretty people."

718
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,700
 That's not the way it works.

719
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,100
 Jesus didn't do that.

720
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,260
 He didn't pick, he wasn't like,

721
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,040
 "Okay, I'm gonna redeem humanity,

722
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,540
 "but I need a few things to kind of go my way.

723
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,580
 "So I'm gonna pick a time and a place

724
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,180
 "where maybe I could accrue some comforts

725
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,480
 "and be around the desirable of humanity."

726
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,040
 Well, he didn't do that.

727
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,320
 He went to a place, he was born in an animal area, right?

728
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,360
 That's the manger story of Christmas, right?

729
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,480
 He didn't pick what was glorious or glamorous

730
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,420
 in this world to surround himself with.

731
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,420
 And some of you guys I know are like cool with being apart.

732
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,400
 You'll ride his coattails as long as,

733
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,720
 you know, you kind of get to rub off

734
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,240
 on some Christian subculture wave

735
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,660
 that means you're cool somehow or something.

736
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
 It's weird, 'cause he just didn't do that.

737
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,180
 He just served people, took care of people.

738
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,040
 Church has gotta be a place for people with real needs.

739
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,400
 If you have real needs, by the way,

740
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,320
 and you've reached a place of humility tonight,

741
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,480
 oh my, you're the healthiest person in the room

742
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,120
 because you know you have needs

743
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,780
 and you know Jesus is there for you.

744
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,320
 And you know, by the way, you are the person

745
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,720
 that he will be able to put to work.

746
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,320
 He'll be the person that he will save by his work

747
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,700
 and then put you into his work.

748
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,360
 Now, listen, just by way of practical application,

749
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,300
 I'm not sure somebody's gonna go by your desk tomorrow

750
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,560
 and just like throw up

751
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,000
 and then you're gonna be able to share the gospel.

752
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,400
 I don't know that it's gonna go exactly that way,

753
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,800
 but you know what?

754
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,980
 They might've thrown up over Labor Day weekend

755
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,980
 and had time to clean up and shower,

756
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,880
 but they still feel guilt from whatever lifestyle

757
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,620
 they're cyclically stuck in, right?

758
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,280
 You gotta be awake to this.

759
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,480
 If you wanna serve God,

760
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,920
 you're gonna have to be able to see needs

761
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,360
 and understand what's going on in this world

762
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,980
 and what people are really up against.

763
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,160
 When people give you the, I got it together vibe,

764
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,020
 I don't know that we can buy that with any integrity

765
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,360
 from a Christian worldview.

766
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,300
 Let's go back to Jesus one more time.

767
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,160
 Then he said to his disciples,

768
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,240
 there's a problem here he's gonna explain.

769
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,440
 The harvest is plentiful.

770
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,240
 Now this is an agrarian society.

771
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,440
 They grew what they ate, they ate what they grew.

772
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,280
 I'm bad at it.

773
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,120
 I don't live in an agrarian society.

774
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,940
 I'm sorry.

775
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,080
 They ate what they grew, okay?

776
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,820
 They grew the food and they ate it, right?

777
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,720
 An agrarian subsistence society.

778
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,160
 So when he says the harvest is plentiful,

779
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,020
 any farmer would have been looking out

780
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,160
 and when the harvest is plentiful,

781
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,800
 you feel this sense of potential.

782
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,460
 It's like, oh, what could be gathered is so good.

783
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,500
 What could be gathered is so good.

784
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,160
 And Jesus is saying, spiritually speaking,

785
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,000
 humanity is like that.

786
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,040
 What could be gathered is so exciting.

787
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,440
 The potential here is great.

788
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,740
 But the laborers are few.

789
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,020
 Not a lot of people wanna do this.

790
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,940
 It's expensive.

791
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,780
 It's hard.

792
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,440
 It's sacrificial.

793
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,020
 People feel like they lose options.

794
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,920
 They can't live for themselves anymore.

795
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,960
 Therefore, here comes the punchline.

796
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,720
 Therefore, pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest,

797
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,900
 because this is God's harvest,

798
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
 not yours, not your pastor's, not mine.

799
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,360
 It's not any of ours, it's God's.

800
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,700
 Pray earnestly to the Lord of these people

801
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:26,040
 to send out laborers into his harvest.

802
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,640
 I want you to do this.

803
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,680
 I want you to pray, God, will you send people out?

804
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,520
 This is fascinating to me for two reasons.

805
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,420
 First off, Jesus is God,

806
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,620
 and if he wanted to heal all the crowds

807
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,360
 with like one wave of the magic wand,

808
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,620
 he could have done that.

809
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,260
 He could have been like, everybody's fine,

810
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,760
 and it's over, right?

811
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,700
 But he decides that his strategy

812
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,600
 is he's going to enlist normal people

813
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,900
 to serve and speak to normal people,

814
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,640
 that he's not gonna do this rescue to people directly.

815
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,900
 He's gonna do it to and through people,

816
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,480
 that he's gonna use normal people like you and I

817
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,900
 to reach normal people like you and I.

818
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,240
 That's what he's gonna do.

819
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,020
 And you gotta know the disciples are super unnerved by this.

820
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,040
 This is weird, all right?

821
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,320
 You're following Jesus around.

822
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,620
 You've seen him do a bunch of miracles,

823
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,080
 and then a crowd comes and you're like,

824
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,820
 he's gonna dominate, watch.

825
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,260
 And then Jesus sees the crowd,

826
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,320
 and it's almost like he goes, wow, that's a lot of need.

827
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
 Hey, you guys should really do something.

828
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,160
 You know?

829
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,360
 And what are they all doing?

830
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
 They're like, wow, look at all these needs.

831
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,600
 You should really do something.

832
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,200
 And he's like, no, no, you should really do something.

833
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,000
 And so Jesus has decided that he will invite regular people.

834
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,200
 I remember feeling so weird in church,

835
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,680
 like, listen, if I ever decided to clean up my act,

836
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,520
 which I'm not sure I ever will,

837
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,420
 I'm definitely not Jesus's blue chip recruit.

838
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,880
 Let me tell you that.

839
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,220
 I am just not, and I'm not a first-round draft pick.

840
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,060
 You know what I'm saying?

841
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,380
 And it turns out, if you have any needs whatsoever,

842
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,300
 and Jesus captures your heart, yes, you are.

843
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,120
 You can serve him.

844
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,740
 He's reaching people through people.

845
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,100
 That is his strategy.

846
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,940
 You are invited.

847
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,680
 All you need is need and availability to be used by him.

848
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,540
 So don't miss the fact that he doesn't look at everybody

849
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,440
 and go, you know what?

850
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,280
 Well, I'm glad I'm here.

851
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,580
 Nevermind about the crowd in that place or that country

852
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,080
 or 100 years later or 100 years from now.

853
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,220
 I'm glad I'm here now.

854
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,660
 Everybody's fine.

855
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,360
 That's not the way he set it up.

856
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,000
 He set it up so that human beings who are in touch with him

857
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,820
 would contribute to human flourishing,

858
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,240
 through the gospel and through the meeting

859
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,140
 of real human needs.

860
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,120
 That's what it means to be on mission.

861
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,680
 That's the first reason I find this exciting.

862
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,860
 The second is the word for send out.

863
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,920
 This is one of my favorite words in the entire Bible.

864
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,760
 I don't wanna shock anybody,

865
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,520
 but the Bible was not written in English.

866
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,700
 This book, the New Testament, was actually written in Greek.

867
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,540
 It's all Greek to you.

868
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,380
 I know, I've heard all the jokes.

869
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,220
 It's all Greek to you.

870
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,080
 But anyway, the New Testament was written in Greek.

871
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,000
 And this word for send out is important.

872
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,760
 I wouldn't tell you about it unless it was important.

873
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,920
 This word for send out is the word ekballo.

874
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,760
 Ekballo.

875
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,560
 You can try it out if you just feel the need to.

876
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,600
 Ekballo.

877
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,560
 All right, you missed your chance

878
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,400
 if you didn't get it right there.

879
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,520
 All right, we're gonna move on.

880
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,880
 Ekballo is not really just to send out,

881
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,840
 like hopefully, like maybe, like when you get around to it.

882
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,320
 It is to expel or to force out or to drive out.

883
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,900
 Ekballo is the word used a few pages later

884
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,940
 when Jesus cast out a demon, okay?

885
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,400
 So Jesus ekballos the demon.

886
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,180
 It's not like, you know, maybe or possibly,

887
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,900
 or if you could fit it into your calendar.

888
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,460
 It's like right now, okay?

889
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,100
 So sending ekballo is not like,

890
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,760
 I'm gonna send something through the mail

891
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,740
 during the pandemic and maybe it will get there.

892
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,980
 It's not like that.

893
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,500
 This is, it is for sure gonna happen.

894
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,100
 This is like when a spouse offends another spouse

895
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,740
 and you get ekballo'd to the couch.

896
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,520
 Like you're going, you know?

897
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,540
 It's like on a ball game.

898
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,660
 If you're watching a baseball game,

899
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,900
 I'm a baseball fan, got a baseball background.

900
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,740
 It's like when someone gets thrown out of the game

901
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,900
 and the umpire is like, you, ekballo.

902
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,940
 And like, you can resist, but you are going.

903
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,280
 Like for sure, for sure.

904
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,380
 So ekballo is this concept that it is going to happen.

905
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,860
 It's forceful, right?

906
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,580
 He's literally saying, so Jesus sees the crowd.

907
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,980
 He sees all these needs and he says,

908
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,980
 guys, I want you to pray that God will banish people

909
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,860
 into his mission, that he will get them out of their seats

910
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,220
 or their slumber or their spiritual boredom

911
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,620
 and that he will actually move them forward

912
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,820
 because it will take a miracle to move some people

913
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,760
 because some people don't want to do this.

914
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,260
 Some people want to be podcast junkies.

915
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,720
 Some people want to associate

916
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,300
 with never ending conferences and events.

917
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,260
 Some people don't want to actually move

918
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,660
 and do something to represent the name and fame of Christ.

919
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,400
 And this is why too many churches

920
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
 look like college football games.

921
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,560
 A few people doing a lot of work

922
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,540
 that desperately need rest.

923
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
 And a lot of people watching

924
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,000
 who desperately need exercise.

925
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,860
 (congregation applauding)

926
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,260
 Jesus knows our problems.

927
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,660
 He knows what we're gonna do wrong.

928
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,040
 He knows what we're gonna do wrong.

929
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,700
 So he says, listen, this is a matter of prayer

930
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,940
 because I know you people don't want to get out there

931
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,780
 and serve people.

932
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,540
 So I want you to pray to God that he will ekballo people

933
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,260
 and get them going to do something with their lives

934
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,160
 and stop wasting it week into weekend.

935
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,400
 (congregation applauding)

936
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,360
 So mission for God means living sent every single time.

937
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,760
 This is why it always has to be more than like,

938
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,240
 oh, you know, I don't know, I turned 27

939
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,920
 and sounds more mature than 26.

940
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,480
 So I guess I ought to clean it up.

941
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,880
 That's not living sent.

942
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,240
 You gotta be sent by God.

943
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,040
 This is why it's gotta be more than a new year's resolution.

944
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,860
 That's why it's gotta be more

945
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,240
 than some new self-improvement discipline project.

946
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,320
 Listen, if you want to live for God

947
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,880
 with any longevity whatsoever,

948
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,220
 you have got to be sent by him.

949
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,440
 Listen, if some of you, if you think your mission,

950
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,280
 if you think what God wants from you

951
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,120
 is to come to church 2.5 times a month and curse less,

952
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,360
 you have not been sent on a mighty mission.

953
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,080
 Although I can't advocate for you doing the mission

954
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,900
 while cursing a lot.

955
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,080
 That would be confusing, all right?

956
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,480
 But the point of life is not to tidy up

957
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,480
 in some minutiae related way, right?

958
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,600
 But to give glory to God with everything that you do

959
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,060
 and to be sent in a mission that will echo into eternity.

960
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,880
 And some of us I know think,

961
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,720
 "Oh, that's for somebody else."

962
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,200
 And I assure you, it is for you.

963
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,320
 You are invited.

964
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,240
 If you're available tonight

965
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,720
 and you're not already mid-mission to live for yourself

966
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,320
 and you're available,

967
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,120
 Jesus will send you on the ride of your life.

968
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,880
 I don't know how I became a Christian, a pastor.

969
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,120
 I certainly don't know how I moved everything I own

970
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
 in a U-Haul to New York City

971
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,640
 to try to start of all things a church.

972
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,160
 I can tell you with the utmost certainty,

973
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,240
 I don't know how I got here

974
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,160
 other than simply saying, "God, I am available.

975
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,600
 "I just wanna be available to do your bidding.

976
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,440
 "That's all I want.

977
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,640
 "I just wanna do your bidding."

978
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,140
 (congregation applauding)

979
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,520
 I don't know what adventure,

980
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,280
 I don't know where Jesus would send you.

981
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,240
 There's a lot of countries in the world.

982
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,600
 There's a lot of cities in the world.

983
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,560
 There's also a lot of coworkers at your current space.

984
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,060
 May not send you anywhere except to work tomorrow.

985
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,080
 I don't know where he's gonna send you.

986
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,920
 I just don't want you to miss it.

987
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,200
 I don't want you to miss it from the boredom

988
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,720
 of your repetition plan

989
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,320
 that you know is already not giving you life.

990
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,960
 I'll close with this idea.

991
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
 You've gotta be resilient.

992
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,320
 If you wanna live on mission for Christ, for God,

993
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,240
 you wanna live for something more,

994
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,080
 you don't wanna waste your life.

995
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,560
 Maybe I made a dent somehow by the Spirit of God tonight

996
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,760
 and you don't want to live for yourself any longer.

997
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,400
 Listen, I wanna warn you up front,

998
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
 you need some resilience.

999
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,320
 You need to be able to stick with it

1000
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,480
 because you will be resisted.

1001
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,400
 I just wanna be honest.

1002
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,080
 I don't wanna come in here and throw a pep rally

1003
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,900
 and everybody's fired up

1004
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,240
 and then I'm not gonna act like the scripture

1005
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,160
 also doesn't talk about our suffering in this mission.

1006
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
 This is a challenge, people.

1007
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,000
 This is really tough.

1008
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,400
 I was on my way to church.

1009
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,640
 We were doing a little preview service about a year ago

1010
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,120
 because we officially launched here in a week and a half.

1011
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,180
 But about a year ago, I was on my way

1012
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,960
 to do a little preview service in downtown Brooklyn

1013
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,060
 and they had these rental mopeds

1014
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,240
 that are really great to get around.

1015
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,160
 So I decided to rent one of those

1016
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,960
 and I started to go to church

1017
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,200
 and about halfway there, I just stopped at a red light

1018
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,520
 and I looked up and all of a sudden,

1019
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,480
 a guy's standing in front of the bike,

1020
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,000
 really weirdly close and really randomly angry

1021
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,880
 and I'm like, "Oh no, I don't know what this is."

1022
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,960
 And so I start to just drive around him.

1023
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,200
 He shoves me off the bike.

1024
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,920
 It clatters to the ground behind me.

1025
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,000
 And I turn around.

1026
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,120
 Listen, I'm just gonna tell you people,

1027
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,720
 I'm a preacher, I'm a talker, I'm not a fighter.

1028
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,080
 All right, so I turn around.

1029
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,640
 I'm like, "Hey, we're gonna talk about this."

1030
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,280
 So I turned around.

1031
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,880
 I had my AirPods playing underneath the helmet.

1032
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,700
 I don't know if that's safe.

1033
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,720
 But anyway, I had music going.

1034
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,340
 So anyway, I'm trying to get into the vibe.

1035
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,180
 I'm going to church.

1036
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,140
 You know what I mean?

1037
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,100
 So I like stopped my AirPods

1038
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,020
 and by the time I turned around,

1039
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,660
 hit a right hook, like hit me right in the chin.

1040
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,500
 And just, and here's the thing,

1041
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,180
 at the end of the day, that was the only hit.

1042
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,620
 So it wasn't that bad.

1043
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,100
 But in that moment, you don't know where it's gonna stop.

1044
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,940
 You really don't.

1045
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,220
 It's just a strange, a really strange moment.

1046
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,220
 And all of a sudden, I think he decided the moped

1047
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,500
 was more important than the fight.

1048
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,900
 He got on the moped, he drove off

1049
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,180
 and the police came after him

1050
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,900
 and I just walked to church and preached the sermon.

1051
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,780
 You know why?

1052
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,540
 Because my mouth still worked

1053
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,420
 and because it's not the end of the world.

1054
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,740
 And listen, I just want to tell you,

1055
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,340
 that's the, that's, oh, please don't clap

1056
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,540
 because it's so small compared to what people go through.

1057
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,900
 I'm sorry, I know some of you are trying to encourage me.

1058
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,720
 Thank you.

1059
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,060
 But listen, that's so small.

1060
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,700
 I know, I know a pastor in New York City

1061
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
 who almost had his life taken in a scenario like that.

1062
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,200
 It's, what, that is so small.

1063
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,180
 That's a painfully mundane illustration.

1064
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,580
 But I just want to tell you, people go through real things.

1065
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,940
 You ask Christians in other parts of the world.

1066
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,180
 Christian suffering is not another,

1067
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,820
 it's not just another century.

1068
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,420
 It's another place at times, right now.

1069
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,820
 This is not a game, all right?

1070
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,380
 And listen, some of you have a,

1071
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,700
 are gonna leave this building with a plan to do good

1072
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,580
 and a plan to do well and the world's gonna resist you.

1073
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,500
 Listen, in the words of the great theologian, Mike Tyson,

1074
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,380
 everybody has a plan until they get hit in the mouth.

1075
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,700
 All right, so listen, some of you are gonna,

1076
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,860
 some of you are gonna leave here with a plan.

1077
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,700
 You're like, I am going to give my life to God.

1078
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,900
 No, I'm for real, for real this time.

1079
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,740
 And I just want to tell you,

1080
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,140
 the whole world might not clap for you,

1081
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,420
 but God will and the church will

1082
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,100
 and you stay encouraged, all right?

1083
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,780
 Nobody ever said this was gonna be easy.

1084
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,700
 This is not a game, all right?

1085
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,540
 But it is a chance to lift up the fame

1086
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,220
 of the only person whose name will outlast all of our names.

1087
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,480
 That's the name of Jesus.

1088
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,960
 Let's pray.

1089
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:14,660
 Jesus, thank you for showing us how to love people,

1090
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,540
 how to care.

1091
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,360
 Thank you for snapping us out of our dead routine.

1092
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,980
 Thank you for inviting us to something

1093
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,300
 that is so much better than the life

1094
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,820
 we could create for ourselves.

1095
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:30,020
 Thank you that in you is life and life abundant.

1096
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,540
 Thank you that in you is forgiveness

1097
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,460
 for a thousand wasted evenings.

1098
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,480
 Thank you that in you is peace

1099
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,380
 for a thousand fearful thoughts.

1100
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,460
 And thank you that in you is the only future

1101
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,080
 that is going to satisfy to any degree.

1102
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,640
 And thank you, Jesus, that your mission was to rescue us

1103
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,380
 so that you don't need us to get out of here

1104
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,060
 and do stuff for you to love us.

1105
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,260
 But you already love us,

1106
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,700
 and our mission comes from an overflow

1107
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,660
 of our connection to you.

1108
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,760
 Our mission comes from an overflow

1109
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,740
 of a connection with you.

1110
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,320
 We don't have to try to live on mission

1111
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,260
 so that you'll love us.

1112
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,360
 We live on mission because you already do.

1113
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,500
 Father, I pray for freedom.

1114
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,860
 I feel the potential of the people around me.

1115
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:16,100
 And Father, I know, I know that you are able,

1116
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,020
 only you, I know I can convince no one,

1117
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,000
 but you are able to move people

1118
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,660
 from living for themselves to living for you.

1119
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,260
 And I pray that you would do that miracle in mass

1120
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,460
 for these people in Jesus' name, amen.

1121
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:37,460
