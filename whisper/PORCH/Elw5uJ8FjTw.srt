4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:36,360
 Come on, Forbes.

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,880
 Let me hear from you.

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,600
 How are we doing?

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,920
 We doing OK?

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,240
 Hey, it's great to see you.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,760
 Welcome back.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,960
 So glad to have you in the room.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,280
 Special shout out to everybody that's tuning in online.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,600
 We love that you would be in the space with us.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,440
 Portslive Midlands, Springfield, Greater Lafayette,

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,400
 we love you guys.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,680
 Thanks for being a part of Tuesday nights.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,320
 Man, I'm eager for tonight.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,520
 I think God has something really good for us.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,240
 I'm ready to jump into it.

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,520
 If you're here for the very first time, welcome.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,060
 It's also fun to look across the room

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,520
 and see a bunch of familiar faces.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,640
 So thanks for continuing to show up and be with us

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,840
 and be a part of what God is doing here.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,440
 Well, early in my young adult years,

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,360
 I encountered what was one of the most frightening moments

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,960
 in my life to that time and quite possibly one

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,320
 of the most frightening moments that I've had since that time.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,800
 You see, it was around Christmas.

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,060
 And I still lived in College Station, Texas.

30
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,800
 And what was characteristically true of a college town

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,120
 was during Christmas, most people would,

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,200
 they would evacuate, like they would leave,

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,280
 they would get out of town.

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
 And I wasn't married at the time,

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,320
 so I still had college roommates

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,680
 and all of them had done exactly that.

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,080
 They had all left the city.

38
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,400
 They had all gone home to be with their friends and family.

39
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,360
 I had one buddy that played for the football team.

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,840
 And so he was away on a bowl game.

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,040
 And so I'm at the house holding it down all by myself.

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
 And so I'm doing what normal people do,

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,700
 late into the evening.

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,660
 I'm just like, I'm doing laundry, I'm fixing food.

45
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,920
 I'm just trying to pass the time until I can go to sleep.

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,960
 And so one thing that I customarily did

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,240
 is I would start a load of laundry

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,080
 and then I would wake up and I would transition it.

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,960
 And so I was doing that.

50
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,140
 I was in the laundry room, I'm putting a load in.

51
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,800
 And as I'm doing that, just to my left, outside the window,

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,800
 I see some headlights kind of span across the window

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,960
 and then stop.

54
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,520
 So I walk over and I just like peek through the blinds

55
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,040
 and I look to see what I can find.

56
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,160
 And what I see there is a truck, a really nice truck,

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,740
 but a truck I'd never seen before, pulled up to my house.

58
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,500
 It wasn't pulled up like you would normally see someone

59
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,920
 if they were parking to come inside.

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,000
 Like it had pulled up and it was sitting at a diagonal.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,560
 Like it was at a 45 degree angle, was not parked to stay.

62
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,840
 And yet as I was inspecting and trying to put together,

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
 man, what's actually happening here?

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,640
 I saw two guys hop out of the truck.

65
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,280
 And so they pile out and they walk to the back of the pickup

66
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,920
 and they grab out of the back a couple of big duffel bags.

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,880
 I'm like, man, this all surely has a plausible explanation

68
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,760
 until they cross through my yard

69
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,240
 and they make their way to my front door.

70
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,960
 Now I'm not one to normally panic,

71
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,920
 but in this moment, my heart began to race a little bit.

72
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,940
 And so I'm trying to make sense of who these guys are.

73
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,960
 Because like I said, I have four roommates,

74
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,840
 three of which are gone.

75
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
 One is already out of town.

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,680
 He's at a bowl game.

77
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,560
 And so no one should be dropping by our house,

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,320
 especially this late in the evening.

79
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,180
 And so I'm trying to do the mental math,

80
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,560
 put it all together when I begin to not only see

81
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,400
 them approach the front door,

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,300
 but I actually begin to hear murmuring inside of my house.

83
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,260
 And so I stopped doing my laundry.

84
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:47,460
 And I start processing what it is they're saying,

85
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,240
 though I can't hear them because again, I'm in the garage,

86
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,000
 they're in the front entryway.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,760
 And yet I can track their voices

88
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
 as they move through my house.

89
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,120
 They go from the entry into the living area.

90
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,920
 They turn the corner and they come into our dining room.

91
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,260
 And I lost a foot in the kitchen,

92
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,140
 which is just a door away from where I stood.

93
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,900
 What do you think I did in that moment?

94
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,740
 Open the door and said, "Hey guys, what's up?"

95
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,660
 No, absolutely not.

96
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,020
 I decided to bail.

97
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,920
 I ran.

98
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,300
 I slid the garage door open and I ran for my car.

99
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,300
 I turned it on immediately.

100
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,140
 I hit the ignition and I got out of there

101
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,420
 because this was not a situation

102
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,220
 that I wanted to be a part of.

103
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,260
 Now, as I'm driving away, I do the only sensible thing.

104
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,100
 I think to myself, I've got to call the cops.

105
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,280
 Like I've got to get some help.

106
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,460
 I've got to report the fact that there are unknown strangers

107
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,300
 inside my house.

108
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,980
 So I call up a college station police department

109
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,260
 and the rest of the experience felt like something

110
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,900
 straight out of cops.

111
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,140
 Like I'm still on the phone with police dispatch,

112
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,280
 but I can also hear their correspondence

113
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,040
 with the responders that are showing up to my place.

114
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,060
 We can confirm we've arrived.

115
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,220
 Truck is pulled at a 45 degree angle, still running.

116
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,380
 House lights are all off,

117
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,860
 except the garage does have a light on.

118
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,480
 No kidding, I was in there.

119
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,740
 Making our way to the front door.

120
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,580
 Okay, we're gonna knock and announce.

121
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,660
 (knocking)

122
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,740
 Police, open up.

123
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,780
 No response.

124
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,260
 (knocking)

125
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,740
 Police, open up.

126
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,540
 No response.

127
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,940
 One more time.

128
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,060
 (knocking)

129
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,500
 Police, open up, we're coming in.

130
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,220
 And then immediately the door swings open

131
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,660
 and there trained on three assault rifles

132
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,260
 is my college roommate, Blaine,

133
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,980
 who had very unexpectedly made a return trip that day

134
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,740
 from the bowl game

135
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,940
 because the team decided to come home early.

136
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,260
 You see, I had a very limited perspective

137
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,740
 about what was happening in my roommate's life.

138
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,220
 I thought I knew one thing,

139
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,620
 but in reality something different

140
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,580
 was happening altogether.

141
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,700
 I had a limited perspective

142
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,020
 and that limited perspective

143
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,200
 was almost massively consequential.

144
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,500
 Now, don't worry, Blaine was fine.

145
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,180
 It was just a misunderstanding.

146
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,300
 But while it's one thing to misunderstand

147
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,900
 the facts about your roommate's travel plans,

148
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,300
 it's another thing to misunderstand

149
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,480
 the facts around your plans for eternity.

150
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,720
 Like it's possible to be put in a situation

151
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,300
 where you're operating with a limited perspective

152
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,940
 on reality rather than a complete picture of reality.

153
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,780
 And if that's the case,

154
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,700
 what you need is you need the truth.

155
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,620
 Why do you need the truth?

156
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,620
 Because there are consequences to being wrong in life.

157
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,520
 Like there are repercussions to operating in error.

158
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,300
 Like there is a massive issue

159
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,540
 if you give the wrong kind

160
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,980
 or the wrong amount of medicine to someone,

161
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,100
 that's not helpful, that's harmful.

162
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,260
 If you book the right flight,

163
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,740
 but board the wrong flight,

164
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,820
 you're not going to arrive at the right destination.

165
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,720
 You're gonna arrive at someplace you never intended to be.

166
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,720
 If you choose to forget that girl's name

167
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
 that happens to be best friends

168
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,400
 with the one you're interested in,

169
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,560
 that's not the quickest road to making a good impression.

170
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,000
 It's the quickest way to ruining one.

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Not operating in the truth leads to massive issues.

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,440
 If in fact you are errored,

173
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,640
 you're gonna find that you have trouble.

174
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,200
 The truth matters because it not only gives us

175
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,040
 a correct picture of reality,

176
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,520
 it gives us a complete picture of reality.

177
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,800
 So helpful illustration just to get your mind around

178
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,380
 what I'm talking about is last week I was sitting up

179
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,720
 and watching a show and yet somewhere along the way,

180
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,260
 like the wifi was bad and the show stopped buffering well,

181
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,180
 the resolution decreased.

182
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,320
 And while I could make out some of what was happening,

183
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,720
 get the broad strokes, could still see the colors,

184
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,000
 knew there were two figures walking through the woods,

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,640
 I couldn't make out the details

186
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,680
 of what was actually happening.

187
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,560
 I couldn't see their facial expressions.

188
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,120
 I couldn't understand what was happening

189
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
 in the background around them.

190
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,120
 There were certain details to the entire dynamic

191
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,800
 that were absent me that I needed to know

192
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,720
 to ultimately put the whole story together.

193
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,760
 Truth brings your reality into high definition clarity.

194
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,400
 That's what it does.

195
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,360
 And yet so many of us, we move through life

196
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,600
 with low resolution because we're operating

197
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,540
 on the basis of our perspective.

198
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,320
 Or some other error.

199
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,200
 Tonight I wanna help you get greater clarity.

200
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,200
 I want to help you know what is truth.

201
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
 And to do it, we're gonna be in Matthew,

202
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,480
 sorry, John chapter 18.

203
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,080
 We were in Matthew last week.

204
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,040
 John chapter 18.

205
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,920
 While you're turning there,

206
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
 we've been in a series called Deconstructed

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,260
 where we've been trying to help you rebuild your reality.

208
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,000
 We just acknowledge that in our modern day,

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 there's a lot of good reason to question the faith,

210
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,280
 but there's not good reason to leave it.

211
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,980
 Like out of all the doubts you face

212
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,820
 and all the questions you have

213
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,080
 and all the concerns you feel,

214
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,220
 though they aren't inherently bad,

215
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,880
 in fact, they can be good

216
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,460
 should they motivate you to inspect further

217
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,160
 the things you believe.

218
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,560
 They can become bad if they ultimately lead you

219
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
 to deconstruct to a place where you remove what's weak,

220
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,040
 but you never put something strong in place instead.

221
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,900
 It's kind of like this.

222
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,620
 Like if you walked into your home

223
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,680
 and you realized you had a bad foundation,

224
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,760
 the right response in that moment

225
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,020
 is not to ignore the issue,

226
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,220
 nor is it to detonate the house.

227
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,120
 The right response is to call up a professional,

228
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,760
 it's to acknowledge the problem,

229
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,520
 it's to develop some solutions,

230
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
 and then it's to get to work.

231
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,840
 That's what we want you to do when it comes to your faith.

232
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,480
 Yes, it's actually good for you to identify,

233
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,600
 man, are there areas of doubt,

234
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,580
 questions I feel, concerns that I have

235
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,440
 that perhaps there are good answers for.

236
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,260
 If so, what are the answers as opposed to,

237
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,040
 you know what, this thing is all a hoax.

238
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,740
 I can't believe I ever thought this was true, I'm out.

239
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,480
 That's the wrong reply.

240
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,560
 And what we're talking about tonight

241
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,040
 is actually probably for many of us,

242
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,020
 the biggest, most awkward crack in our spiritual foundation,

243
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,880
 it's the idea of truth.

244
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,720
 And yet what you need to know

245
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,840
 is Jesus was obsessed with the idea of truth.

246
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,620
 He loved processing this with his people.

247
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,160
 And we're looking into a specific story

248
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,960
 where he is actually engaging this idea of truth

249
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,860
 more so than most.

250
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,340
 You see, over 80 different times,

251
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
 Jesus spoke the words, I tell you the truth,

252
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,580
 because he really cared about us

253
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,740
 having a very clear understanding of reality.

254
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,540
 And while the Bible may strike you as

255
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:07,820
 a stuck at some point in times past or antiquated even,

256
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,960
 what you need to know is that

257
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,260
 what they face in the Bible

258
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,820
 are very similar issues to what we face today.

259
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,060
 You shouldn't just write it off

260
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,340
 because it's culturally relevant to us right now.

261
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,660
 Like they face religious extremism and political corruption,

262
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,260
 institutional oppression,

263
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,820
 cross-cultural conflict and gender inequality.

264
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,760
 You think this has something

265
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,540
 that can actually speak into your world?

266
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,580
 I guarantee you it does.

267
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,340
 And so what we see in Matthew chapter 18,

268
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,340
 John chapter 18.

269
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,860
 John chapter 18.

270
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,740
 As we see this in verse 33,

271
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,940
 we're gonna read the entire section together

272
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,380
 and then we'll talk about it.

273
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:55,780
 So Pilate, who is the governor from Rome

274
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,900
 over the Judean province,

275
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,180
 entered his headquarters, the Praetorium again,

276
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,500
 and he called Jesus and said to him,

277
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,820
 are you the king of the Jews?

278
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,340
 And Jesus answered, do you say this of your own accord?

279
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,160
 Or did others say it to you about me?

280
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,640
 Pilate answered, am I a Jew?

281
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,720
 Your own nation and the chief priests

282
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,240
 have delivered you over to me.

283
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,940
 What have you done?

284
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,520
 And Jesus answered, my kingdom's not of this world.

285
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,880
 If my kingdom were of this world,

286
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,000
 my servants would have been fighting

287
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,520
 that I might not be delivered over to the Jews,

288
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,680
 but my kingdom is not from the world.

289
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,140
 Then Pilate said to him, so you are a king.

290
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,000
 And Jesus answered, you say that I'm a king.

291
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
 For this purpose I was born

292
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,220
 and for this purpose I have come into the world

293
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,240
 to bear witness to the truth.

294
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,960
 Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.

295
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,540
 And Pilate said to him, what is truth?

296
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,920
 This is fascinatingly the last intimate conversation

297
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,720
 Jesus likely ever had.

298
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,920
 Because to give you contextual background,

299
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,480
 he is on the final day of his life.

300
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,740
 He is experiencing trial, six in specific,

301
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,680
 three religious, three Roman,

302
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,480
 that will lead to his condemnation.

303
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,560
 And as he has this conversation with Pilate,

304
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,880
 he begins to help him understand what truth actually is,

305
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,600
 what truth actually isn't,

306
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,720
 and how he and we fit into it all.

307
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,640
 So Jesus says, in response to Pilate's question,

308
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
 hey, are you the king of the Jews?

309
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,520
 He looks at me and says, are you asking me this

310
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,440
 or are others asking me this?

311
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,080
 Because he's trying to get to the center of Pilate's motive.

312
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,600
 He wants to know, are you genuinely, seriously,

313
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,000
 sincerely spiritually seeking,

314
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 or are you just a puppet asking the questions of other men?

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,760
 You see, by this point, Jesus has been wrongly arrested,

316
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,920
 he's been falsely accused,

317
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,740
 and now he is ultimately condemned to death.

318
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,720
 And it's been done so by the religious leaders of his day,

319
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
 a group of guys known as the Sanhedrin,

320
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,560
 who were threatened by him.

321
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,840
 You see, they were threatened by Jesus

322
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,280
 because he had exposed their corruption,

323
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,400
 he had undermined all of their authority,

324
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,840
 and he had endangered their political power.

325
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,800
 And so what they want to do is they want to get rid of him.

326
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,400
 They don't want him around any longer,

327
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,640
 and so they brought Pilate into the scenario

328
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
 to ultimately bring about Roman execution

329
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,200
 because they cannot kill one of their own.

330
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,000
 And so what they decide is to use Pilate.

331
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,120
 Pilate asks the question, are you a king?

332
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,580
 And Jesus sniffs it out.

333
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,160
 He realizes, you're not asking me

334
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,280
 because you're really wondering,

335
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,520
 you're asking because they are actually trying

336
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,600
 to figure out if I will admit to being king or not.

337
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,200
 The truth of the matter is Jesus is king.

338
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,320
 He's king of the Jews.

339
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,160
 Like technically speaking, he is the Messiah,

340
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,440
 he's the anointed one, he's the long-awaited king of Israel.

341
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,920
 And yet in this moment, he doesn't fess up to it immediately

342
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,040
 because he wants to have this conversation,

343
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,360
 and he wants to accomplish,

344
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,600
 he wants to accomplish a message on truth.

345
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,320
 You see, Jesus, though he is the true king,

346
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,760
 he knows some people don't really want the truth.

347
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,100
 They just want to protect their way of life.

348
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,240
 But here's the thing, first point,

349
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,880
 the truth does not exist to serve our agenda.

350
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,040
 The truth does not exist to serve our agenda,

351
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,960
 at least that's what Jesus wants us to know,

352
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,400
 and yet in our postmodern age,

353
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,520
 that's often what we think the truth exists for.

354
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,080
 Like we want a truth that accommodates our comforts

355
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,320
 and it appeals to our preferences,

356
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,200
 and indulges our individuality,

357
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
 which leads us to treat the truth

358
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,640
 like shampoo at the grocery store.

359
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,600
 Hey man, what do you need?

360
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
 You got fizzy hair, you got oily hair,

361
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,560
 you got dry hair, you got damaged hair,

362
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,680
 whatever kind of shampoo you need,

363
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,640
 just pull it off the shelf,

364
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,920
 whatever truth you need to accommodate your way of life,

365
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,080
 just grab it for yourself, whatever you want.

366
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,660
 It's out there, it's available,

367
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,200
 and the way we see this play out in our culture

368
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,400
 is through different philosophies we should consider

369
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,240
 and worldviews that we should follow.

370
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,820
 You know them, you've heard of these.

371
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,140
 So many people advocate for relativism,

372
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,980
 that there's no such thing as one truth,

373
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,780
 that we can all have our own truth,

374
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:07,660
 unless your truth disagrees with my relative truth,

375
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,800
 then we're gonna have a problem.

376
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,860
 Or skepticism, another philosophy that's wildly popular,

377
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,580
 that truth actually isn't knowable.

378
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,420
 In fact, anything we think we can know,

379
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,380
 we probably should doubt instead.

380
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,720
 We should question, we should wonder if it's actually valid.

381
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,420
 It's not knowable, which is ironic,

382
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,060
 because the guy that came up with skepticism

383
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,500
 clearly thought there was a truth to know

384
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,480
 to develop that idea.

385
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,980
 Or postmodernism, like truth is just an illusion.

386
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,460
 It can't actually be affirmed.

387
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,300
 Well, tell that to the people

388
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,000
 that affirm postmodernism is true.

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,460
 Or pluralism, like all truths are equally valid.

390
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
 Like you can believe your truth,

391
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,300
 and you can believe your truth,

392
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,120
 and you can believe your truth,

393
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,640
 and I'll believe my truth, and they're all legit,

394
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,780
 they're all valid.

395
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,700
 That is, unless your truth contradicts my truth,

396
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,300
 and that doesn't make any sense.

397
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,900
 Or logical positivism,

398
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,780
 the idea that man, absolute truth does exist,

399
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,700
 but it must be scientifically verifiable,

400
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,980
 even though there are some scientific concepts

401
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,980
 that are not verifiable in and of themselves.

402
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,940
 You see, our world is convinced

403
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,340
 that rather than conform the truth,

404
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,660
 our lives to the truth,

405
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,760
 we will conform the truth to our lives.

406
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,140
 We will bend it, we will distort it,

407
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,300
 we will manipulate it to accommodate

408
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,820
 whatever sort of life we want

409
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,820
 as opposed to obstruct whatever sort of life

410
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,220
 God wants instead.

411
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,280
 That's what the religious leaders are doing in this story.

412
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,580
 Like rather than listen to Jesus, the voice of truth,

413
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,620
 they're indulging deceit,

414
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,680
 not only in their own lives, but the lives of others,

415
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,140
 listening to the voice of deception

416
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,780
 just to protect the kind of lifestyle they wanna have.

417
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,720
 And we do this ourselves.

418
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,580
 And we don't like what God has to say about our sexuality.

419
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,520
 And so we claim he's not loving because of it.

420
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,100
 We don't like the fact that Christians say

421
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,360
 masturbation is wrong,

422
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
 even though the Bible doesn't explicitly say

423
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,680
 that we shouldn't do it.

424
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,520
 And so you know what,

425
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,200
 I'm just gonna make an exception for that one instead.

426
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,840
 Or we don't like the fact that God says drunkenness is wrong

427
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,640
 but truthfully God, like what is drunk?

428
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,120
 I don't know, is it this, is it that?

429
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,000
 Is it getting buzzed?

430
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,280
 Is it having a few too many?

431
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,720
 Or is it just kicking some back with the boys?

432
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,840
 I'm not real sure, so you know what?

433
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,080
 I'll toe the line as opposed to stay away from it.

434
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,280
 And we don't like the fact that God feels

435
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,360
 like a narrow-minded bigot.

436
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,280
 Like how are you going to tell me what to do with my body?

437
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,640
 My body is mine.

438
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,460
 I can do with it what I want.

439
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,400
 Or maybe it's not that.

440
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,600
 Maybe instead it's the fact that the Bible,

441
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,440
 when you read through it,

442
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,320
 feels so patriarchal or so chauvinistic

443
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,300
 and you don't wanna follow a backwoods God

444
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,840
 that would subscribe these sorts of truths

445
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,200
 to the lives of his people.

446
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
 Listen to me, I'm not saying

447
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,440
 that you don't have legitimate questions

448
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,480
 about some of this stuff,

449
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,380
 but I am saying there are legitimate answers to all of it.

450
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,100
 You may not know them yet, but they are available.

451
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,400
 So recently I saw this story of a guy

452
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,320
 who has semi-made it his life mission

453
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,600
 to convince flat earthers that the world is round.

454
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,080
 And so he gathers up a crew of them

455
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,320
 and he takes them down to Antarctica

456
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,320
 because it's there that you can see the sun revolve

457
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,040
 in a circle, proving the fact that the earth is round.

458
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,800
 It doesn't rise in the east and set in the west.

459
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,840
 And so he takes a guy and he leads him to Antarctica.

460
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,760
 He is fully convinced the world is flat.

461
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,600
 And yet as he stands there and he watches the sun

462
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,560
 circulate over his head for 24 hours,

463
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,480
 he says these words.

464
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,160
 He says, "Well, sometimes you're wrong in life."

465
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,840
 I was pretty sure I wasn't, but it's a fact.

466
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,340
 The sun does circle you in the south,

467
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,400
 but that's not even the best part.

468
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,560
 Best part of this story is that the guy,

469
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,000
 though he was proven,

470
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,200
 though he was proven to have believed something wrong,

471
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,320
 he actually thanked the guy for being kind enough

472
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,240
 to lead him to the Southern continent

473
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,400
 to teach him the truth.

474
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
 It can feel arrogant for Christians to claim

475
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,440
 that they have the right view and everyone else is wrong.

476
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,720
 And admittedly, some Christians are extremely arrogant

477
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,600
 with the truth.

478
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,320
 But here's what I want you to know.

479
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,480
 If a follower of Jesus not only claims to know the truth,

480
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,720
 but actually shares it with someone, that's not arrogance.

481
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,600
 That's kindness.

482
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,040
 It's kindness to give the truth of God to other people.

483
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,360
 And that's what Jesus is advising we do here.

484
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,480
 The truth, it doesn't exist to serve your agenda.

485
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,480
 It exists to make sense of your reality.

486
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,520
 So then what is that reality?

487
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,000
 Well, Jesus is going to continue on.

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
 He says in 35 and 36, he says,

489
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,920
 "But Pilate answered, 'Am I a Jew?

490
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,040
 "Your own nation, your chief priests,

491
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,180
 "they've delivered you over to me.

492
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,680
 "What have you done?'

493
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,780
 "Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world.

494
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,180
 "If my kingdom were of this world,

495
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,220
 "my servants would have been fighting

496
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,760
 "that I might not be delivered over to the Jews,

497
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,320
 "but my kingdom is not from the world.'"

498
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,080
 It's funny, when you read through this dialogue

499
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,360
 between Pilate and Jesus,

500
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,000
 Jesus is very specific, strategic

501
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,480
 about the things that he says.

502
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,040
 And yet there is some element of comedy

503
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,000
 because he never answers Pilate's question straight on.

504
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,440
 Like Pilate's asking, "Are you the king of the Jews?"

505
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,520
 Are you asking or someone else?

506
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,820
 "Well, what have you done?"

507
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,640
 "My kingdom is not of this world."

508
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,160
 So you are a king.

509
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,260
 You say I'm a king.

510
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,880
 Like Jesus consistently avoids the question.

511
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,320
 But in this moment, we should connect his answer

512
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,760
 to the first question.

513
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,520
 Pilate originally asked him, "So you're a king?"

514
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,000
 Jesus looks at him and now says,

515
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,960
 "My kingdom is not of this world."

516
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,280
 He addresses to Pilate that, "Yes, I am a king,

517
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,680
 "but I'm not the kind of king you expect,

518
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,280
 "nor am I the kind of king that you should be worried about.

519
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,740
 "I'm not a threat to Caesar.

520
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,040
 "Like I'm not worried about Roman sovereignty.

521
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,920
 "I don't have military might at my disposal.

522
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,200
 "I'm not exercising political power

523
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,040
 "because I am not here to conflict as an earthly king

524
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,200
 "with the religious leaders.

525
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,620
 "Instead, I am here as a heavenly king

526
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,280
 "to conflict with the evil spirits of this world.

527
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,080
 "I have come to save my people,

528
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,080
 "not just establish an earthly realm."

529
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,640
 You see, he answers in a way

530
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,180
 that exceeds Pilate's personal vantage point.

531
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:31,340
 Because the truth transcends our own perspectives.

532
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,460
 The truth transcends our own perspectives.

533
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,840
 That's the second thing you need to know.

534
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,200
 Like we live in a really complicated

535
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,440
 cultural dynamic right now.

536
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,640
 I'm not sure if you've noticed,

537
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,460
 but our world is more globalized than ever.

538
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,280
 Like through immigration and international travel

539
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,600
 and the internet, we are more connected to other people

540
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
 than we have ever been.

541
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,980
 And because of that, we're connected to a variety

542
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,940
 of religious backgrounds and cultural upbringings

543
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,440
 and ethnic diversities that really provide our world

544
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,020
 with a beautiful level of difference between people.

545
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,300
 It's a globalized society,

546
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,200
 but it's not just a globalized society.

547
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,120
 It's a secularized society.

548
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,680
 Like if you look into the culture,

549
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,540
 you can see at the center of so many conversations

550
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,120
 or issues about sexual identity or gender equality

551
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,600
 or social responsibility or human rights,

552
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,520
 this is the world we live in right now.

553
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,360
 You and I, because of it,

554
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,240
 have been exposed to a broader audience of people

555
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,400
 and as a result, a broader array of perspectives.

556
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,600
 But here's the thing that we need to understand.

557
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,420
 Perspective is not synonymous with truth.

558
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,920
 Perspective is not synonymous with truth.

559
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
 So just take my story from the beginning of the night,

560
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,760
 for example.

561
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,000
 My perspective actually aligned with truth.

562
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,480
 I could make sense of some of the stuff that was happening,

563
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,160
 unknown figures making their way into my house,

564
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,620
 they moved through certain corridors

565
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,920
 until they arrived at a spot that terrified me.

566
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,280
 I could make sense by way of my perspective of some things,

567
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
 but I could not make sense of all things

568
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,660
 because of my perspective.

569
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,320
 There was a greater truth at play.

570
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,860
 And what happened is it led me to think I was being robbed.

571
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,160
 It ultimately almost arrested my roommate

572
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
 and it put us in a position

573
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,540
 where none of the above should have happened.

574
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,540
 Your perspective is not synonymous with truth.

575
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,840
 You see, the truth always transcends our own perspective,

576
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,960
 which when you think about it,

577
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,800
 can be a pretty hard thing to come to grips with.

578
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,240
 Since really all you and I have is our perspective.

579
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,480
 Like your perspective is informed

580
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,520
 by way of the story you have,

581
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,200
 the people you know, the family that's formed you,

582
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,540
 the pain of your past, the things you've endured.

583
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,900
 Your perspective is yours.

584
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,720
 It's been cultivated over the course of time

585
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,420
 and it's led you to a spot where you look at the world

586
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,640
 a very specific way.

587
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,040
 And so to learn that my perspective is insufficient

588
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,240
 to make sense of true reality

589
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,120
 means that I need to draw on something outside of myself

590
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,080
 to make better sense of what's happening in the world.

591
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,320
 Now you can draw on a variety of different things,

592
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,240
 admittedly, there are some things

593
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,120
 that are better than others.

594
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,700
 Like, listen, if you're expecting that guy

595
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,100
 to make sense of your reality,

596
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,900
 he is going to sorely disappoint you.

597
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,600
 Like, have you watched him?

598
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,320
 It's like food and video games.

599
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,120
 You know, you think that's gonna solve

600
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,120
 all of the truth questions that you have in life?

601
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,320
 No, it's not gonna be your job.

602
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,960
 Like your employer has not brought you on

603
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,040
 because they wanna help you solve the big questions

604
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,280
 in life.

605
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
 No, they have brought you on

606
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,640
 because they care about the bottom line

607
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,920
 and the bottom line only.

608
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,360
 Those are not places to look to make sense

609
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,160
 of what's happening in the world

610
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,800
 and what should be true as you survey it.

611
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,920
 This is actually why religion matters.

612
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,520
 Like religion offers a truth claim about reality.

613
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,600
 And I'm not even just talking about Christianity right now,

614
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,320
 I'm just saying religion in general.

615
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,360
 Like that's what it does.

616
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,080
 That's what it serves the purpose for

617
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,300
 is it provides us some semblance of understanding

618
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,440
 what's happening in the world.

619
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,760
 It gives us a truth claim to consider.

620
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,640
 Jesus, he says it like this in John eight,

621
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,040
 he says, "Hey, if you hold to my teaching,

622
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,100
 "you're really my disciples.

623
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,340
 "Then you will know the truth

624
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,080
 "and the truth will set you free."

625
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,220
 Like Jesus is making a claim

626
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,080
 that it's not gonna be his disciples perspective alone

627
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,200
 that leads them to truth,

628
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,280
 that it's gonna be his teaching,

629
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,000
 something outside of themselves

630
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,160
 that's going to help them find the real truth,

631
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,100
 the truth that will ultimately set them free.

632
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,960
 So it begs the question for us,

633
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,340
 what teaching do you choose?

634
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,000
 Like what path do you follow?

635
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,860
 Like don't all religions lead to heaven?

636
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,400
 Don't they all teach the same thing?

637
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,160
 Aren't there multiple routes up the mountain?

638
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,680
 No, there are not.

639
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,560
 Despite how compelling that idea is.

640
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,280
 And listen, I get it.

641
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,360
 The thought of standing here and telling you

642
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,800
 that religion is actually not inclusive in nature

643
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,040
 is a hard thing to say

644
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,860
 because I would love for us to all just link arms

645
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,000
 and sing Kumbaya and get along and no one be judgmental.

646
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,080
 Everybody is welcomed here.

647
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,220
 And yet the reality is that's just not how truth works.

648
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,480
 Like religions, they don't even claim that that is the case.

649
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,120
 Like they're not interested in social harmony

650
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,960
 at the expense of their individual theology.

651
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,180
 So while it might be convenient for us to say

652
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,200
 that all religious paths lead to heaven,

653
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,560
 they provide eternal life,

654
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,960
 that some method of morality,

655
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,880
 whatever it is you prefer,

656
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,160
 will ultimately get you to the pearly gates,

657
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,940
 it's true, it's just not.

658
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,960
 I remember reading a story that Abraham Lincoln

659
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,120
 once had an interaction with a group of people

660
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,740
 on the topic of truth.

661
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,240
 They were highly interested, enthusiastic.

662
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,880
 And so he looked at them and he posed them a famous question.

663
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,620
 He said, how many legs would a sheep have

664
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,120
 if you called its tail a leg?

665
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,780
 They very quickly answered five.

666
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,200
 Then the president looked at them and said, no,

667
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,480
 it would only have four legs.

668
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,200
 Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one.

669
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,120
 Just because you think it's true doesn't mean it is.

670
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,920
 And just because you think all religions get to heaven

671
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,200
 doesn't mean they do.

672
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,800
 And the reality of the matter is

673
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,160
 any orthodox religion will look at you and say,

674
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,620
 we don't believe that either.

675
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,220
 Like I love the way John Tyson, he said it this way,

676
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,100
 all religions make general claims about reality,

677
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,860
 but very specific claims about salvation.

678
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,300
 Why does salvation matter?

679
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,140
 Because salvation leads to eternal life.

680
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,780
 And so all religions have differing positions

681
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,640
 on what it looks like to get to eternal life.

682
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,500
 And those specific claims, they not only differ,

683
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,620
 they matter.

684
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,500
 Like Muslims, they identify good deeds as the goal.

685
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,140
 That's what will achieve everlasting life.

686
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,700
 Buddhists, they focus on self-actualization.

687
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,940
 Christian scientists see salvation as a mental process

688
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,700
 of overcoming material beliefs.

689
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,140
 Hindus achieve salvation by way of one of three things,

690
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,580
 way of works, ways of knowledge, and ways of devotion.

691
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,380
 New-agers, they believe in becoming one with the universe,

692
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,820
 whether through psychedelics or reincarnation.

693
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,060
 And Christians, we believe that salvation

694
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,340
 is found in Christ alone.

695
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,620
 To say that you believe all these things

696
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,740
 lead to eternal life is to actually claim

697
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,140
 that you don't believe any one of them

698
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,020
 leads to eternal life.

699
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,140
 Because if you know them as they are put forward,

700
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,940
 none of them agree with the others.

701
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,300
 Like they take offense to the fact

702
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,260
 that you think all of them could work in harmony

703
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,180
 because they don't.

704
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,540
 Truth is narrow.

705
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,700
 Like truth is a door that unlocks

706
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,140
 according to one key and one key only.

707
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,580
 That's what Jesus said.

708
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,340
 He said this in Matthew 7, he said,

709
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,820
 "Enter by the narrow gate.

710
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,100
 "For the gate is wide, and the way is easy

711
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,020
 "that leads to destruction.

712
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,180
 "And those who enter by it are many.

713
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,260
 "For the gate is narrow, and the way is hard

714
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,500
 "that leads to life, and those who find it are few."

715
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,700
 There's only one path that leads to everlasting life.

716
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,300
 There's only one key that unlocks that door.

717
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,820
 So then what is it?

718
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:14,540
 Like that should be the question boiling up inside.

719
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,780
 Like, okay, Kylan, if everything you're saying is true,

720
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,940
 like if everything you're saying makes sense,

721
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,540
 if this line of logic actually is plausible,

722
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,860
 then what is it?

723
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,380
 What is the truth?

724
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,860
 Well, you were asking the same question Pilot himself has.

725
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,140
 And Jesus gives the answer.

726
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,500
 He says to Pilot's question, "So you're a king?

727
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,940
 "You say that I'm a king.

728
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,400
 "For this purpose, I was born,

729
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,980
 "and for this purpose, I have come into the world

730
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,680
 "to bear witness to the truth.

731
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,980
 "Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."

732
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,100
 And then Pilot asks, "What is truth?"

733
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:52,400
 So just try to think through what Jesus actually said.

734
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,500
 Like it could be easy to just casually move through it

735
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,660
 and just kind of continue on.

736
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,380
 That's another claim of Christ, no big deal.

737
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,820
 What did Jesus actually just say?

738
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,980
 Because it's really radical in nature.

739
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,220
 Like Jesus just made this extravagant claim,

740
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,740
 and yet it's also an extraordinary claim.

741
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,580
 Like he's saying that his voice is the voice

742
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,520
 which equates to truth.

743
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,660
 That if you're looking for truth, it is found in him.

744
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,880
 And yet that's not the only radical claim Jesus makes.

745
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,120
 Like that voice which speaks truth is a voice

746
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,000
 that makes consistently climactic claims

747
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,900
 over the course of his ministry.

748
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,160
 Claims that say things like he claimed to be equal with God.

749
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,400
 He claimed to be the Messiah sent from God.

750
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,360
 He claimed to be the son of man.

751
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,680
 He claimed to give eternal life.

752
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,480
 He claimed to save the world.

753
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,840
 He claimed to forgive sins.

754
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,240
 He claimed to know the father.

755
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,640
 He claimed to fulfill the law.

756
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,520
 He claimed to give rest to the weary and the wandering soul.

757
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,100
 He claimed to have the words of eternal life.

758
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,120
 Those were the words which fell from his lips.

759
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,980
 He claimed to be the future judge,

760
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,080
 the one that we would one day stand before.

761
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,740
 And he claimed to be the great I am.

762
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,320
 And most importantly for this talk,

763
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,880
 he claimed to be the way, the truth, and the life.

764
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,780
 Like no one comes to the father except through him.

765
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,220
 He goes on to say in John 14, verse seven,

766
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,420
 right after that statement, that if you had known me,

767
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,140
 you would have known my father also.

768
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,980
 Why?

769
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,760
 Because from now on, you do know him and you've seen him

770
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,540
 because you've seen me.

771
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,960
 Now, it's really possible to read these claims

772
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,060
 and just think like, okay, man,

773
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,020
 it's just more religious jargon.

774
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,220
 It's just more claims from Christ.

775
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,380
 And yet when we hear things as audacious

776
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,820
 and ridiculous as this, it should cause us to stop

777
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,140
 because people don't speak this way.

778
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,820
 And when people speak this way, we should judge them.

779
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,340
 Kanye West said, "God chose me.

780
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,060
 He made a path for me.

781
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,940
 I am God's vessel, but my greatest pain in life

782
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,780
 is that I will never be able to see myself perform live."

783
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:02,660
 That is a ridiculous claim and it deserves to be judged.

784
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,340
 Cristiano Ronaldo, "People whistle me

785
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:11,340
 because I am good looking, rich, and a great footballer.

786
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,300
 They're jealous of me."

787
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:19,060
 Zlatan Ibrahimovic, when asked what he got his ex-fiance

788
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,620
 for an engagement gift, said, "What do you mean present?

789
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,000
 She got Zlatan."

790
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,940
 Infamously, Drake said, "Last name ever,

791
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,660
 first name greatest."

792
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,500
 That deserves to be judged.

793
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,380
 Like I didn't particularly pick out hip hop artists

794
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,180
 and footballers for that demonstration.

795
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,740
 And yet you just make whatever conclusions you want of it.

796
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,780
 They seem to be the most arrogant of us, you know?

797
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,920
 But when we hear laudy and audacious,

798
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,500
 ridiculous claims like that,

799
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,420
 what it means is we should actually lean in

800
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,580
 and investigate what are you saying and is it true?

801
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:06,180
 Jesus is making an even greater claim.

802
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:13,300
 And the reality of it is he's not stroking his own ego.

803
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,060
 He's not beating his chest.

804
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,280
 He's not trying to acquire followers.

805
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,260
 Jesus is not someone that is interested

806
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,620
 in popularity at all.

807
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,980
 He's interested in the truth.

808
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,980
 That's what Jesus wants.

809
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,780
 He wants it so badly that he would say things that are,

810
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,820
 man, they're wild, but they're wonderful

811
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,920
 because they accord with truth.

812
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,900
 You see, he is addressing himself

813
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,500
 as the answer to life's biggest questions.

814
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,820
 He tells us that he is the source of purpose.

815
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,740
 Like if you're here and you're wanting for purpose,

816
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,940
 if you're looking for meaning,

817
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,540
 if you want fulfillment in life, he's like, "Hey, it's me.

818
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,560
 Like I'm the source of your purpose.

819
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,620
 It's not found anywhere else.

820
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,060
 It's found in me."

821
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,740
 But it's not just that he's giving you the answer

822
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,380
 to where do I find purpose in life?

823
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,220
 He's also looking and saying, "Hey, I actually have

824
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,100
 the solution for your problem in life."

825
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,760
 Like, maybe you don't know,

826
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,100
 your biggest issues are not at work.

827
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,720
 It's not your relationship status.

828
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,980
 Your biggest problem is not the fact

829
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,900
 that your family has some disagreement,

830
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,220
 though those things are legitimate.

831
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,940
 Your biggest problem is that you are lost in sin.

832
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,500
 And yet Jesus is saying, "I'm the solution.

833
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,100
 Yeah, source of your purpose,

834
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,140
 but I'm also the solution for your problem.

835
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,620
 Like I'm the one that could step in the gap

836
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,900
 between you and God, and I can take the hit.

837
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,020
 I can absorb the wrath.

838
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,220
 I can die your death.

839
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,980
 That way you don't have to.

840
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,220
 But I'm not only that, I'm the substitute you need."

841
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,420
 Because the reality is if you reject me,

842
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,540
 you're not enough on your own.

843
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,020
 The truth is you're going to have to pay

844
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,140
 the penalty for your wrong,

845
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,780
 and you're not gonna wanna pay it

846
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,460
 because it's not just today, it's not just tomorrow,

847
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,180
 it's forever and always.

848
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,900
 But I can be the substitute that you're today

849
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,580
 and your tomorrow and your forever and always

850
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,020
 can be different.

851
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,140
 That it's not a life of eternal condemnation,

852
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,740
 it's a life of everlasting bliss.

853
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:10,700
 But I'm not only that, I'm also your salvation forever.

854
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,500
 Like I'm the one that doesn't just lead you to heaven,

855
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,020
 that doesn't just give you everlasting life.

856
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,560
 I'm the one that gives you God.

857
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,220
 Do you want Him?

858
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,460
 Do you want a connection to your creator?

859
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,580
 A relationship to your maker?

860
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,340
 It's available.

861
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,660
 And it's available through me.

862
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,020
 That's what Jesus has claimed to you is.

863
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,260
 He is the truth.

864
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,020
 He wants us to know.

865
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,140
 Like there is an objective truth,

866
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,140
 and its name is Jesus.

867
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:55,500
 Here's the thing, declarations like that

868
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,580
 they demand a decision from us.

869
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,780
 You cannot hear those things

870
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,740
 and then just indifferently pass by.

871
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,780
 It's confronting, it's conflicting,

872
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,620
 it is a moment of consequence.

873
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:18,580
 C.S. Lewis said it like this in his book,

874
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,420
 Mere Christianity, he said,

875
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,340
 "I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying

876
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,780
 "the really foolish thing that people often say about Him,"

877
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,100
 I'm talking about Jesus.

878
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,240
 "I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher,

879
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,520
 "but I don't accept His claim to be God.

880
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,060
 "That is the one thing we must not say.

881
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,180
 "A man who is merely a man and said the sort of things

882
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,180
 "Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.

883
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,180
 "He would either be a lunatic on a level with the man

884
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,560
 "who says he's a poached egg,

885
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,480
 "or else he would be the devil of hell.

886
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,140
 "You must make your choice.

887
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,900
 "Either this man was and is the son of God,

888
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,420
 "or else a madman or something worse."

889
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,860
 You can shut him up, call him a fool,

890
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,700
 spit at him and kill him as a demon,

891
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
 or you can fall at his feet

892
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,200
 and you can call him Lord and God.

893
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,320
 But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense

894
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,360
 about him being a great human teacher.

895
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,380
 He has not left that open to us.

896
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,660
 He did not intend to.

897
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,520
 This is the sort of man that Pilate is facing

898
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,740
 in this passage.

899
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,580
 I don't think he knew it

900
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,180
 when he first began the conversation,

901
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,500
 but by the end of it,

902
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,740
 when he asks the question, what is truth,

903
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,320
 staring back at him is the face of it himself.

904
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,320
 And yet what we see is Pilate in the subsequent chapters,

905
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,620
 chooses not to accord his life with objective truth.

906
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:50,900
 Instead, he bends it to accommodate his preferences

907
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,640
 and appeal to the approval of others.

908
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,980
 Pilate sacrifices truth

909
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,860
 on the altar of momentary satisfaction.

910
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:09,100
 And yet the reality is,

911
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:13,420
 here tonight we are still face to face with that same man,

912
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,620
 because that man, though condemned to die

913
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,380
 and buried for three days, rose forth from the grave.

914
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,080
 And he looks at you this evening

915
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,060
 the way he looked at Pilate,

916
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,480
 and he asks, do you want to know what truth is?

917
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,380
 It's me.

918
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,020
 You're looking at it.

919
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,620
 Yes, you can move through this world,

920
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,620
 and you can accommodate your comforts.

921
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,420
 You can appeal to your preferences.

922
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,180
 You can choose to indulge whatever desire you have

923
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,640
 and whatever truth allows for it.

924
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,860
 But there's really only one truth,

925
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,420
 and it's the truth I come to give.

926
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,620
 It's the truth that I offer to all.

927
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,640
 Do you want to believe in me?

928
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,660
 Now you may hear something like that and think to yourself,

929
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,440
 why should I listen to you?

930
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,260
 Christianity is such an exclusive religion.

931
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,540
 Like it's such a restrictive philosophy.

932
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,300
 Like it's such an impossible path to believe.

933
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,580
 Why would I choose to follow this?

934
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,980
 Here's what I would tell you,

935
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,700
 that although Christianity may seem exclusive,

936
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,880
 Jesus is wildly inclusive.

937
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,980
 Like he does not exclude anyone

938
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,980
 on the basis of their social status or their intelligence,

939
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,420
 their gender, their race, their nationality,

940
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,900
 or anything else.

941
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,220
 He invites all people to be a part of his family,

942
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,580
 to follow him where it is he's going.

943
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,380
 The only thing that Jesus excludes

944
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,260
 is on the basis of sin,

945
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,980
 which he's come to take away forever,

946
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,840
 if only you would repent and believe.

947
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,260
 You might look at Christianity and say it's so restrictive,

948
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,660
 yet Jesus has come to set us free.

949
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,940
 Like he does not seek to restrict us

950
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,860
 with outward rules and regulations.

951
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,940
 He only restricts us from vainly reconciling ourselves

952
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,020
 to God according to whatever works we can muster up.

953
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,980
 He's like, you're not enough, you can't do it.

954
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,420
 And yet what I will do is I will give you liberty in life,

955
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,240
 abundant joy, great forgiveness,

956
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,040
 by living the life you can and dying the death you deserve.

957
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,020
 And although Christianity may seem impossible to believe,

958
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,620
 Jesus has made it possible to believe.

959
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,860
 Like, yes, these are impossible claims,

960
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,980
 like never ending life, abounding joy,

961
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,300
 unfailing purposes, forgiving grace.

962
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,140
 Like you're telling me that stuff is available.

963
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,500
 That seems too wild.

964
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,700
 That seems too crazy.

965
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,820
 That doesn't seem possible.

966
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,620
 And yet Jesus is looking at you saying, oh, it's possible

967
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,620
 because that's what I come to give.

968
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,780
 That's the truth I seek to speak.

969
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,220
 That's the kind of life I'm willing to offer

970
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,020
 if you will take it up and follow me.

971
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,220
 And yet they are only impossible to believe

972
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,380
 for those that do not believe in him.

973
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,580
 Porch, this world is filled with alternative truths

974
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,220
 that will fail you in this life.

975
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,260
 But there's one objective truth,

976
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,500
 the person of Jesus that will never fail you.

977
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,740
 If you're looking for truth, why look any longer?

978
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,580
 He's standing here up front you tonight

979
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,400
 and he's calling you to believe.

980
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,040
 Let me pray for us.

981
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,220
 God, thanks for tonight.

982
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,260
 Thanks for these people.

983
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,700
 Thanks for your word and the sufficiency therein.

984
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,980
 I'm grateful, God, that you have given us truth, man.

985
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,500
 I just think, Lord, like what would my life be like

986
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,140
 if I didn't know truth?

987
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,500
 There was a time when I didn't.

988
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,380
 And what I know, God, is in those days,

989
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:01,300
 as I look back in reflection, I was so very lost,

990
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,100
 so very alone, desperately trying to find my hope

991
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,900
 and home and things that promised yet never delivered.

992
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,900
 And yet when I met you, Christ, I find all of that and more.

993
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,500
 I pray you would come and give that tonight.

994
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,580
 I pray that God, friends here in the room,

995
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,580
 would receive it.

996
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,500
 I don't know, God.

997
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,960
 I have no doubt that people have been through so much

998
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,820
 when it comes to their religious past,

999
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,340
 their experiences in spirituality,

1000
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,460
 the impact of Christians in their life

1001
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,260
 that would lead them, God, to be hesitant

1002
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,860
 to embrace the claims of Christ

1003
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,860
 and accept his truth, the truth, for themselves.

1004
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,560
 And yet, God, I pray you would soften them here,

1005
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,360
 gently warm their hearts,

1006
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,840
 quickly attune their ears to hear your voice,

1007
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,020
 which calls them out of death

1008
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,240
 and into life.

1009
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,940
 What is truth?

1010
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:17,140
 The truth is you, Jesus,

1011
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,380
 that only by your blood are all men saved.

1012
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,020
 We love you and we sing to you now.

1013
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,340
 It is in Christ's name we pray, amen.
