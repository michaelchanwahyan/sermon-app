[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [video] >> Good evening, here with the CEO of Google.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   >> Good evening, here in Dallas. We've never met before. My name is Garrett. I typically
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160]   spend my Tuesday nights about 40 miles west over in Fort Worth. So hey to our satellite
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.960]   audience in Fort Worth and in Houston. And we want everyone tuning in to know that there's
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.360]   a new group gathering in North Houston in the woodlands. And so that's starting just
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.360]   tonight for the Porch Live down in the woodlands. So glad that all you guys are with us this
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.040]   evening. I'm gonna read the text that we're gonna be in tonight and then pray one more
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.840]   time and we'll get started.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.840]   First Corinthians chapter 6, starting in verse 15. "Do you not know that your bodies are
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:15.360]   members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute?
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.600]   Never. Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her?
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.680]   For as it is written, the two will become one flesh. But he who is joined to the Lord
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.680]   becomes one spirit with him. Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.240]   is outside the body. But the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.480]   not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you? Whom you have from
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.480]   God you are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body."
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.920]   Let's pray together one more time. God, I pray that we would glorify you in body and
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.600]   thought, in spirit, in truth, completely God, that we would honor you, that we would be
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   attentive to your word this evening. We trust you to meet us. In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.400]   Well, when I was in high school, one night I walked into church. The only background
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.960]   you would need to know is that I was not a church person. I had been around church kind
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.760]   of when I was a kid, you know, Christmas, Easter, and I guess any other time that my
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.280]   dad took me or my mom took me, which was not super frequently. And so when I was in high
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.120]   school, I didn't even pretend to have a relationship with Jesus. I didn't pretend to bring his
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.800]   morals, his teaching, his book into my life. I did not even pretend. I wouldn't even imitate
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.320]   a Christian. And so I walk into church one night, I guess I just want to say hi and like
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.720]   see some friends. I was completely living an immoral lifestyle, partying, sex, whatever
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.400]   I wanted to do. And unbeknownst to my loved ones. And so that's kind of where I was living
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.640]   and hanging out. And I go to church one night and it's a Wednesday night, you know, small
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.560]   town Baptist church. I lived in small town, Texas. And we're having this thing at the
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.020]   church that night, which I rarely attended called true love waits. I'm like, okay, what
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.080]   is this true love waits thing? And so I just kind of wander in, it feels a little different.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.320]   The normal youth pastors not there. There's some like new guy in there. And it's like
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.040]   some dude in his twenties with a microphone attached to his face. And he's like, you know
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.680]   how that goes. And so I see him, I'm like, who is this guy? And come to find out true
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.960]   love waits. It's like a sexual purity rally. I'm at a sexual purity pep rally. I'm like,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.740]   oh no, this is not good. And this guy, this guy stands up there and he starts to say crazy
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.640]   things that he claims the Bible says crazy things, things that I could not like put together
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.040]   or even begin to accept, not even close. And so he started to say things like, um, sex
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.320]   is for marriage. One man, one woman. He started to say that there was, um, no oral sex would
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.480]   be pleasing to God outside of marriage. Like fantasy is not going to help you masturbation,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.000]   stealth simulation, manual stimulation, any kind of simulation. He's just like wrecking
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.520]   my whole operation. I'm like, I'm like, I got, this guy's leaving me no options. I hate
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.220]   this guy right now. I have no idea like what to do and no kidding. And so like I'm sitting
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.720]   there in my seat and I'm like, I don't know why, like, I don't know why he's telling me
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.600]   these things. I don't know why that's important. Like, how could that be important? And so
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.800]   I'm like arguing with him in my head. I'm like, okay, clearly this guy's never had sex.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.960]   Let's give him a break. I'm like, okay. Um, is that even healthy? I mean, is it like even
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.840]   healthy? Is it even possible for like a post pubescent male to even make it through life
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.880]   without having sex? Is that even like a reality? And so I'm like scratching my head. I'm arguing
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.680]   with him. I'm like, this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. I'm not
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.920]   okay with this. This is not okay. And I just had no answers for why. And I don't know how
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.520]   well he communicated that night. Honestly, I was just closed off. I didn't care. It didn't
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.400]   matter. Maybe he said it and I couldn't hear it. Maybe he didn't say why. And therefore
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.320]   I didn't hear it. But I do know that I could not figure out why purity, that word. I was
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.660]   so entrenched in my own lifestyle and in my own choices that the word itself sounded like
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:16.160]   nails on a chalkboard to me. True story. It bothered me. And tonight in a great irony,
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   here we are and we are going to talk about sexual purity. And I want you to know I consider
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:33.240]   it a great privilege. I'm so excited about it. And I know tonight that you may be where
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.800]   I was. Like some of you, I know you're going to walk out of here and like you're going
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.560]   to have sex tonight. Like I know, maybe I'll scare you out of it for one night, maybe tomorrow
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.120]   night. I don't know. Some of you are like closed off, like 100% closed off. It doesn't
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.600]   matter what I say. I could beg, plead, yell. I could do anything. And it's just not going
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.680]   to convince you. But I hope even if you're there, I hope you'll at least be able to answer
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.720]   the question that I could not. Why? Why purity? Even if you don't believe it, even if you're
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.040]   not ready to walk in it, I hope that you'll at least know why purity. So we'll be in one
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.000]   of the most famous passages on sexuality in the New Testament, 1 Corinthians chapter six.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.600]   So Paul is writing to Corinthian Christians who are about as impure as you can get sexually.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.840]   And he writes some things that will explain if we look closely, why purity is so critical.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.640]   So 1 Corinthians chapter six, verse 15. Do you not know, he just assumes people know
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:34.320]   these things. We don't, we need help. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   Do you not know that your body, like a body part, like your body is just one body part.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.640]   Your whole body is one body part attached to Christ. Shall I then take what is Christ
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.600]   because you're attached to him? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.800]   of a prostitute? Do I really want to be the link in the chain that holds together prostitution,
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.880]   immorality and Christ? Do I want to be the link in the chain that holds that together?
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.640]   He says, never. Or do you not know, he loves to use this phrase. You're going to have to
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.600]   get used to that tonight. Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.520]   one body with her? You're like, I knew that one. That's like a one body thing. Two bodies
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.880]   become one body. For as it is written, and he quotes Genesis, the two will become one
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:29.560]   flesh. God's original design before sin, God's pro-sex, he created sex. And it says, you're
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:42.600]   the one I'm worried about. I got 30 minutes to do this people. Let's go. For as it is
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.400]   written, the two will become one flesh, God's design. But he put it in a particular place
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.840]   for a particular reason. The first reason for why purity is very simple. They all are
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.200]   one because sex is powerful. Sex is powerful. I hope you remember that. I hope you don't
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.600]   ever forget it. Sex is powerful. You're like, oh, I know. No, that's not what I mean. I
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:08.880]   mean on a deeper level, it's powerful. So the men in Corinth who were Christians had
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.000]   about as loose of a sexual ethic as you could possibly have. And so if you were in Corinth,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.400]   they were basically running the liberal experiment of the day. And so you can do anything you
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.000]   want and nobody's allowed to tell you that your sexual desire is wrong. I don't know
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.360]   if that sounds familiar, but in Corinth, it was a land where you could claim anything
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.760]   you wanted for your sexual preference and no one was able to tell you no. And so the
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.880]   Corinthian Christian men, Christian men, not just men, Christian men would consider it
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.040]   totally okay, totally permissible to have sex with their wife. And then if they were
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.680]   feeling like they needed a release or she was feeling uncreative or maybe had that headache,
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.920]   you know, that comes around. And so maybe if that was going on, they could just go right
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:48.000]   on down to the prostitute, to a prostitute and get whatever they wanted and pay money
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.880]   for it. And so that was considered perfectly acceptable. It was like, oh, my body needs
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.040]   this. And so I'm going to go do that. And Paul speaks to that and he says, don't you
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.040]   know you're attached to Christ? This thing is so much more powerful than you think it
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:05.280]   is. You are attached to the living God, physically, spiritually, emotionally. You are messing
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.600]   with something that is far more powerful than you think you are. God designed it to bring
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:18.720]   two bodies together. There is no greater act of intimacy. It is powerful. And some things
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.680]   are really just too powerful to play with, too powerful to take a chance on.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.080]   I've got some family in East Texas. That's where I grew up and way East Texas. Okay.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.840]   So I grew up, I'm going to lose trust with some of you, but I'm talking about like, I
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.680]   grew up shooting guns, riding horses, trucks. I loved them. I lost my accent when I moved
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.720]   to the city, but you know, it comes out whenever I go down there. So we go down there every
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.960]   once in a while and we still like to shoot guns for fun. And so, and the occasional explosive,
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.160]   you never know. There's lots of pastries out there. I'm not making this up. Some of you
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.880]   guys are like, are you serious? I'm so serious. And so, we will, we'll go out there and enjoy
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.080]   that every once in a while. And we have something that we do every single time. It's so simple.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.200]   We never even think about it. We just do it. When we get the guns, we got to get them out
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.920]   of something right out of a box with a lock. We got to get it out of the safe because you
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.960]   don't just leave powerful things laying around. You don't just leave something that's really
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.120]   powerful where somebody could just like trip over it and then injure themselves. You don't
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.480]   leave something that's really powerful in the hands of someone who could abuse it. You
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.360]   don't leave something that's really powerful in a place where it's going to allow people
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:28.360]   that you love to be hurt. God put something powerful in a specific place for a specific
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:35.900]   reason, namely safety. And I know that sounds crazy. That sounds constricting. That sounds
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.600]   like a preacher's trick. You're not having it. Listen, let me ask you something. Let's
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.840]   pretend for a second that you were God. Like you're in charge and you're looking at the
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:50.360]   world and you can see what we as a human race have done with sex. And by the way, if you're
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.360]   God, you love every human. That's part of the requirement. And so you're looking at
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.400]   a planet full of people that you love and you see STDs, you see AIDS, gonorrhea, syphilis,
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   you see it all. You see rape, you see intimidation, you see pain and abuse. And then you have
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:16.080]   the option to choose that or you can put sex in marriage only, like lock it and throw away
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.680]   the key. What would you do? You'd put it in the safe. That's exactly what you would do.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:28.200]   Be careful before you blame God. He's looking for your good. Sex is powerful. He puts it
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.600]   in a specific place for a good reason. He is not holding out on you. He is protecting
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   you. But it's not just a powerful physical act. It's more than that. It goes even further.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:50.000]   Look at verse 17. "But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one," what? What was it?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.840]   Spirit. "He who is joined to the Lord becomes one," all the campuses, "becomes one spirit
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.840]   with him. Flee sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body,
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.740]   but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body." In other words, there's something
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:13.740]   uniquely deep striking about sexual mistakes. There's something that's uniquely powerful
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:21.240]   on the upside when sex is used appropriately. Sex is an act of the soul 100% of the time.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:28.520]   So we already know, hey, if you have sex with a prostitute, one body. But just like you're
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.140]   in a spiritual union with Christ, when you have a sexual interaction of any kind, of
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.960]   any kind, even against yourself, you are going to damage yourself or another person if you
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:44.000]   do that outside the safe place that God has designed it to be. And it is a spiritual act.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   It may be bodies that are moving, and there should be if you're having sex. But you're
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.280]   not just moving your body. You're touching someone's soul. You are using that body. You
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:04.200]   are using their body to move their soul. That is what sex is. There is no such thing
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:10.160]   as a sexual act that is not spiritual. That's like just by definition. Like you cannot,
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:17.160]   cannot ever have sex that's just physical. It's always spiritual. That's my second point
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:24.360]   tonight. Why purity? Why purity? One, sex is powerful. Number two, sex is not just physical.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:31.080]   It is not just physical. And our world and our culture promotes sex as purely physical.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.880]   You ever heard that? Oh, it's just physical. I heard that recently, really recently. Hey,
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.720]   man, is that girl, are you dating that girl? No, man, we're just hooking up. Just a physical
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   thing. Incorrect. That's not true. No, you're not. It's always spiritual 100% of the time.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.520]   Your union to Christ is not just physical, it's spiritual. So it is with sex. The world
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.580]   you see, if you are in a sexual relationship, the world you see and the world that you see
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:06.160]   that you're manipulating affects a world you cannot see. Namely the immaterial part of
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:12.880]   a person, the non-material part of a person. That thing that makes you human. That thing
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.160]   that creates emotion. That part about you that's you. I mean, really you. Did you know
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.320]   that you don't, that you're not a body? You, I mean you, you. Like your name, who you are,
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:30.320]   you're not a body. You just have a body. You are a soul. That's who you are. And if you're
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:38.760]   having sex with a person, for better or for worse, inside of marriage or out, by very
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.480]   definition, the act is a spiritual act. You cannot have sex and have it not be spiritual.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.000]   Now when you get inside of a marriage and you start to pursue it, you would be better
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.120]   off to pursue it in the spiritual sense because it's meant to be intimacy that brings two
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.720]   people together, not just a physical act. But 100% of the time, for better or worse,
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.080]   you are committing a spiritual act. Trying to have sex and not getting spiritual is like
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.200]   trying to jump out of a boat in the ocean and not get wet. Like that's just not gonna
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   happen. There's no way. When someone has damaged themselves, and they've been hurt, and they've
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.880]   been hurt, when someone has damaged themselves, or when someone, think about this, so I work
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.880]   on a church staff and that means I get to have a lot of conversations with folks that
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:25.220]   I love a ton. And when someone pulls me aside and they say, "Psst, I gotta tell you something."
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.800]   They're not about to tell me that they're sad that they talked back to mama when they
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.240]   were nine. They're about to tell me that something that they did with their body, "Hey, psst,
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   I've never told anybody this before. I don't feel good about it." It's because of a sexual
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   act that has damaged them deep within. It's not unhealable. And I'm not trying to discourage
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.000]   you. I just want us to agree on one thing is best for Abel. Sex is powerful and it's
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.560]   not just physical. And I hate it when people think that it's just physical and pretend
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.520]   it's just physical because we don't even believe it. I promise you, we don't even believe it.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.480]   When it really gets down to it, we don't even believe it. Let me show you. Pretend for a
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.600]   second. This is gonna be kind of dark. I'm warning you. It's gonna make you feel kind
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.960]   of weird. But imagine the person that you love a lot decides to cheat on you and then
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.520]   the person they cheated on you with comes to you and they say, "Hey, bro, I'm sorry,
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:23.520]   man. It was just physical. I'm sure you understand." Oh no, bro. It's gonna be physical when I
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:29.480]   hit you in the mouth. That's when it's gonna be just physical. We know. The problem here
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   is that there was a heart exchange. You took the deepest part of my person and the deepest
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.120]   part of my person went to you. That's not okay. I'm not okay with that. It's not just
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:44.120]   physical. You don't even believe that. It's not just physical. In fact, so think through
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:50.440]   this with me. And I wanna be gentle with your story. I don't wanna pretend to have fast
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.080]   answers or fast solutions. If you told me your story, it would probably take a while
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.200]   and it would probably leave us both in a sensitive place. And so I don't wanna just dive into
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:05.640]   that and pretend I know what you've been through. But I do know this. Just by pattern recognition,
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.320]   if someone has been harmed physically, like an altercation, like a fight, like an assault,
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.840]   something like that, they are likely, not every time, but they are likely to bounce
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:21.840]   back quicker than someone who has experienced sexual abuse. And that's the story for many
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:27.720]   of you. Statistics on women would say one in four. That's a lot of women in this room
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:33.320]   and many men in this room. And if you are one of those affected, or even if you were
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:39.400]   a former offender, you know that there's something about that wrong that just goes deeper than
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   your skin. There's something about that that just doesn't sit right with you. It's because
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:51.680]   sex is not just physical. It is powerful. It is spiritual by definition. But the good
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:58.680]   news is God designed it to be that way and it's recoverable. Let's look at verse 19.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:10.120]   Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you? That is good
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:17.080]   news. Whom you have from God. And so God has decided that he's not just gonna sit back
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.640]   and be angry at anybody. He's gonna give us a good gift, like help us combat this problem
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.520]   that we've adopted onto ourselves. And it says God has given us the Holy Spirit who
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.560]   lives within us. The word temple just means like a dwelling place. And it's rich in biblical
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:36.120]   terms because in the Old Testament times, the temple was not something that could house
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:43.120]   God because God is infinitely, he is unsizeable, he is immaterial himself. God is spirit. But
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:50.040]   the temple was the symbol of God's dwelling place. And so the temple is you, if you are
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:56.040]   a believer in Christ, your body is the dwelling place of God and the sign to the rest of the
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:03.040]   world that God's here. You are not your own. Now that is about as anti-American as it gets.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:10.520]   You are not your own. You are not in charge of you. For you were bought with a price.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.200]   Someone bought you. Someone bought you. Not a slave master, someone who is here to set
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   you free. For you were bought with a price. So, so glorify your free loving God with your
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:30.040]   body. This is the most encouraging part for me, the most. You see right there where it
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:35.240]   says the Holy Spirit within you? You would wanna know that the Holy Spirit is a gift
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.560]   that God gives when he wants to give something good. Anytime God, someone needs help. If
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.880]   someone, when David had sinned sexually, Psalm 51, renew a right spirit within me. When God
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:51.480]   promised to help the people of the Old Testament follow his statutes or rules or laws, he said,
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:58.480]   I will put my spirit within you and then you will walk in my law. Jesus said, unless I
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:05.000]   leave, the helper won't come. Meaning the spirit of God, if I, if Jesus says, when I
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.840]   physically leave this planet and I will, I am gonna send the helper, the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.520]   He is gonna help you. He's not gonna condemn you. He is going to help you. God is going
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:22.520]   to give you a helper. Acts 1 8, right around the time the church began, it says, Jesus
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:30.840]   huddled with the disciples, said, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.640]   you. The Holy Spirit being in this equation is a good thing because I don't know about
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.360]   you, but someone telling me that sex is powerful and someone telling me that sex is spiritual
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.400]   and it's never just physical sometimes can make me feel guilty and it can make me feel
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.720]   like I'm trapped. But if the Holy Spirit enters the equation, it doesn't have to be that way
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.040]   because it says in the scripture where the spirit of the Lord is, that's where freedom
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:58.040]   is. And so this is where he enters the text in you. This means that God is not just sitting
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:06.600]   back. Do you see who God is? He's not just sitting back, tapping his foot, angry at this
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.880]   world, angry at you, angry for where you're stuck and giving you instructions and hoping
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.760]   you get it right and angry when you can't figure out the equation. He is giving you
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:23.760]   help. Amazing. So my third point is that because of this purity is possible. It's possible.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:30.320]   I'd want you to know that because I know some of you are discouraged to the point where
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.800]   you just say, hey, I see it. I already knew it wasn't just physical. I already knew it
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.960]   was powerful and I've already made enough mistakes and I've already repetitively made
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   enough mistakes. Worse and worse. Sometimes it's not getting better. It'll be a little
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.280]   better and then it's worse, worse, a little better. And then it's just not worth it anymore.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.600]   I don't even think this thing is possible. If the Holy Spirit is here, why are you going
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.200]   to argue with the Bible? I mean, it says where the spirit is, there's freedom. And then it
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.000]   says that the spirit is in you. So that means freedom is in you. If I'm putting that together,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.440]   right. And you're sitting there saying that freedom can't be in you. Be careful. Purity
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:10.120]   is possible. Do not give up. God is not demanding the impossible and laughing when you can't
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:16.480]   do it. That is not who he is. I rented apartments for a decade. And so I just bought my first
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.760]   home. I rented apartments for a decade. I have never had a landlord move in with me
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:26.400]   to help me ever. They just sit back and ask for the rent. That's what they do. I've had
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.640]   old ones, young ones, men, women for a decade. I've rented a lot of houses. I've had a lot
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.320]   of roommates. I have never had a landlord move in and help me pay my rent or organize
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.120]   my life or make sure I was putting one step in front of the other. God is nothing like
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:46.360]   a landlord. He is an owner and a tenant because he moves in with us to help us with what we
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:53.120]   need. God will not demand from you what he will not provide for you. He will not demand
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.400]   a sexual ethic from you that he will not enable you to take on. It says no temptation is so
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:08.080]   great that you can't stand up under it. It's possible. God demands purity. There's no question.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.680]   But he offers forgiveness for what's already been done and he offers hope for what's ahead.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:22.880]   So in summary, why purity? Because sex is powerful. Sex is not just physical. And purity
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:29.600]   is possible. I'd love for you as we close tonight just to see a living example of what
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.720]   God has done for me. And I'd want to tell you up front, please hear this. God is so
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.240]   creative he will never do anything in the same way twice. Okay? And so whatever redemption
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.200]   he offered me, maybe it looks like that for you. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe it looks different.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.800]   I have no idea. And so I'm not going to limit God and I'm also not going to put a minimum
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.640]   on God. I have no idea what he will do with you. But as it says in the New Testament,
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.840]   I can't help but say what I've seen and heard. And so I'm going to show you a before and
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.800]   an after. Okay? So here's the before of my life. I've already told you a little bit about
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:08.200]   it when I walked out of church the night we were talking about sexual purity. But I was
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.840]   completely disengaged from any idea of biblical sexuality. I used sex to make me feel like
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:21.200]   a man. I used sex to create my own pride. I let it separate me from God because I worshipped
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:30.000]   sex more than God. I did all that. I developed an addiction to pornography and with that
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.880]   and suffered a breakup. And so previously I'd been so prideful I thought I could use
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.440]   my words to get anything I wanted. And then all of a sudden someone broke up with me and
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.400]   all the mountain of pride I built for myself turned into a valley of insecurity. I was
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.640]   completely lost, turned to pornography where I could always win, developed a crushing addiction
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:53.920]   to pornography. And I was so lost, I'm not exaggerating, I choose these words carefully,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.640]   I literally wished that God would have created the world without men and women to interact
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:04.920]   in this way. That's how bad I was burned. That's true. That's the before. You got that
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:11.480]   image in your head? Let me tell you the after. My wife and I dated for about a year and during
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.960]   that time we weren't perfect, we did our best. We talked a lot with our community groups
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.480]   and the people around us and asked for a lot of support and sent a lot of text messages
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.960]   and lots of just help and prayer and just we did our best. And it just so happens that
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.000]   our first kiss came at an opportune moment and I know it's kind of a private thing but
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:48.200]   I figured I'd share it with you. What I'm trying to do here is I'm not trying to show
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.580]   you that I cleaned myself up, I didn't. I hope you heard what I just said, I didn't.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.340]   And I hope you are also not hearing me say that if you be pure there could be a moment
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:02.960]   like this. That's not the deal. You can't hold God to a deal that he's never made. That's
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:09.440]   not my point. I am trying to show you, not a moment. Can we show the photo one more time?
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:15.340]   I'm not even trying to show you a moment. I am trying to show you the power of a God
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.800]   who can change a life. And there's plenty about the moment that I like. I love it. I
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.280]   love the pretty girl, I love the beach, the guys on the right, that's my brother, my roommate,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.400]   they're like, "Oh, I love this." And then you got the girls on the left, they're like,
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:33.400]   "Oh my gosh, that's great, but he better calm down." And so like, you get... I love,
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:39.960]   I love the moment, but I'm not showing you this to create desire for a moment. I'm trying
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.640]   to tell you that's a changed man. All I can do is tell you that God changed me. I have
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:52.240]   no idea, that was three weeks ago, I have no idea how he didn't kiss. I have no idea,
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:59.240]   but just the power of God. Last bit of cleanup. I'm not telling you that you should wait to
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:06.040]   kiss until your wedding day. I'm not creating any rules tonight, okay? We wanted to do what
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.960]   was helpful. Look up above verse 15, it says, "All things are lawful, but not all things
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.000]   are helpful." We wanted to choose what was helpful and that was helpful for us. And so
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.560]   we're not creating a rule tonight. That's just where we landed. And through an imperfect
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:25.560]   journey, God was able to preserve us. God can change anyone. There's not a person that
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:35.400]   he can't change. There's not a past he can't forgive. And I have no idea what your future
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.160]   little snapshot might look like. It doesn't matter. I don't have any idea what that could
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.520]   look like, but I know this, God is in the business of providing for people what he demands
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:51.480]   from people. I know that God is in the business of forgiving our iniquities to the highest
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:58.480]   degree. I know that God is so kind that he is going to be the reason why we make it.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.120]   And I know when you think about your journey with purity, if you even consider yourself
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:08.240]   to be on one, that if you look up for too long and see how many steps you have to go,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   that it can just get overwhelming and it can feel impossible. It is not impossible. It
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:23.240]   is impossible. God can do anything. That is why, that is why the New Testament says of
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:30.280]   God, "Now to the God who is able to keep you from stumbling." That's what it says. And
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:36.400]   so the question tonight, to be really frank with you, and I don't want to lose our opportunity
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:43.160]   here, the question tonight is not whether God is good. The question tonight is not whether
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:49.880]   God is even pro-sex in the right, safe, specific way. The question tonight is not whether God
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.920]   intends good for your future. The question tonight is not even whether God is able to
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:00.440]   keep you from stumbling. The question tonight is simply, do you believe him? Do you believe
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:05.440]   that God is capable of these things? Do you believe, or are you talking yourself out of
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.280]   it somehow? Like, "Oh, that doesn't apply to me. My sin's too great. Way to go, Pastor
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.200]   Boy. I'm sure he's just showing off." Are you using some way to like talk your way out
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   of it? Open your heart to the God who can change you. And he can, and he will. He's
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   available tonight for you. He loves you. He made you. He made your body. That means 100%
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   of it. He made everything about you, and he's here to redeem. Let me pray that he would.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:44.040]   Father, thank you, God, that you are so perfect and so pure and so holy that it taxes our
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:53.960]   faith, God, to think of you as this kind. It taxes our belief, our ability to believe
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   that you would be so kind to us. It is hard, God, for us to believe, to trust that you
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:09.600]   are as good as you say you are. God, thank you that the very first scripture that you
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.480]   helped me memorize was 1 Corinthians 6.18, "Flee from the immorality that's gonna wage
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:20.480]   war against my soul." I pray somebody would know that scripture tonight. Thank you, Father,
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:27.160]   that you reach out your hands, that you are slow to anger and abounding in love and steadfast
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   and long-suffering, and you do not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:39.240]   to our iniquities, but as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is your love
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:46.240]   for those who fear you. So, God, I pray we would not just revere you out of fear, God,
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:52.280]   but that we would trust you because your heart is good. Thank you for the redemption that
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.160]   you're doing in this room, in Fort Worth and in Houston, in the woodlands and around this
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:02.600]   globe, not because of anything that any human has ever done, but just because you desire
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:07.600]   to redeem. In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:13.340]   Well, there's gonna be a group of people that are wearing a porch t-shirt that gather right
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:19.920]   up here, guys and girls, and here's the deal. They are of wildly different backgrounds.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.040]   Most of them have tasted some of the bitterness of the world in some way. And so, find someone
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.400]   to chat with if you'd like to. They'll be up here to pray with you or to answer any
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.600]   questions that you might have. If you just wanna open the scripture with someone, you
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.920]   can meet us right here.
