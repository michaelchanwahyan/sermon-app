1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 I mean, he's practically dating a model.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 She told me they went to Cabo and he paid for the whole thing.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Dude, she does his laundry and cooks.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 He proposed at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Bro, she plays in his fantasy football league and knows more about the Cowboys than he does.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 She's got the husband, the house, she's got it all.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 What more could you ask for?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 So, welcome everybody to The Porch. My name is Adam.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Welcome to everybody in Fort Worth, everybody in Houston, downtown.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Really excited to be here with you guys as we continue this relationship series.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 So, anyway, I want to start off with a story tonight.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 And I want to tell you guys a story about the first time I ever told a girl, "I love you."

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Alright? It was 8th grade.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And her name was Julie.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And so, I'd been going with Julie for a couple of weeks.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Honestly, I knew at the time and I know it now.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Julie was a rebound. It was a rebound relationship.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Because I'd had another incident a few weeks earlier with a girl named Jessica.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 But anyway, so I'm going with Julie.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And so, going together for us in 8th grade, I don't know what it was like for you in 8th grade.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 But for me in 8th grade, it just meant like holding hands in the hallway.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Maybe hugs before second period or something like that.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And it meant a lot of conversations on the phone, late at night, talking about nothing.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Okay? And so, in this one night, it was a Friday night.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And Julie and I are on the phone.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And we're talking about, I mean, we're just talking about nothing.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I mean, we're talking about TV and all that kind of stuff.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 "Oh my gosh, you like Full House too?" "Yeah, me too. Uncle Jesse." Right?

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And so, we're talking about that.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And so, somewhere in that conversation, I just decided, "Hey, now it's time to get off the phone.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 We've got to go to bed." All that kind of stuff. It's getting late.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And I'm going to tell her I love her.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Because I feel like I love her.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And so, we're on the phone.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And I'm like, "Hey, I've got to go. It's 11.30. I've got to get up tomorrow."

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And she's like, "Hehe, okay."

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And so, I was like, "Julie, I love you."

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 It's like a bold move for an eighth grader, right?

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 So, there was like a little bit of silence.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And then, she was like, "I love you too."

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And we hung up the phone.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And then, like three weeks later, we broke up.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I mean, I can't blame myself, really.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Like, I think about it.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I mean, even at eighth grade, I was throwing that word around all the time.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I mean, I had no clue what the word meant.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And I was just throwing that love word around for everything.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And I mean, honestly, I still do that today.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I still throw that word around a lot today.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 I mean, just this week, I would talk about my love for baseball, my love for coffee,

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 my love for Blue Bell ice cream, which by the way, the new one,

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 the Cookie Two-Step, this is just time out.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It doesn't relate to the message.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 This is just to bless you.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 The Cookie Two-Step.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream with the cookies and cream together.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I mean, come on.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I will not be offended if you leave right now and go get that, all right?

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Go. Yes.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 It's amazing, and I love it.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 All right, so I love that ice cream.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I love my sons.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I've got two boys.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I've got a seven-year-old and a six-year-old, Jake and Joshua.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I love my wife, Jackie.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I love Jesus.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I love bacon.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I love biscuits.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I love all this stuff.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Okay, so I throw this word around all the time, and you guys do it too.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 You guys do it too.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I mean, your list would be very, very similar to my list.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Maybe a couple names would change on there, hopefully, but your list would be similar.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And so we all go around, and we throw this word around all the time,

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 and I think any reasonable person would know if the word we use to describe our love for bacon

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 or our affections for bacon,

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 if that word is the same word we would use to describe our affections for Jesus

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 or for our spouse, like something's missing there.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Something's missing.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Something's off.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And so tonight, what we're going to do is we're going to talk about love.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 As we continue this Relationship Goals series, we're going to talk about love and what that means.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And here's why this is so important.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 The reason this is so important is because there were so many of you all that walked in here tonight,

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 and you all think you know what love is.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 You think you know what it means to love someone.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And what we're going to see tonight as we open up God's Word,

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 what we're going to see tonight is that we really don't know.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 The understanding we had of love when we walked in here tonight,

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 what we're going to see is it's off.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Or maybe it's not like totally off, but it's at least, what we'll all admit, it's at least clouded.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 It's clouded.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And so what we're going to do specifically is we are going to look at the source of love.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 We're going to look at God's Word.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 We're going to look at the source of love, because Scripture is really clear.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 In fact, in 1 John 4, verse 7, John tells us that love comes from God.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 So God was the originator of love.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 He is the originator of it.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 He is the designer of it.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Man did not come up with love.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Hollywood didn't come up with love.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Television didn't come up with love.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Man, on our best day, on our best day, we would not have come up with love.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 God came up with it.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 He's the designer.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It's His idea.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And so because He's the designer, He's the one that gets to define it.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 He's the source of it, and He's the one that we need to look at tonight.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And He's the one who is going to inform what we mean when we say it.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And so here's what we're going to see.

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 We're going to see that love is a decision.

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 We're going to see that it's accompanied by emotion.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And we're going to see that love always leads to a commitment.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And as we start to get our arms around and really understand what this definition of love is,

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 when we start to get our arms around that,

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 we're going to see that there are some really significant implications,

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 significant implications to our dating relationships and what we mean when we say, "I love you."

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So if you've got your Bibles, let's open up.

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 So there's a lot of different passages we could go to tonight to talk about God's love

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 and get an understanding of God's love.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And I want us to spend some time in the book of Ephesians, chapter 1.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 So that's where we're going to go if you've got your Bibles.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Open up to the book of Ephesians, chapter 1.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And so just a little setup to this.

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 So Paul, the apostle Paul, planted a church in this ancient city of Ephesus.

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And he had since left that church, and then he was writing a letter to that church.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 He had some things that he wanted to communicate with that church.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And in the first century, that's what you did.

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 You wrote a letter to him.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And so Paul, when he wrote his letters, they kind of followed a general formula.

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 He would say, "Hey, this is Paul."

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And then his formula, then after he kind of introduced himself, he would then just praise God.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 At some point in the beginning of the letter, he would just say some sort of praise about God.

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Well, you get this idea, as we're going to see here in Ephesians 1,

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 when Paul was writing this letter to the church in Ephesus,

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 like he had a really, really good cup of coffee that morning, or he was really excited

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 because his praise of Jesus wasn't just a simple statement.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 In fact, it was like the longest run-on sentence in Scripture.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 It's Ephesians 1, verse 3, all the way through verse 14 is one run-on sentence,

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 no punctuation, just Paul fired up about Jesus.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And in this one long run-on sentence all about Christ,

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 what we're going to see as we go through here is we're going to see some aspects of God's love.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 We're going to learn some things about God's love.

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 And so let's jump in.

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Here's where we go, Ephesians 1, verse 3.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Here's what Paul says,

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Christ. And so the very first thing that we see here, as we start to learn,

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 we have this clue about God's love.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And the first thing that we see here is that God's love for you and me,

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 it started as a decision.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 It started as a decision.

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 I mean, he sat up there and he chose, he chose to love us.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 He predestined us for adoption to sonship.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And that idea of predestination, like Paul doesn't put that in there

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 to mess with our theological minds and try to confuse us with that.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 He's saying that he chose us and predestined us.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 That's in there not to confuse us.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 That's in there to comfort us.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 That's in there to like overwhelm us and to wow us and to go,

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 that is amazing that before I was born,

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 before I was born, before I did anything good,

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 before I did anything bad, God and his sovereignty,

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 God and his majesty, God and his grace,

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 and in his mercy in that moment, before I was born,

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 he decided to love us.

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 He decided to do that.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And so the first point that I had tonight about love that we're going to see is that love is a decision.

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Love is a decision.

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Now the culture though, the culture doesn't talk about love as being a decision.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 The culture likes to talk about love as like this force or this power or this storm,

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 this thing that just overtakes you and it overwhelms you.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 It likes to talk about love like we are victims of it.

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 It's just something that happened to us.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 We weren't looking for it.

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 It just overwhelmed us.

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 We fell in love.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Just we woke up one day and we realized we are in love.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 You know, the culture really, it talks about love like it's the flu.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Nobody goes out just being like, you know what?

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 I think I want the flu this week.

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 You know, so I'm going to go out and I'm going to look for the person who's sneezing or whatever,

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 and I'm going to go shake their hand.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 No, nobody goes out looking for the flu.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 It just happens to you.

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 You're just kind of a victim of those germs and you get the flu.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And that's the way that the culture talks about love.

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 We're just victims of it.

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 It just overwhelms us.

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's just this power.

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 It overtakes us.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 And I think like if we're honest, if we're honest, we kind of want it to work that way, don't we?

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 I mean, that's kind of the way we would really like for it to work because for crying out loud,

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 that would make life really, really exciting.

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 If love was just this thing that happened to you.

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I mean, every day you would wake up and you go, I don't know, maybe today is the day.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Maybe today's the day where I'm just going to turn the corner and there she is,

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 or I'm just going to get on the train and boom, there he is.

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 He's right there.

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I mean, this makes waking up to get on an early morning flight to go somewhere for work.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 This makes it a lot better and a lot more exciting because maybe today on that flight,

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 maybe today he sits next to you.

202
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Right?

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And the guy, he sits down and he looks good and he's got his tie on and he brings out a book and sets it on his lap.

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And you're like, that's a John Piper book.

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Right?

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And then he gets his phone and he's texting somebody or it's on GroupMe and you're like, I think that GroupMe is called Community Group.

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Oh, my goodness.

208
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Like today is the day.

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 He's in community and he loves Jesus.

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Like, oh, thank you, Lord, that today love just overtook me.

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Right?

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And you just start planning your wedding.

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 It's just a sailor motif.

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 It's going to be awesome.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Or maybe this makes going to weddings that much more exciting.

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Now that you're the bridesmaid and you shell out all that money for the dress, like that idea of maybe if love is this force,

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 maybe this is finally going to make weddings really exciting to go to because maybe this next wedding,

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 maybe this is the one that when you're up there and it's time to leave and you're paired up with the guy and you got to go back up the aisle,

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 maybe this is the time you're not with the 13 year old brother of the bride.

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Maybe this is the time you're with the roommate of the groom from college who looks good and is a little rebellious.

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Right?

222
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Sleeve tats.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And you're like, yeah, he loves Jesus and he loves the ink.

224
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 All right.

225
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 This is awesome.

226
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I mean, it would be so great if like love, which is it overtook us and it overwhelmed us.

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And I think we want it just to be this force.

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 We want it to be this thing that we are just a victim of.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 That's not what love is.

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 It's not it's not this force.

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Love is a decision.

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 God didn't just like see us one day and just go, oh, wow, look, there they are.

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I'm going to love them.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 It just kind of overtook me.

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Before you were born, before you did anything good, before you did anything bad, God set his affections on you.

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 He decided to love you in the way he loves us is the way we are to love other people.

237
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Love is a decision.

238
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 It is a deliberate act of the will.

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 It is a decision to seek somebody else's best.

240
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 It is a decision to give of yourself.

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 It is a decision that even if you don't feel like loving, you will.

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Love's not a force.

243
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 It's not some power.

244
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 It's not just something that happens to you.

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Love is a decision.

246
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 But there's more.

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Let's keep going.

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So jump back into Ephesians.

249
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 For he chose us before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.

250
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 In love, he predestined us.

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 For adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ.

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And then look at this.

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 In accordance with his pleasure and will.

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 So God, before the beginning of time, before you and I ever existed, before we did anything good, before we did anything bad, God chose, he decided to love us.

255
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And that wasn't merely this data-driven spreadsheet decision.

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 God, when he set his affections on us and when God decided to love us, he did it in accordance with his pleasure.

257
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 There was emotion involved in it.

258
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 He did it according to his pleasure.

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 He did it because he wanted to.

260
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 He did it gladly.

261
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 He gladly set his affections on us.

262
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Look at this.

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Psalm 103.

264
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 The psalmist tells us here that this love that God had for us, it wasn't just this mental decision.

265
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 It also had emotion.

266
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 The Lord.

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Psalm 103, verse 8.

268
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 The Lord is compassionate and gracious.

269
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 He's slow to anger and he's abounding in love.

270
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 That word compassionate there, that's an emotional word.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And so the second point that I have tonight for us is this, is that emotions, they play a role in love.

272
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 But they don't define love.

273
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 So love is a decision, but it's also accompanied by emotion.

274
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 It's a decision, but it's also accompanied by emotion.

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And again, this is not something that the culture really models very well for us.

276
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 The culture largely, largely talks about love like it's just this feeling and it's ruled by feelings.

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 It's led by feelings.

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And as long as the feelings of love are there, then you must be in love.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 And if the feelings ever fade, then that must mean that love is gone.

280
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 The way the culture describes the feelings of love, it's not love.

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 You know what it is?

282
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 It's a crush.

283
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 That's what it is.

284
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And crushes, they are fun.

285
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 They are exciting.

286
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 They are thrilling.

287
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 They are a sweet time in a relationship.

288
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And crushes are out there.

289
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And you don't want to like just plow through that.

290
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 You just got to let that ride its course.

291
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 But hear this, crushes are not love.

292
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 There's a massive difference between love and a crush.

293
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 The feelings of a crush cannot sustain a relationship for a long period of time.

294
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 It just can't.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 You have to, and this is going to sound crazy to some of you guys,

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 you have to let the feelings of a crush fade so that the relationship can progress and grow to become healthy.

297
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And I know that for some of you, you understood all of those words I just said,

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 and I know fully well that some of you are sitting here and you're going, "I don't believe you.

299
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 That's not what I want.

300
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 I don't believe you."

301
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Or some of you, you're sitting next to somebody that you're dating and you're elbowing them right now

302
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 and you're going, "Not us, baby."

303
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 We're different.

304
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 We're always going to have the feels, I promise you.

305
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And I'm telling you, I'm telling you as a friend, I'm telling you, you're wrong.

306
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 You're wrong.

307
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 The feelings have to fade.

308
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Now, now, hear me real clear.

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 That doesn't mean that they fade and then it's just something worse.

310
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 I'm not just sitting up here as like a guy that's been married for 12 and a half years and I'm miserable

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 and I want you all to be miserable, right?

312
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I'm not, that's not the reason I'm saying that.

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I'm saying this.

314
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 I'm saying those things, those feelings are not sustainable.

315
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 They have to fade.

316
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 They have to fade, but they will be replaced by something better.

317
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 They'll be replaced by something better and it's something that you can't even really,

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 it's not even an emotion.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 It's deeper.

320
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 So this love, it's accompanied by this emotion.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 The emotions, they play a role, but they don't define love.

322
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 I remember when I was dating Jackie, so we've been married about 12 and a half years.

323
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I remember when I was dating her, I would leave her, the house that her and her roommate were sharing,

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 I would leave her house and I'd get in my car and I'd have to make a couple turns

325
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 and then I'd get on this one road where I was about a mile away from a highway

326
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 that would take me back to my apartment.

327
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And I remember just about every night there, and there was a season just about every night

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 where I'd get, after we would be on a date, I'd get in my car and I'd make that left-hand turn

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 and I'd be driving that mile down to the highway.

330
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And it felt like, it felt like just going down on a roller coaster for that full mile

331
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 until I got to the highway.

332
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 I mean, it felt like just that free-for-all, that excitement, those emotions were there,

333
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 those feels were there.

334
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I honestly had never, ever, ever experienced a crush like that.

335
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I'd never felt that way before.

336
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And it was so tempting, so tempting, every time I had those feelings,

337
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 to believe that now, because I feel this, that must mean I'm in love.

338
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And now I want to go tell her that I'm in love.

339
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I want to say all these things.

340
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 I want to make all these promises.

341
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 But that wasn't love.

342
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Those were clues.

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Those were clues about some emotions that I was feeling towards her.

344
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 They were clues, but that wasn't love.

345
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 And so what God is reminding us of here is that love is a decision,

346
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 and it is accompanied by emotion.

347
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 It's accompanied by emotion.

348
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It's not ruled by emotion, but it is accompanied by an emotion.

349
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 And for us, too, it's not just an information decision.

350
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It's not just a spreadsheet decision.

351
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 So just because two people on paper look like they'd be a good match

352
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 doesn't necessarily mean they need to be dating or ultimately engaged in getting married.

353
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 So just because on paper it's like, "Hey, she loves Jesus.

354
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 He loves Jesus.

355
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 She's in a community group.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 He's in a community group.

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 They're members.

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 They're both members.

359
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 They read their Word.

360
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 They study all the time.

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 They're sharing their faith with people.

362
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 They're serving.

363
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 They're generous."

364
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 It's like on paper this looks great and it looks like it should be a match,

365
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 but when you get together with that person, there's no joy.

366
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 There's no affection.

367
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 There's no positive feelings with all that.

368
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 That doesn't mean that you should just muscle through that lack of joy there.

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It doesn't mean that that's somebody that you should be marrying.

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Decisions play a role -- or excuse me, emotions play a role,

371
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 but they do not define love.

372
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So love is a decision and it is accompanied by emotion.

373
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And look, because it leads somewhere.

374
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 So look and see where it leads.

375
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 So he chose us.

376
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 He predestined us, and he did this in accordance with his pleasure and his will.

377
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And let's skip down now to verse 13.

378
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 "And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth,

379
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 the gospel of your salvation when you believed.

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 You were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,

381
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those

382
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 who are God's possession to the praise of his glory."

383
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And so Paul, as he's wrapping up this praise here,

384
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 he's reminding us that God decided to love us,

385
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 that that decision was accompanied by emotion, and it led to this commitment.

386
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Like God, when he set his affections on us,

387
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 we were marked in him with a seal.

388
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 We were given the Holy Spirit,

389
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 and that was a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of

390
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 those who are God's possession to the praise of his glory.

391
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 So Paul is telling us that love is this decision.

392
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 It's accompanied by emotion, and it always leads to a commitment.

393
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 When God chose to love us, God wanted to love us.

394
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And when he chose and wanted to love us, that love is unbreakable.

395
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 That love is unconditional.

396
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 There is nothing, nothing, nothing that will ever get in the way of that love.

397
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And so the third point that I have for us tonight is this,

398
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 is that real love, real love is always wrapped in a commitment.

399
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Real love is always wrapped in a commitment.

400
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I mean, I think again, if we just think about the culture,

401
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 the culture, the way it talks about love makes it sound more like it's just a contract.

402
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Like as long as you're keeping up your end of the bargain,

403
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 and she's keeping up her end of the bargain,

404
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 then you guys can continue to love one another.

405
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 But the second one of you doesn't keep up your end of the bargain,

406
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 then you're free to go.

407
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 That's not love. That's a contract.

408
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 That's what that is.

409
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 That's why every time I perform a wedding,

410
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 anytime I do a wedding ceremony, I always remind the couple,

411
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I always remind them that, hey, what you're doing here today is not,

412
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 you guys are not entering into a legally binding contract.

413
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 You're not entering into a contract.

414
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 That's not what's going on here right now.

415
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 What you guys are doing today is you guys are committing your life to one another.

416
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 You guys aren't entering into a contract.

417
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 You guys are entering into a covenant.

418
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 A contract is built on distrust, and that can be broken.

419
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 A covenant, a covenant's built on trust and is completely unbreakable before man and before God.

420
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 What you're entering into is a covenant.

421
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 So true love, true love, like real love, it's always wrapped in a commitment.

422
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And I think this is the deal for all of us.

423
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 That's what we're looking for.

424
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 That's what we want.

425
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 When we're out there and we're like searching for love,

426
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 like that's honestly what our hearts are searching for,

427
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 is we are searching for the love that leads to a commitment.

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And hear me on this.

429
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 The reason why we want that love that leads to a commitment is because that means the love that's being experienced is unconditional.

430
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And that's what we all want.

431
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 We all want unconditional love.

432
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And the reason why we all want unconditional love is because every single one of us in this room tonight,

433
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 we all know we are not a 10.

434
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 We're not a 10.

435
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I mean, we're out there looking for the 10.

436
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 We want the 10.

437
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 We think that's our standard, but we know we ourselves are not a 10.

438
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 We all know that we've got character flaws.

439
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 We've got baggage.

440
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 We've got things that we bring to the table that make us not perfect.

441
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 But here's the deal.

442
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 It scares us.

443
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Because we all know that we're not a 10.

444
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And we are deathly afraid that if we show the true self,

445
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 if we show who we really are to somebody else,

446
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 if they see that we're not a 10,

447
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 then they're going to leave.

448
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And what we want, we want to experience that love that's unconditional,

449
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 regardless of the past behavior,

450
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 regardless of the current behavior,

451
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 regardless of the future behavior,

452
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 that love that will be there.

453
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 That's what we want.

454
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 So when Jackie and I were dating, we'd been dating.

455
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 We'd kind of progressed through the early stages,

456
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 and we're definitely in that crush stage.

457
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And then we had moved on to where it was now more of a seriously dating relationship.

458
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And I started to experience a different emotion.

459
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 There was definitely a lot of the feels were all still there,

460
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 but there was also a lot of fear for me that I was starting to experience in this relationship.

461
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 And that fear was because I knew I wasn't a 10.

462
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I knew that I was a man who had a tremendous amount of baggage.

463
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And as that relationship was progressing,

464
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 and as we were starting to talk about a future,

465
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and we were starting to talk about engagement,

466
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 and maybe talk about getting married one day,

467
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I also knew that I needed to share that baggage with her.

468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I needed to let her know what she was getting into.

469
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 And I was afraid that if I showed her all of that stuff,

470
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 if I told her everything, that she'd leave me.

471
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And my baggage just specifically was this.

472
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I was bringing about $20,000 in student loan debt into that relationship.

473
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 I was studying at that time to be a pastor full-time,

474
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 which I didn't know income levels, if I was going to be able to provide whatever I was going to be able to provide.

475
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 So there was just some worldly fear that was going along with that,

476
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 just believing some lies with that.

477
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And so I was afraid that maybe that was going to turn her off.

478
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I thought that there was a tremendous amount of insecurity that I had,

479
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 just emotional insecurity and relational insecurity that I had.

480
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 But the biggest baggage that I thought I was bringing into the relationship was my sexual past.

481
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 And what I mean by that is this.

482
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 When I was three years old, I was exposed to pornography.

483
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And from age three until age 21, pornography was a consistent part of my life.

484
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And because that was a consistent part of my life for all of those years,

485
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 and especially in those teenage years, I made a lot of decisions that I really regretted.

486
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 That past was a constant source of shame for me.

487
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And so I remember that night where I sat down, and Jackie, she kind of knew the debt situation.

488
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 She knew just some of the relational, emotional insecurities that I had there.

489
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 The conversation that I hadn't had with her yet was what I thought was the deal breaker, was my sexual past.

490
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And so I sat down with her, and I just said, "Hey, I need to share this with you.

491
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 I need to let you know everything."

492
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 And I remember exactly where we were sitting, where I was sitting on the couch, where she was.

493
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And I just put it all out there.

494
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I said, "This is from age three to 21 to now, this is what my struggle is."

495
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 And I thought that was going to be it.

496
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 I thought she was going to say, "We're done."

497
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And that's not at all what she did.

498
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 She looked at me, and she reminded me of God's word.

499
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 She prayed for me.

500
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 She said that doesn't scare her.

501
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 She appreciated the vulnerability.

502
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 She shared some of her past with me.

503
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 This thing that I thought was going to drive us apart didn't drive us apart.

504
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 In fact, it progressed and helped the relationship continue to move.

505
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And I drove home.

506
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 I drove home that day.

507
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I got in my car and drove home that day.

508
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And that stretch of highway that for months had felt like I was going down on this roller coaster with all these fields,

509
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 it didn't feel that way anymore that night.

510
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 That night, the crush ended.

511
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 The crush was over.

512
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And it had been replaced by something that was so much better than just the fields.

513
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 That night, I drove home, and I knew that there was a God in heaven who loved me unconditionally.

514
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And I saw that, and I experienced that in the person of Jackie.

515
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 So love is this decision.

516
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 It is accompanied by emotion, and it always, always, always leads to a commitment.

517
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 That's what it is.

518
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 So here's my challenge.

519
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Here's my challenge for all of us in the room tonight.

520
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 My challenge is this, and it's just, it's real simple.

521
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 My challenge is do not use that word until you are ready to live it out.

522
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Don't use it.

523
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Until you have made the decision that's accompanied by emotion, and you are ready to let that lead to a commitment,

524
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 you're ready to marry someone, you're ready to get engaged to somebody.

525
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Until you are ready to use and actually live out that word, do not use it.

526
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 That's my challenge for all of us in the room tonight.

527
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 And let me unpack that a little bit more and help you understand what that would look like for some different contexts

528
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 that are maybe some different situations going on.

529
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 So some of you in the room tonight are dating people.

530
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Like you're in a relationship right now, and that relationship is not at the point where you're maybe talking about marriage

531
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 or not at that point where you're ready to get engaged, but you're dating.

532
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 You've been dating for a long time, and you're using that word.

533
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 You tell each other, "I love you."

534
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And my encouragement to you is to stop.

535
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Like have that conversation tonight.

536
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Tonight when you leave here, just sit down and go, "Hey, we've been using that word.

537
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 We've been saying 'I love you' to one another.

538
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 We really didn't know what it meant.

539
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Now that we know what it means, and because we're not ready to make this commitment to one another, let's just resolve now.

540
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 We'll use any other word we can think of, but let's just not use that word."

541
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Because really, really what you were probably trying to do was not communicate that you were ready to commit to them.

542
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 If you've started using that word, and you're not engaged or married yet,

543
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 what you're really communicating is, "I just like you a whole lot.

544
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 I like you more than other people.

545
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 I really enjoy being around you."

546
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And so here's what you do.

547
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Just say what you mean.

548
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 "I like you a really, really, really, really, really, really, really lot."

549
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Right? A whole bunch.

550
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Okay?

551
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 So if you come up with any other word, just don't use that one.

552
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Okay? So those of you that are dating, stop using it.

553
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Or, get engaged.

554
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 [Applause]

555
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 There's some girls that are like, "I love him." Right?

556
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 [Laughter]

557
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Man, you are going to have some awkward conversations tonight.

558
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 I love it.

559
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Alright.

560
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 So if you're dating, and you're using it, stop.

561
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 There's another segment in here.

562
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Some of you all are dating, and you know it's about to end.

563
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 [Laughter]

564
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And if that's you, if that's you, and you've used that word,

565
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 here's what you need to do.

566
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 If you're still talking, and you're still trying to figure it out,

567
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 and you've said, "I love you," but you know this relationship is not going well,

568
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 and you know it's heading towards breaking up,

569
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 you need to take it back.

570
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And what it looks like is, "Hey, we said we love each other.

571
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 I told you that. We're breaking up. I'm not making a commitment to you.

572
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 We're now no longer dating right now.

573
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And so I told you that I love you, but I clearly didn't mean it.

574
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And so I want to take that back. Will you forgive me for using it?"

575
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 So when I became a Christian, I was junior year of college,

576
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 and I was dating a girl.

577
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Right around the time that I became a Christian,

578
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 it was an awful relationship, terrible relationship.

579
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And it was not a relationship I should have been in.

580
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 It was not healthy.

581
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And that relationship was heading clearly towards ending.

582
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And we were still in that phase where we were talking,

583
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 but kind of not talking and trying to figure out,

584
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 "Are we going to date anymore? Are we not going to date anymore?"

585
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And I'm starting to learn about the love of God.

586
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 I'm starting to learn more and more about love.

587
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And so we had a conversation one night, and I just told her, I said,

588
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 "Hey, I told you I love you, and I want to take it back because I didn't."

589
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And I don't want you to think,

590
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 I don't know where you're going to go after this conversation.

591
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 I don't know where I'm going to go after this conversation.

592
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 But I don't want you to think that what we had was love, because it wasn't.

593
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And I know that sounds harsh.

594
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 That was the last time I talked to her. Surprise, right?

595
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 I know that sounds harsh, but get this.

596
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 When you throw that word around, that's a weighty word.

597
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 When you throw that word around and you don't mean it, it hurts people.

598
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 And so if you're in that situation where you're moving towards breaking up,

599
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 you need to probably take it back,

600
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 and you need to ask forgiveness for ever saying it in the first place.

601
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 And then there's some of you in the room tonight that aren't dating.

602
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And so for some of you guys that are not dating,

603
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 here's the challenge for you. Resolve tonight.

604
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Resolve tonight that you are not going to use that word

605
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 until you're ready to back it up.

606
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 And here's what I mean.

607
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 When you start dating somebody, that word is off the table.

608
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 It's off the table until you're ready to get engaged and move towards marriage.

609
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 So here's what that looked like for me and Jackie.

610
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 So I had made that decision that, hey, as I started to learn that love is a decision

611
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 accompanied by emotion that leads to commitment.

612
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 I start dating Jackie.

613
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 We're definitely in the DTR stage.

614
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Like we're an item. We're dating.

615
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 We had moved that. We had that first DTR.

616
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 So now it's like, okay, we're a couple.

617
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And I just had a conversation with her one day.

618
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 I just said, hey, there's two things I want to talk about with you.

619
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 One, let's just talk about where the physical boundaries are going to be.

620
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And two, I want to talk about this word love.

621
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 And so here's my belief.

622
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Here's where the line is going to be and where I want us to be.

623
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Physical boundaries and with love. Here's my deal on that.

624
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 I believe love is a decision.

625
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 I believe it's accompanied by emotion,

626
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 and I believe it always leads to a commitment.

627
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And that commitment is best expressed in the covenant of marriage.

628
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 And so we are not going to use that word to describe our affections

629
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 and what we think about one another.

630
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 We're not going to use that word until we're ready to make the commitment.

631
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 And so is that okay? That's just where we're going to be?

632
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 And she said, that's great.

633
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And it just relieved so much pressure because at the end of the night,

634
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 it wasn't like, it's tonight, tonight, the L bomb drops and all that kind of stuff.

635
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 It was just, it just, it was relaxing.

636
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 And then it made, it made that afternoon in July, 2003, really sweet.

637
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Because that, that afternoon we decided that we were going to celebrate our relationship.

638
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 We'd been dating for a long period of time and I was ready to make that commitment to her.

639
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And so our first date was at a coffee shop.

640
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 And so we were going to meet at that coffee shop. That was the plan.

641
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 We were going to meet at that coffee shop at a certain time.

642
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And, and I got some of her friends involved.

643
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 And one of her friends was waiting at that coffee shop.

644
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And Jackie showed up to that coffee shop and she walked in and saw her friend and was like,

645
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Hey, what are you doing here? And she's like, Oh, I'm, I'm here.

646
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 And what are you doing? She's like, well, I'm meeting Adam.

647
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Jackie said, I'm meeting Adam.

648
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And her friend was like, well, Adam's not going to be here.

649
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 He told me that he wasn't going to be here. And he gave me this card.

650
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 And so Jackie's friend gave that card to Jackie and she opened it up and it just said,

651
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Hey, tonight's going to be a lot of fun.

652
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 We're going to celebrate our dating relationship and you're going to pick up a lot of friends along the way.

653
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And so they left that coffee shop and they went to this other spot that was really a special place for Jackie and I.

654
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 We were dating. We went to Chick-fil-A right there on Lover's Lane.

655
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Because we're Christian and that's where we dated. All right.

656
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 So the Lover's Lane Chick-fil-A right up there.

657
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Walk in, Jackie's got her friend. There's another friend. I'm not there.

658
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 She thought I was going to be there. I'm not there.

659
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Other friend has a card. Then, hey, now you're going to go to another spot.

660
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 And then Jackie and I, when we were dating, we did a lot of running together.

661
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 And so there was this one route that we would run and Jackie would run out of breath really early in the run.

662
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 And so that was always the spot right there by that elementary school where she ran out of breath.

663
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 And when she quit talking, I just started praying for our relationship.

664
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 I said, so this is the spot. So she drove to that spot.

665
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 And then there was another friend and another card.

666
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 And then they were now the three of them were all going to this last spot.

667
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And that was the spot where we had one of our first picnics.

668
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 So it was at this park. Her friends show up and drop her off.

669
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 They get out of the car. They hug her. And then it's just her and I.

670
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 No photographers. No videographers for YouTube. Just me and Jackie.

671
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 So we're sitting there and I bring out my Bible and I read some scripture to her and say some things to her.

672
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And then I get down on one knee. And I look her in the eyes and I say, Jackie Lynn, I love you.

673
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 And I get this ring that I had gotten from my grandmother. And I said, will you marry me?

674
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And she said, yes. And we just started making out right there.

675
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Now, she said, yes, we didn't start making out.

676
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Here's the deal. Hear this. So like in the in the Nicholas Sparks movie.

677
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 That was the end. That's the end of the movie.

678
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 That wasn't the end. That moment when I finally told her, I love you, and I backed it up with that commitment.

679
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Hey, now I'm pledging my life to you. We're going to move towards marriage.

680
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 That wasn't the end. That was the beginning. That was the start of our love.

681
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Not the end of it. That was the start of it.

682
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Now I can sit here now and tell you 12 and a half years later that what Jackie and I have right now is it's real.

683
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 It's genuine. It's authentic.

684
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 I mean, if you were to look at the last 12 and a half years of our marriage, you would see a lot of positive emotions.

685
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 You would see a lot of joy. You would see moments of butterflies. You would see moments of laughter.

686
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 You would see moments of just gladness and happiness and a lot of smiling.

687
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 But also after 12 and a half years, you would see also some dark days and some dark weeks that were in there.

688
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 You would see some frustration. You would see some hurt.

689
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 You would see some hurt feelings. You would see a lot of forgiveness.

690
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 It's just it's real. I've seen a lot of the movies. I've seen the movies.

691
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 We've all seen them. I've seen the movies. And I'll tell you what, I can stand up here before you guys and go,

692
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 I've seen the movies and I will take what Jackie and I have every day of the week over those movies.

693
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Because love is a decision. It is accompanied by emotion and it always leads to a commitment.

694
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 We love. We love because God first loved us. This wasn't our idea.

695
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 The way he loved us is the way we are to love one another. It's a decision.

696
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 It's accompanied by emotion. It leads to a commitment. It's not some force that overtakes you.

697
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 It's not ruled by the emotion. And it's not a contract. It's a commitment.

698
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 And so the way he loved us, that is the way we are to love one another.

699
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 Let me pray for us. So God, we thank you for your love.

700
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 God, we just confess that things that we've done in dating relationships are just such a counterfeit version of the real deal.

701
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 God, we just confess there's so many of us in this room tonight that we're just addicted to crushes.

702
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 We're addicted to and just believing the lies that the culture is telling us about love.

703
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 That it's just this thing that overwhelms us. It's ruled by emotion.

704
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 And God, for a lot of us in the room, the way we've loved other doesn't look like a covenant.

705
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Doesn't look like a commitment. It's just a contract.

706
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 So God, we want to repent of that tonight.

707
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 We thank you, God, that you set your affections on us. That love started with the decision.

708
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 We thank you, God, that you didn't just begrudgingly love us.

709
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 That there was affections there. It was emotion there. You wanted to love us.

710
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 And God, most of all, we praise you that the love that you have for us is unconditional.

711
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 There's nothing we can do to separate us from the love that you have for us.

712
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 And so God, we come to you now and we beg, we beg, will you please help us love one another that way?

713
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 Because we know these relationships, God, these marriages that you want us to,

714
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 you want those to be a picture of your son's love for the church.

715
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 So God, we need your help. Help us love that way, please. And we ask this in Jesus name. Amen.

716
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 Thank you, God. That's awesome.

717
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Hey, there's probably room this size. There's definitely some people tonight that,

718
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 honestly, the last thing you probably need to be thinking about is dating and love.

719
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 And there's some of you guys that the first step you need to take tonight is to actually get to know the source of all love.

720
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 Let's get to know who this God of the universe is, get to know who his son Jesus is,

721
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 get to understand, get your mind around this fact that God set his affections on you.

722
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 And he saw that you were stuck in your sins and he saw that you were separated from him

723
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 and he loved you so much that he didn't want you to stay there.

724
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 He loved you so much that he sent his son Jesus to die for you.

725
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 And for some of you in the room tonight, that's what we need to talk about.

726
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 And if that's you, if you don't know who this God is and you don't know about this love that he has for you

727
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 and you don't know about who Jesus is and that he died on the cross for you,

728
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 if you haven't made that decision to trust him and to receive forgiveness of your sins,

729
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 and there'll be some people up here tonight that would be just thrilled to have a conversation with you.
