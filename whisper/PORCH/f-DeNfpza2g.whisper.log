[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   - The book of James is made up of 108 verses.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   54 of them are imperatives.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.500]   An imperative is a command.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.240]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:24.120]   That Jesus was not just his half-brother, he was his Lord.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.360]   - All right, well, hey, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.760]   friends in Houston, Texas, El Paso, Indianapolis,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.400]   Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, Iowa, Boise, Idaho,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.120]   all the 15 different Ports of Live locations
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.380]   and everybody tuning in online.
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.200]   We are continuing this series on the book of James.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.760]   Let me read the passage that we're gonna be in tonight
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.160]   and then I will launch into it
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.520]   and give us some tracks for where we're gonna be.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.760]   This is James chapter two, starting verse 14.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.240]   "What good is it, my brothers and sisters,
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.520]   "if someone claims to have faith
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.340]   "but has no deeds or actions?
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.040]   "Can such faith save them?
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.300]   "Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.140]   "and daily food and one of you says to them,
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.840]   "go in peace, keep warm and well-fed,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.120]   "but does nothing about their physical needs,
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.120]   "what good is that?
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.480]   "In the same way, faith by itself,
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.920]   "if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.460]   "But someone will say, you have faith, I have deeds.
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.020]   "Show me your faith without deeds
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.460]   "and I will show you my faith by my deeds and my actions.
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.460]   "You believe that there is one God, good.
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.060]   "Even the demons believe that and shudder.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.960]   "You foolish person, do you want evidence
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.000]   "that faith without action is useless?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.840]   "Was not our father Abraham considered righteous
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.320]   "for what he did?
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.120]   "When he offered his son Isaac on the altar,
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.160]   "you see that his faith and his actions
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.860]   "were working together.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.160]   "His faith was made complete by what he did.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.480]   "And the scripture was fulfilled that says,
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.540]   "Abraham believed God and it was credited to him
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.440]   "as righteousness.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.540]   "He was called God's friend.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.140]   "You see that a person is considered righteous
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.140]   "or right with God by what they do and not by faith alone.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.840]   "In the same way, was not even Rahab
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.060]   "the prostitute considered righteous
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.020]   "for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.120]   "and sent them off in a different direction?
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.540]   "As the body without the spirit is dead,
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.100]   "so faith without deeds is dead."
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.400]   Let me pray one more time.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.900]   Father, thank you for your word.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.420]   Thank you that you're half-brother James,
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.180]   who lived with you, who knew you,
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.380]   who grew up in the same house with you,
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.100]   who came to faith and believed
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.780]   that you were not just his brother,
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.640]   but you were the savior of the world.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.540]   That you inspired him to write
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.100]   and instruct and give teachings to us.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.260]   And so I pray tonight that the incredible truths
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.820]   of what it looks like and how we can know
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.980]   that we have an actual real faith
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.100]   were preserved and given to us.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.100]   So I pray that you would use this time,
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.420]   you would speak through us.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.360]   I pray for everyone represented at the thousands of stories
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.000]   because there's thousands of people in this room
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.620]   and are listening all over the country right now
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.500]   in different locations,
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.160]   whose names I don't know, but you do.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.640]   Who the number of hairs on their heads, you know.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.560]   You know everything, every anxiety they feel,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.240]   every hope they have for their future,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.200]   every pressure that's weighing them down,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.360]   every sorrow that's weighing their heart,
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.720]   that they would encounter and meet you.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.180]   And they would see that you're not a God who is distant,
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.440]   who's apathetic, but one who loves and runs after
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.980]   and cares and wants you, all of his children
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.960]   to experience life.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.300]   And so would that be believed, understood
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.140]   and received tonight, in Christ's name, amen.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.540]   Well, if you've been coming for any length of time,
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.220]   I, from time to time, will share about a hobby
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.420]   that I have on the side that is called flipping golf carts.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.660]   What's flipping golf carts?
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.820]   It's not where you go up to a golf cart
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.740]   and you try to flip it on its side
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.060]   like cow tipping or something.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.280]   It's where you buy a cheap golf cart off of some resale,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.500]   you know, Facebook marketplace or Craigslist
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.100]   or OfferUp or any of that stuff.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.920]   And I'll try to buy it and then flip it
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.420]   and at least not lose cash
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.740]   because it's one of the best hobbies, especially with kids.
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.260]   'Cause in the meantime, you're fixing it up
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.620]   and trying to trick this thing out
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.900]   and you get to go cruise the neighborhood
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.860]   with kids every night.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.500]   So this is, you know, this is what you do.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.900]   This is what you have to look forward to,
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.380]   the exciting life ahead.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.020]   But this will happen.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.700]   And one of these happened last late November,
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.620]   early December, where I was like,
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.320]   man, we should go look for another golf cart,
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.560]   find one, found a good deal.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.920]   Kind of always have a pulse on that.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.320]   It's a weird thing, but it's true.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   And found a good deal, went and bought it.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.160]   Was so excited.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.520]   We're gonna go look at Christmas lights.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.480]   Lights will be out, kids in the car,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.740]   just, you know, on top of the world kind of feeling.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.940]   Go buy the golf cart.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.200]   Everything checks out.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.120]   Get back home, load everyone up.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.960]   Who's excited?
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.600]   We're gonna go see Christmas lights.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.880]   And it was like one of those, just the top of the mountain.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.320]   This is just the best hot cocoa,
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.800]   four year old and a two year old at that time
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.620]   sitting with me, mom,
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.960]   just cruising around the neighborhood,
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.660]   looking at Christmas lights, Christmas cheer.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.080]   About a mile into,
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.720]   and less than that, maybe three, four, seven mile
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.680]   away from our house, we're riding,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.280]   and the thing completely shuts down.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.120]   There's no go.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.160]   I'm pushing the pedal.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.000]   There's no gas.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.440]   They're electric, so they'd run off of batteries.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.560]   And I realized, man, this thing is not going anywhere.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.760]   And it goes in a moment from like the best of times,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.720]   ha ha, this is amazing, isn't this so great?
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.520]   Take a picture, to, oh my gosh,
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.360]   we're gonna die out here
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.680]   where I'm having to push this thing
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.360]   with three people on it, a mile all the way home,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.640]   going up hills, the lights on it don't work anymore
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.920]   'cause it's not getting power.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.860]   And it went from the best of times to the worst of times
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.040]   where you're just trying to hold it together and stay sane.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.640]   And I'm pushing this thing home.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.920]   And it was not a holly jolly Christmas evening,
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.760]   just to say that.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.800]   So we go home, I get there and I begin to look at like,
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.640]   man, what just happened?
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.920]   Did I just get totally scammed out of this golf cart?
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.240]   I'm looking in and they're pretty simple machines.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.400]   It's going somewhere by the way.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.600]   They run off of six different batteries.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.960]   So I check the batteries, I pull them out.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.240]   I assume one of them is dead.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.200]   Take these volt meters,
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.440]   basically checks the positive negative side,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.100]   go through, check all the different batteries.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.140]   This one checks out, this one checks out,
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.120]   this one checks out, boom, dead battery.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.600]   A golf cart can't run with a dead battery
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.160]   because it'll short out the circuit essentially.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.480]   And what had happened was one of those batteries,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.760]   lo and behold, I was unaware, purchased it,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.120]   and it was totally dead.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.080]   What does that have to do with James chapter two?
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.120]   Well, tonight, in the same way that I took a volt meter
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.440]   and I was able to test and see which of these is dead
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.760]   and a dead battery, the passage we're gonna look at
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.360]   is James's volt meter as it relates to faith.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.600]   Well, he's gonna go through and he's gonna say,
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.520]   hey, here's how you can know you have a living,
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.600]   saving, real faith.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.960]   And here's how you can know you have a dead faith.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.460]   And he's gonna put a volt meter up to our faith,
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.900]   our beliefs.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.880]   Inside of the room, a lot of us would claim
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.360]   and say we're Christians.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.680]   And James would say, if you claim to be a Christian,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.440]   and yet if the volt meter of God's word
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.800]   that we're gonna explore comes up to your life,
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.400]   it's not necessarily what you say that matters,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.680]   it's whether or not you actually have a real faith.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.960]   I'm gonna explain even what I mean by that
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.440]   and what I mean by faith, but James is gonna say,
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.340]   there's a way that you can leave here tonight
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.440]   knowing 100% confident,
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.960]   I have a real, genuine, authentic faith.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.020]   And there's a person who will leave here tonight
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.840]   and they should wrestle with the fact
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.120]   that according to James, I'm not actually a Christian.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.160]   I don't have a faith.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.680]   I don't even actually believe the things
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.240]   that James would say mean I'm a Christian.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.200]   I don't know that there is a more important passage
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.900]   in the book of James that we're gonna study.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.460]   It's a passage that quite literally,
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.000]   James would say, depending on which camp you fall into,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.780]   a dead faith or living faith,
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.400]   answers the question of where you will spend
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.760]   your eternity someday.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.620]   I know in the room there's also people
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.240]   who may just kind of exploring the faith
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.360]   and this is just for you to know,
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.800]   this is a message towards Christians.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.380]   James is gonna say, one of the reasons
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.600]   that if you are exploring faith,
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.560]   you wouldn't even say you're a Christian,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.880]   one of the reasons a lot of times people don't like
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.600]   the church or Christians is because people
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.080]   will claim to be Christians or have a real faith.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.520]   And James would say, they've got a dead faith.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.480]   They don't live their lives like Jesus calls them to
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.940]   or like a person with a genuine real faith would.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.300]   And so you may have written off Christianity
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.260]   and you weren't writing off actual Christianity,
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.980]   you were writing off a poser.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.780]   So tonight we're gonna explore some of the most
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.060]   packed and punching verses that James has.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.660]   It also is one of the most misunderstood passages.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.860]   So we're gonna go slow, address kind of the challenges
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.760]   that's out of the text and explore exactly
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.780]   what James is saying.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.900]   If you're just joining us tonight,
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.620]   we've been going through the book of James.
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.180]   James, as I said earlier,
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.960]   was written by the half brother of Jesus.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.380]   You may not know this, Jesus had siblings.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.880]   They didn't have the same dad 'cause his dad was God,
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.300]   but they grew up in the same home.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.600]   And James was one of them.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.000]   He didn't always believe.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.800]   In fact, for years, he thought his brother was crazy
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.860]   and starting some cult.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.120]   And then his brother died and he came back alive.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.460]   And James spent the rest of his life going everywhere
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.820]   saying, I saw my brother die, buried in the ground.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.340]   And then he came back to life.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.560]   He's the savior and he gave his life to it.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.400]   And he wrote the earliest book of the New Testament.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.220]   In other words, you do a trivia game after this,
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.060]   a torch is not, you're like,
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.160]   "Hey, what's the earliest book of the New Testament?"
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.300]   The book of James.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.040]   He was the head of the church in Jerusalem,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.720]   one of the key leaders that God used
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.800]   to see Christianity explode all over the world.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.320]   And he writes this letter and in it,
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.720]   he's writing to people and he says,
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.120]   "Here's how you can know you have real faith.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.840]   And let me tell you my biggest burden.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.360]   Some of you right now, listening online,
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.040]   listening on the podcast, Future Day,
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.100]   listening at locations, you don't have a real faith.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.440]   And the best thing that you can do is acknowledge that
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.500]   so that you can change that.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.760]   Because you grew up in a Christian home,
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.100]   you went to Catholic school, you went through confirmation,
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.260]   you were an acolyte,
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.680]   but you've never actually had a true conversion,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.080]   had a moment where you actually surrendered
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.560]   your life to Jesus.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.920]   And tonight, James would say, "This is your night.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.580]   And the best thing you can do is stop faking it,
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.240]   hiding it, pretending it, and make the decision.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.720]   I'm gonna actually evaluate, do I have a genuine faith?"
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.360]   So we're gonna look through the passage again.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.400]   We're gonna look at three things.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.460]   What James says is worthless faith,
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.320]   what he says is authentic faith,
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.720]   and then what are the actions of authentic faith?
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.120]   So you can know like, "Oh man, man, that's me.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.960]   I do have a real faith."
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.600]   Or you can know, "That's me, I don't have a real faith."
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.980]   So James chapter two, verse 14, I'm gonna read it again.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.780]   We'll go slow through the text.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.120]   Where he brings up the topic of worthless or dead faith.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.720]   Here's what he says.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.600]   "What good is it, my brothers and sisters,
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.160]   if someone claims to have faith,
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.640]   but they have no actions that flow out of that faith?
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.480]   Can such faith save them?"
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.700]   In other words, hey, if somebody has faith,
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.320]   but it doesn't impact their life,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.920]   is that actually a saving faith?
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.520]   Like, do they have genuine, real faith in God?
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.340]   Suppose, and then he uses an illustration.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.700]   "A brother or sister is without clothes and daily foods."
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.660]   They're shivering, they're cold, and they're hungry,
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.780]   James says, "Imagine with me."
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.260]   And one of you says to them, "Go in peace, keep warm,
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.100]   be blessed, stay well fed."
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.460]   But does nothing about their physical needs.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.700]   What good is it?
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.720]   His point is, if somebody's starving, sitting there,
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.740]   they're freezing to death, and you just tell them,
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.740]   "Hey, be warm, God bless, brother."
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.160]   It does nothing to impact their life.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.880]   He's using that as an illustration.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.600]   In the same way, faith by itself,
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.160]   if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.640]   The first idea from the text is that workless faith
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.440]   is worthless faith.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.200]   And I'm gonna go real slow around the turns,
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.680]   'cause it's really important to understand
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.800]   what James is saying, what he's not saying.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.680]   But he says, "Hey, workless, actionless,
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.280]   a faith that doesn't produce, doesn't change,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.440]   doesn't impact how you live, how you think,
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.600]   how you operate, is a worthless faith."
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.240]   Or he uses another analogy of, "It is a dead faith
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.600]   if it doesn't have works."
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.220]   Now, let me address really quickly
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.360]   the interpretive challenge.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.280]   What's an interpretive challenge?
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.360]   It's when you read the Bible and you're like,
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.400]   "Whoa, that seems a little interesting,"
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.000]   or, "That seems like it contradicts itself."
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.780]   All throughout the New Testament, there's verses,
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.320]   if you've been a Christian or around the Bible for some time,
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.400]   you've heard verses that seem to contradict
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.660]   what he just said, 'cause he just said,
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.120]   "Hey, you think you have faith, but you don't have works,
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.280]   you don't have actions, you're not really saved."
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.240]   James, that feels harsh, bro.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.160]   Doesn't the Bible say you're saved by grace through faith,
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.240]   not by works?
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.080]   Yes, it does.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.760]   Ephesians chapter two, verse seven through 10 says,
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.920]   "It is by grace," grace is giving a free gift,
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.460]   a gift that you don't deserve.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.480]   "It is by receiving an undeserved gift
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.840]   that you can be saved through faith,
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.240]   or believing in Christ and what he did on the cross,
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.560]   rising again."
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.300]   It's not of yourselves, it's the gift of God's,
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.220]   not by works, so that no one can boast.
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.960]   For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus,
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.000]   to do good works, which God prepared in advance
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.960]   for us to do.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.080]   Is James and Paul contradicting each other?
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.920]   No.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.400]   James is not saying that works are a requirement
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.900]   to be a Christian or to be saved.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.120]   James is saying that good works are a by-product
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.380]   of being saved.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.180]   In other words, it's not what gets you
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.480]   into a relationship with God,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.300]   it's what happens to people
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.120]   who get into relationship with God.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.700]   It naturally begins to flow out of them.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.400]   Even Paul's verse in Ephesians chapter two says,
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.120]   "Hey, you've been saved by grace through faith,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.180]   nothing you've done, not because of anything you did."
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.520]   And then he goes immediately into,
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.140]   "You are God's handiwork or masterpiece,
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.180]   created for good works."
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.960]   You get saved and it leads to life change.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.380]   As it's been well said throughout just church history,
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.380]   safe, I'm sorry, faith that saves is never alone.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.800]   We're saved by faith alone, but a faith that saves,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.160]   true faith, is never alone.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.120]   We are saved by believing in Jesus
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.120]   and what he did on the cross, by faith alone.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.800]   But once that happens, that faith or a saving faith
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.160]   never stands alone.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.940]   It begins to impact and change lives.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.280]   And James is saying, "Hey, if you have workless,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.680]   actionless faith, you don't have real faith.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.640]   You have a worthless faith.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.680]   If it doesn't lead and change the way that you date,
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.760]   the way that you spend money, the way you use your time,
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.960]   you should be concerned."
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.840]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.840]   If it's not working or if there's no active impact
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.880]   on how you live your life,
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.360]   you probably don't have a real true living faith.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.720]   You have a dead faith.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.820]   My home, I love security cameras.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.660]   Here's why.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.300]   Really big left turn here.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.140]   So one of my favorite things about living in 2021
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.580]   is that security cameras, you know, 15 years ago,
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.580]   only like Bill Gates had security cameras.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.940]   Now you can go on Amazon for like 25 bucks,
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.740]   your whole home, you can put them everywhere.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.780]   They're wired and it just allows
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.760]   probably the neurotic part of my brain
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.300]   to be able to go like, "Oh, what's going on at home
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.120]   when I'm traveling or doing something on the road?"
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.540]   So we've got them all over the place.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.100]   And recently I was like,
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.500]   "Man, I should put some in the backyard."
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.900]   Or like, I can't believe I'm that guy.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.900]   I just put them in the backyard
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.260]   and maybe in the neighbor's yard too.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.460]   And I was like, "Man, I'm gonna buy outdoor camera.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.740]   It's got a two year battery on it and just put it there.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.820]   And I'll be able to see anybody that comes over there
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.660]   or jumps in the fence
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.940]   and you are not messing with my lady at home or my kids."
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.300]   So that's my mindset.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.260]   I go buy the camera and I get it at home.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260]   I'm setting it all up, go to put it up.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.700]   And I set it and sync it with an app
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.580]   that you have on your phone
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.780]   that allows you to kind of see what's taking place.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.080]   And I realized, "Man, this thing is not working."
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.740]   And so I try to turn it off, turn it back on,
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.740]   sync it back again.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.700]   There's nothing taking place in this security camera.
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.880]   In other words, this thing that I bought
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.740]   that I thought would work and allow me to see
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.600]   and be able to patrol and know what is going on
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.700]   has no life in it.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.020]   I can't see any signs of anything on there.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.220]   And I'm looking through the manual,
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.240]   Googling how to fix this thing.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.260]   And it was a dead, entirely dead camera.
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.700]   It wasn't a camera at all.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.560]   An expensive bunch of plastic.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.060]   Because a camera that can't take footage
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.220]   and doesn't have video and can't look and see and use
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.420]   is worthless.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.540]   And James would say,
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.760]   "If you don't have a faith that impacts how you live,
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.380]   "you have a worthless faith."
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.740]   That any faith that doesn't have works
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.740]   or that doesn't lead you to change
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.740]   or doesn't guide your life is a worthless, worthless faith.
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.140]   How else do you know if you have a dead faith?
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.480]   Well, what are things that are not dead do?
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.320]   They grow.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.980]   Some of you guys, if you live in a house,
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.100]   you went through snowmageddon.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.820]   I guess we all did if you live in Dallas.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.140]   And at snowmageddon, something happened
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.540]   if you have a house or you live in a place
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.500]   where there's plants and different things outside.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.400]   For whatever reason, I have never known
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.620]   that whenever a huge storm comes in,
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.460]   you're supposed to go out
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.380]   and put like blankets on the plants.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.300]   This is so weird to me.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.400]   People are like covering them up,
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.380]   like, "All right, good night, honey."
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.220]   Okay.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.180]   And you're supposed to do this.
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.980]   And I don't ever know which ones to put it on
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.420]   because you don't have like 85 different blankets
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.560]   for all these different bushes.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.060]   And so is it like eenie, meenie, minie, moe
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.260]   or which one is gonna most likely die?
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.600]   And so we just don't do that.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.860]   And we just rolled the dice.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.380]   We rolled the dice at the end of snowmageddon
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.500]   and became very clear.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.200]   Snowmageddon, for those in other locations, was in Dallas.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.600]   It was a month ago and just snow, ice, craziness.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.440]   It was very clear.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.960]   It became very clear afterwards
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.700]   which things were living and which were dead
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.200]   because spring came right behind that.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.740]   And the things that were living
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.820]   all had one thing in common.
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.380]   They grew.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.020]   They began to produce leaves and grow.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.620]   And the things that were dead did not.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.180]   They still are not
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.900]   'cause they're sitting there and they're dead.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.600]   If you have a genuine living faith,
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.860]   it is going to grow.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.660]   And a question you should be asking,
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.740]   if you trusted in Christ,
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.180]   maybe at like age seven at Iwanas
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.700]   or you were raised in Catholic school
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.780]   and you went through confirmation,
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.100]   do you have a faith that when you look back,
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.020]   you see, "I have grown.
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.980]   "I am more spiritually mature today
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.980]   "than I was last year, three years ago, four years ago."
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.720]   Because James would say,
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.300]   "If you don't, you have a dead faith."
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.280]   Living things grow.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.120]   When you look back in your life,
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.080]   can you see a trajectory where things began to change?
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.520]   There's a lot of people in this room,
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.400]   when it comes to faith,
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.540]   you're right in line with what James says.
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.300]   And again, I'm talking to people
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.620]   who would say I'm a Christian.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.780]   If you're here and you're exploring,
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.420]   man, you just get to look on and be like,
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.820]   "I can't believe you guys."
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.940]   These are people that would claim to be a Christian.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.820]   And they have what James says.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.980]   A lot of times people who claim to be Christians,
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.380]   but aren't Christians do, they got lip service.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.580]   Real true faith is not lip service.
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.980]   It is a lifestyle.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.780]   It impacts how you live.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.020]   The guy said, you can say a bunch of words.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.280]   I mean, the analogy he gives is
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   the guy who is not genuine in his faith says,
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.280]   "Oh, stay warm, stay well fed, God be with you."
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.420]   That he has lip service,
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.220]   he just doesn't have a lifestyle that goes along with it.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.340]   And if you don't have a lifestyle
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.060]   that goes along with your faith,
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.300]   and it's just, man, I am a Christian, I claim to be that.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.060]   Yeah, I'm cool with God.
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.200]   You don't have a real faith.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.660]   This is so huge in dating.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.460]   Let me just say this really quick.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.460]   There are people in this room, guys and girls,
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.780]   who would claim to be a Christian.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.780]   They got a Bible, they go to the porch,
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.360]   they got Jeremiah 29 11 in their Instagram bio right now.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.800]   And they are not Christians, biblically.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.160]   Because if you ask them and you explain like,
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.080]   hey, what's the gospel?
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.200]   Or what does it mean to be a Christian?
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   They'd be like, well, I try to be a good person.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.400]   And I try to live my life in a good way.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.480]   And I go to church and pay my taxes.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.560]   That's not what it means to be a Christian.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.580]   It's not somebody who was raised in Catholic school
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.400]   and they went through mass or went through confirmation
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.480]   and they were all in and it was important.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.600]   It's someone who has a moment in time
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.500]   where they believe Jesus is the son of God.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.860]   And not just that he's the son of God,
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.420]   but he came and he died on a cross for them.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.820]   For every sin, every abortion represented here,
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.420]   every look of pornography represented here,
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.440]   of all the sexual sin represented here,
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.940]   all of it on the cross nailed.
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.780]   He died, he paid for it and he rose again.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.620]   And anyone who says,
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.020]   I accept Jesus paid for my sin on the cross
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.100]   and he rose from the death or rose from dead
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.040]   to prove that payment was more than enough.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.880]   And I believe it.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.920]   And I'll have eternity with God, not 'cause I deserve it,
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.280]   but because he paid for it.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.080]   That person is a Christian.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.280]   Someone who says, man, you know, I'm cool with God
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.160]   and I like church.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.400]   Even if they say they are,
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.280]   you can say you're a Christian, that doesn't mean you are.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.320]   I can say I'm a hippo.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.680]   It doesn't mean I'm a hippo.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.460]   And James says, it's not lip service.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.240]   It is a lifestyle.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.520]   The gap between someone,
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.520]   and we'll move off the dating thing,
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.580]   but the gap between someone who is a porch attendee
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:42.580]   or a church attendee and a Christ follower is enormous.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.260]   And you need to make sure
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.580]   that when it comes to who you're evaluating,
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.860]   who you're considering dating,
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.740]   you are not dating just somebody who is attending the porch
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.380]   or attending church, but someone who is following Christ.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.080]   'Cause that is a chasm or a grand canyon
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.300]   in between the two of them.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.700]   And right in the middle, what's in that gap?
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.460]   Obedience to Jesus.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.160]   They don't just put lip service out,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.240]   it impacts their life and how they live.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.760]   I know in this room, I mean, we live in Dallas,
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.660]   we live in the Bible Belt.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.760]   You ask the average person, hey, what's your faith?
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.680]   They're gonna say I'm a Christian.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.240]   And by that, they mean I'm not an atheist,
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.860]   I'm not a Hindu, and you know, as raised,
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.520]   we went to Easter and Christmas together growing up.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.920]   And they're not a Christian.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.760]   This past weekend, we went with my wife's family,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.160]   we went to a lake house up in Oklahoma.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.060]   And while we were there,
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.920]   they had this extra large checkers board.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.800]   And I sat down, my five year old was like,
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.640]   oh, I wanna play checkers, I've never played checkers before.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.540]   And I sat down and I'm looking at this extra large
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.720]   kind of checkers board.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.140]   And I was like, oh man, I loved checkers as a kid,
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.360]   played it all the time.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.520]   And I began to realize,
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.640]   I can't remember how to play checkers.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.760]   I know it's a very simple game
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.800]   where you kind of hop over different things,
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.480]   but can you go forward and back?
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.520]   No, you can't go, or is it diagonal?
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.640]   Are we both on the same like checkers?
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.500]   Or what, and I had to look up the rules
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.580]   because it's been years.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.980]   I can remember how to play chess,
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.060]   I can't remember how to play checkers.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.120]   It's something that was so a part of my childhood,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.420]   but at some point you kind of walk away from that
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.640]   and it's no longer a part of your active life
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.700]   or part of your life.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:17.620]   That is what so many people's faith is like.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.700]   It's a thing that like, oh yeah,
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.000]   and I totally remember it and Jesus,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.500]   and there was Jonah and there was a whale
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.340]   and there was God and there's some cool stuff in there.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.240]   And you know, he died for us.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.180]   And I went to church and I was raised around it and VBS.
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.960]   But it's just something from your past.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.120]   It's not a part of your active present.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.240]   And James would say, man, God's not angry at you.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.620]   He loves you, he loves you so much.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.080]   He has you here on a Tuesday night to know
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.360]   that if it's not a part of your lifestyle,
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.020]   it's not an active living real faith.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.340]   He continues.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And he goes into how you and I can see
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.720]   what authentic faith looks like.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.360]   But someone will say, so he brings up
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.400]   in theoretical hypothetical person,
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.420]   you have faith, I have deeds,
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.540]   as though you could separate those.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.600]   Show me your faith without deeds
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.000]   and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.940]   You believe that there is one God, good.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.360]   Even the demons believe that and they are not saved.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.920]   They shudder.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.700]   James says, hey, the way that you can see,
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.380]   show me your faith without deeds is like saying,
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.680]   show me how fast you are without running.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.360]   Show me how strong you are without lifting a weight.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.680]   Show me how intelligent you are without taking a test.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.920]   It's not possible to do.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.080]   That these two things are interrelated.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.700]   That a person who has genuine faith,
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.720]   I believe 'cause the word faith means trust.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.600]   A person who genuinely trusts God
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.160]   has that play out in their life and impact how they live,
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.920]   how they spend their time, who they are.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.620]   He says, there is a belief and how terrifying is this?
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:58.860]   There is a belief that doesn't save you.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:06.200]   It makes you in the same grouping as the demons themselves.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.180]   It's not a saving belief 'cause it doesn't lead
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.000]   to a changing and impacting.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.120]   It's a belief in or a belief about,
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.880]   but not an actually believe and a trust.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   He brings up demons, which is quite the left turn.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.560]   But when you think about it, he's saying,
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.620]   hey, the demonic realm, demons that are out there,
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.780]   they believe about God.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.720]   They have a better theology probably than every person,
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.760]   including myself on the stage up here.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.120]   Over and over, if you read the New Testament,
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.180]   you read the gospels, which is the stories of Jesus' life,
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.380]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.680]   Jesus will walk around and he'll interact with them people
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.920]   and he'll show up inside of a village
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.040]   and somebody who will be demon possessed will pop out
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.780]   and be like, say things that are staggering.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.120]   They know very well who Jesus is.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.560]   They know better than the disciples.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.680]   The 12 guys fall on him like, oh, we're not exactly sure.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.560]   And the demons will pop out and they'll say,
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.760]   we know who you are, the Holy One of God.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.360]   Have you come to destroy us?
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.400]   Here's one example, Mark 1:23,
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.440]   an impure spirit, Jesus walking through town,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.040]   pops out and said, what do you want with us,
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.920]   Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.440]   Have you come to destroy us?
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.800]   I know who you are, the Holy One of God.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.400]   They know exactly who he is and they're not saved.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.720]   They shudder in fear at him.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.220]   And James says, a belief about God,
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:28.720]   a belief in God is different than believing God.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.960]   Let me explain, 'cause that's a really,
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.040]   really important adjective
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.000]   or really, really important preposition.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.080]   Believing in is different than I believe you.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.900]   Someone could say, oh yeah, I believe in God.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.320]   Like, I believe in higher power.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.080]   I believe in, you know, old man upstairs.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.040]   I believe in God up there of some sort.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:53.100]   That is different than I believe God is who he says he is.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.720]   And I believe him when he says, you should date this way
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.160]   and save sex for marriage.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.640]   I actually take him at that word and I trust him.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.180]   I'm actually gonna act in light of that.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.480]   I believe that when he says, hey,
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.640]   you're not just here to get a paycheck
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.480]   and live your whole life,
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.200]   storing up as much cash as you can
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.800]   and living as though you're gonna live forever
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.460]   in this world, you're to live and take all the resources,
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.840]   all the money, all the opportunities,
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.860]   all the time that you got and use them
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.380]   as though you're gonna spend forever in eternity with God.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.600]   And anything you give towards his kingdom,
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.040]   you're gonna have a hundredfold given back to you
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.220]   in the life to come, which will be far longer than this one.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.880]   He says that type of person,
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.100]   the person who doesn't believe in,
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.740]   like, oh, I think they exist up there,
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.740]   but I believe him is a saving faith.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.180]   Demons, they believe in, they know he's there.
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.120]   They're terrified of him.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.620]   They know he's powerful.
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.960]   They believe about him.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.420]   They don't know him.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.840]   And he would say, the way that you can know that
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.700]   is that authentic faith is an acting faith.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.860]   It doesn't just believe about, it believes and acts.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:58.860]   A behavior follows from that belief about God.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.500]   Another way of saying it is,
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.940]   you can believe God is real,
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.860]   or you can believe God is Lord.
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.300]   The person who believes that God is real
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.620]   is somebody who would say,
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.340]   oh, I think there's a higher power,
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.520]   but that's different than somebody who says,
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.500]   God, you're my Lord.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.500]   When you say, "Goes," I'm gonna live my life for you.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.260]   You're my Lord, you're my Savior.
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.780]   When you say, "I'm gonna seek to obey,"
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.620]   the person who says that God is real,
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.220]   they attend church, they show up at the porch sometimes,
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.660]   they go to church on Christmas and Easter,
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.000]   'cause it's just what you do.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.720]   The person who believes God is Lord,
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:34.000]   not just God is there, they get plugged in,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.060]   they dive in and do what Hebrews 10, 24 says,
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.900]   which is that you and I are to continue to gather
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.820]   in small groups and encourage one another
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.060]   and have these deep, real, authentic relationships
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.100]   with other Christians who come alongside
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.900]   and they encourage me when I'm struggling,
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.700]   and I encourage them when I'm struggling,
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.220]   and we both read the Bible together
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.620]   and we walk alongside of each other,
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.320]   that person believes he's Lord, not real.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.980]   The person who believes he's real is like,
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.180]   yeah, dude, sex before marriage,
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.840]   you know, I'm not just throwing myself out
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.380]   like I'm a crazy prostitute, but we love each other
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.700]   and we're probably married in God's eyes and His ways,
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.780]   and we're gonna get married someday,
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.060]   and so it's not that big of a deal.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.420]   If that person believes God's real,
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.380]   but he's not their Lord,
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.500]   the person who believes he's Lord says,
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.340]   yeah, of course I'd love to sleep with my boyfriend,
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.220]   of course I'd love to sleep with my girlfriend,
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.140]   but according to the Bible,
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.100]   sex is something that God gave us this incredible gift
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.340]   that takes place in the context of marriage,
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.460]   and so even though I don't feel like it,
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.620]   even though I don't want to,
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.900]   even though I'd love to sleep with her,
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.460]   that's not what we're gonna do.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:34.580]   And there's a huge difference, James would say,
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:39.540]   to the person who believes in God and believes God.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:44.500]   I read, I can't believe I'm using this illustration,
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.460]   but it was a fun book.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.700]   I read, it was a book Matthew McConaughey wrote,
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.860]   and I can't remember the name of it.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.300]   Oh, Greenlights or something?
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.700]   Greenlights?
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.060]   So I was all, hey, stop judging me, people.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.780]   Good grief, I'm not endorsing it either.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.400]   I'm not, I know a guy who read this book
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.540]   by Matthew McConaughey, and I'm praying for him,
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.380]   and we were on vacation, people.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.880]   I just wanted a fun, anyways, read the book,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.260]   and in there, it's like basically his autobiography,
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.700]   and he goes through kind of his journey in life,
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.340]   and it's not at all a spiritually deep book
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.100]   or even something I'm recommending,
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.820]   but point being, I got to walk through it,
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.300]   and like, oh, this is where his parents were,
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.540]   this is where he was raised, this is where he lived,
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.380]   he grew up, he went to school,
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.340]   this is kind of what he was like.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.500]   Here's how he even got into that,
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.140]   like, all right, all right, all right moment.
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.400]   Here's all of Matthew's story.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.080]   Now, if I ran into you in a lobby,
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.520]   and I began telling you, and you didn't know
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.240]   that I'd read the book, but you just knew,
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.720]   I just got in a conversation, I was like,
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.600]   oh man, have I told you about my friend Matthew?
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.440]   And he is from East Texas, great guy,
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.840]   Matthew McConaughey, probably heard of him.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.240]   He lives in Austin now, real big UT fan,
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.720]   which I've got mixed feelings about,
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.040]   and he, and I walked through, and I just was like,
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.280]   oh, and he's so great, and his kids,
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.440]   have you seen his, I love, his kids, they're the best.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.600]   I love being around his kids.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.340]   And you said, do you know Matthew?
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.300]   And I was like, yeah, of course I know,
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.140]   and then I'm like, how do you know Matthew?
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.900]   I was like, well, I read his book.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.900]   You'd say, you are like borderline stalkerish right now.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.260]   You don't know Matthew, you know about Matthew.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.620]   There's a difference between knowing someone
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:20.780]   and knowing about them.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.980]   A lot of us, when it comes to God,
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.420]   you know about him, you don't know him.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.620]   And you could say some things,
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.340]   and you've got different nuggets
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.380]   you've picked up along the way,
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.080]   but you don't actually have a relationship with him
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.560]   any more than I have one with Matthew McConaughey.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.120]   And James would say, God, isn't that angry?
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.080]   And you could change that.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.480]   In fact, God wants you to change that.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.440]   He wants a relationship with you.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.620]   He wants you to experience that,
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.560]   and that involves you trusting in Christ
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.880]   and not believing in God, but believing God
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.400]   and walking with him and acting out
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.840]   according to your faith that you claim to have.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.040]   And then he finishes and he gives us
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.440]   the actions of authentic faith.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.640]   So he walks through and he covers
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.980]   how you and I can know what it looks like
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.240]   to have authentic faith, which is that it always acts.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.600]   And then he finally gives the actions
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.200]   that authentic faith has.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.600]   So how you can know right now,
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.120]   do you actually have authentic faith?
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.720]   And he gives two illustrations from the Old Testament.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.900]   One is patriarch, which is just like a father Abraham,
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.020]   and then one is a prostitute.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.920]   Quite the gap, but he's going somewhere
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.160]   and he proves this point by saying,
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.000]   hey, look at the actions that they had,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.620]   this real faith that was associated.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.160]   You foolish person, do you want evidence
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.200]   that faith without action or deeds is useless?
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:43.200]   Was not our father Abraham considered righteous
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.200]   for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.640]   You see that his faith and his actions were working together,
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.180]   doing what true faith always does,
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.080]   which is they work together in tandem.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.860]   And his faith was made complete by what he did.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.720]   And the scripture was fulfilled that says,
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.860]   Abraham believed God, not believed in God,
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.600]   he believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.400]   And he was called God's friend.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.520]   He did what friends do, good friends anyways,
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.340]   and that they're willing to act out of that friendship.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.640]   They're willing to come pick you up,
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.000]   they respond when you need a ride to the airport,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.540]   when you're moving somewhere, they act on that.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.780]   And he did what real friends
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.820]   or what a friend of God would do,
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.500]   which is he acted in light with his belief.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:37.460]   You see that a person is considered righteous
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.460]   by what they do and not by faith alone.
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.000]   The same you may have justified or counted as righteous.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.260]   He's saying you can see a person has genuine faith,
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.820]   not just by what they claim, but why, by how they act.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.200]   That's what he says.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.120]   In the same way was not even Rahab,
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.780]   the prostitute considered righteous for what she did
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.480]   when she gave lodging to the spies
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.540]   and sent them off in a different direction.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.120]   As the body without the spirit is dead,
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.080]   so faith without deeds is dead.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.240]   He goes into two illustrations.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.520]   First one, Father Abraham, what's he talking about?
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.960]   Father Abraham was the guy God comes to,
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.480]   Genesis chapter 15, Genesis, first book of the Bible,
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.020]   all the beginnings of how this whole thing started.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.880]   God shows up to a guy named Abraham,
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.400]   Abe is sitting there, God says,
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.040]   "Hey, I'm gonna make you a father of many nations.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.380]   "Look up at the sky, see all the stars that are out there,
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.580]   "as many stars as you could see out there beyond that,
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.840]   "so shall your descendants be."
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.480]   And he looks up, sky's full of them,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.480]   not like Dallas stars,
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.980]   but like out East Texas country stars everywhere.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.120]   That's how many kids you're gonna have.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.020]   Abraham goes 75 years, God shows up again and says,
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.060]   "Hey, I'm gonna make you a father of many nations.
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.600]   "You're gonna have kids after kids."
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.660]   He's like, "Hey, that's great God, problem is I'm 75,
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.640]   "my wife is 65, not sure any babies coming out of that,
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.240]   "and I don't know what you're planning on doing,
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.440]   "'cause I'm not gonna have any kids
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.080]   "and I'm gonna die without any kids, you promised."
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.960]   God's like, "Got you, it's gonna happen."
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.240]   20 years go by, God shows up again,
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.640]   says, "Hey, this time next year, you're gonna have a kid."
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.480]   By this time, he's 199 years old,
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.480]   and it says his body is as good as dead.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.640]   And his wife is 90,
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.520]   I don't know if you've seen any 90 year olds recently,
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.100]   but not exactly the typical prenatal group
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.120]   that you're gonna see at the hospital.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:31.380]   But God shows up, he has a child, Isaac.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.940]   We waited a century for a baby boy.
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.860]   How spoiled was that kid?
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.900]   We waited a century for you.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:42.000]   Loves him, cares for him, God's promise came through.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.780]   Then one day God shows up and he says,
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.560]   "Abraham, yeah, I want you to do something for me.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.740]   "I want you to take your son, your one and only son,
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.960]   "whom you love, and I want you to take him
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.280]   "to the place I will show you.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.080]   "And I want you to sacrifice him there on an altar to me.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.920]   "I want you to put him to death."
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.960]   I mean, how staggering is that if you're Abraham?
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.880]   Like, this is the child we've been waiting,
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.480]   this is the one that you promised, it was through him.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.680]   And you didn't say any child, you said through this child,
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.880]   you're gonna bless all of the world,
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.400]   the Savior will come through this one child.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.480]   How can you be asking me to do that?
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.720]   And it says that Abraham believed that
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.780]   if God even had to raise him back from the dead, he would.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:32.880]   And he trusted God with his most prized possession.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.060]   And he takes his son, his son's a young boy,
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.180]   doesn't know what's going on.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.900]   Says, "Isaac, we're gonna go worship the Lord.
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.560]   "I need you to carry this wood."
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.740]   And he has his son carry the wood for his own death,
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.660]   all of which foreshadowing Jesus,
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.560]   who unlike Isaac, who would not be killed,
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.320]   was killed, the son of the father,
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.920]   who carried his own cross like Isaac carried the wood.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.520]   But Isaac's walking along with his dad, walking out there,
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.880]   and they get to this place called Mount Moriah.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.560]   And they have this servant with him,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.720]   and Abraham says, "Hey, so you stay here,
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.920]   "me and Isaac are gonna go up the mountain,
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.360]   "and we will both come back."
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.660]   But he knew no matter what happened, God had promised,
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.860]   I don't know what's about to go down,
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.700]   but even if my son's life is taken,
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.380]   he will be brought back to life.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.820]   And they're walking up and Isaac says,
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.420]   "Dad, you know, we've worshiped tons of times,
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.120]   "we've done this, but we got wood,
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.540]   "we don't have like a lamb or anything to kill."
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.900]   What was that moment like as a dad?
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.060]   And he takes his son, and they build an altar,
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.180]   and he lays him down,
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.320]   and he raises up and he's about to kill his son.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.680]   And out of nowhere, God says, "Don't kill your son!"
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.000]   And he raises his eyes and he sees out in the thicket,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.400]   there had been a ram that had been caught there.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.640]   God provided a sacrifice.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.760]   The reason he didn't have to kill his son
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.080]   is God knew he was about to,
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.240]   he would 2,000 years later kill his.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   But Abraham believed and trusted God,
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   and acted even on the most prized,
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.640]   precious possession that he had.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.480]   I trust you.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.840]   It led him to act, even when it cost him.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.920]   Rahab, what happened to Rahab?
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.880]   Rahab was a prostitute, not exactly the dream job
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.680]   that every girl grows up wanting to have.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.240]   She lived in the city of Jericho,
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.820]   also not exactly the dream city or place
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.000]   to live in that time.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.360]   Pagan city, nation of Israel, free from Egypt, shows up.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.560]   God says, "Hey, you're gonna go in,
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.360]   "and you're going to take the promised land."
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.720]   Says that to the nation of Israel,
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.560]   Moses, Joshua, all these guys, if you remember.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.460]   Joshua goes and he's like,
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.440]   "Hey, we need to spout out the city of Jericho.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.160]   "So two spies, you guys go in there."
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.500]   The two spies go inside,
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.240]   and they get into the city of Jericho.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.200]   And the king of Jericho finds out two spies
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.480]   from that foreign group, the Israelites,
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   who God had basically destroyed the Egyptians through.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.560]   Two of the spies are here.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.880]   They're probably gonna attack us.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.760]   And he's told they went into Rahab's house.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.240]   Now, a lot of people go into Rahab's house
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.040]   because Rahab was a prostitute.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.760]   So king sends word and says, "Rahab,
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.640]   "hey, where are those two guys that showed up?
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.560]   "We know that they went in here."
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.760]   And she was like, "They were here,
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.000]   "but they left and they kind of went out,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.860]   "and they're not here anymore."
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.540]   And she hid the two spies.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.380]   She hid them on the roof.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.520]   And she goes up to the two spies after everyone leaves,
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.800]   or after the king's men leave,
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.760]   and she goes, "Hey, we know what you did.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.600]   "Word about what God has done for the nation of Israel
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.740]   "has spread everywhere, and fear fills this city right now.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.360]   "We know God is gonna take it back.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.180]   "And I know that this land is your land,
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.360]   "and God is going to give us into your hands.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.680]   "And I'm asking you one thing.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.960]   "I hid you, and I risked my own life.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.420]   "Will you repay that by whenever you attack the city,
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.040]   "not killing me and my family?"
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.060]   And they said, "A life for a life.
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.920]   "Just put a red scarlet rope right outside of your window."
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.440]   She puts it outside the window, and she risked her life
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.840]   in order to save these two men,
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.960]   even though it would have cost her,
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.900]   even though it could have cost her her own life
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.560]   if the king had found out she had hidden them.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.860]   Why does he bring in these two examples?
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.320]   Because they both point to what authentic faith does.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.720]   The actions of authentic faith
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.400]   is that it trusts God.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.400]   It acts out of a response to that faith,
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.240]   even if it costs them, even when it's uncomfortable.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.960]   Here's how you can know if you have authentic faith,
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.240]   if you have genuine, real faith,
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.760]   is that it is willing to act even when it is uncomfortable,
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.200]   when it costs you, when it costs you at work,
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.960]   when it costs you in a dating relationship,
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.280]   when it costs you financially,
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.800]   when it costs you your reputation,
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.880]   when it costs you, period, when it's uncomfortable, period.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.120]   When it comes at something that makes no sense
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.960]   for you to act that way, for you to date that way,
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.720]   for you to talk that way, for you to give that way,
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.440]   for you to live that way, unless there's a God who's real,
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.360]   and then it makes all the sense of the world.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.080]   The way that Abraham and Rahab displayed authentic faith
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.840]   is even if it costs me my life and my son,
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.400]   I believe you, God, I trust you, I'm gonna act.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.120]   And the way that you can personally know,
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.260]   I'm not saying you personally have,
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.700]   I'm saying you can personally know,
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.640]   do I have authentic faith, is when you look at your life,
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.920]   do you act in a way that you could go,
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.240]   man, this comes at nothing but cost to me.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.560]   Dating the way that God's word says,
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.240]   where I actually honor girls and I don't just ghost them,
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.820]   I don't just peace out, and I actually am a kind person,
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.400]   I try to leave them better than I found them,
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.120]   I honor their purity and sexually,
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.240]   and I'm considerate of that person,
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.680]   that's not how any of the world dates,
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.720]   that's not how anybody will tell you to date,
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.020]   that's how God says to date.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.760]   That comes at all costs to you, unless the Bible is true,
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.240]   and it actually is the better way to live,
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.600]   and it actually is something that God sees
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.600]   every action that you take and rewards it.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.560]   Then it makes all the sense of the world.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.840]   But you can know right now, hey, I act out of my faith,
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.940]   even with it costs me.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.040]   I could do other things that are kind of shady at work
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.640]   and everybody else in the business does them,
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.040]   but I'm not gonna do those things because I believe God,
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:56.640]   and I'm gonna walk in my integrity as the Proverbs say,
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.600]   even if it costs me.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.800]   I'm gonna spend time every single day
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   studying God's word, waking up early,
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.120]   even though the world around me is like, that is crazy,
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.600]   and it is crazy if there is no God and the Bible's not true,
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.360]   but if it is, it's the most rational,
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.200]   sane thing in the world.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.100]   It's giving sacrificially.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.040]   I know you guys feel like nobody has any cash
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.080]   in the world in here,
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.600]   but it's taking whatever you have and saying,
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.400]   God, everything I have is yours.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.440]   How would you have me use this in giving to churches,
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.080]   giving to Christian ministries, giving to people in need
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.840]   out of a response to your faith?
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.780]   The authentic faith leads to actions.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.120]   What are those actions of authentic faith, the third idea?
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.080]   It's that they choose to trust God and follow Him,
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.240]   even when it costs Him.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.700]   That I'm gonna choose not to intellectually just say,
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.780]   I know God, I'm gonna act on what God has said,
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.200]   even if it costs me.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.200]   A lot of you in the room,
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.800]   it's an old school illustration I heard when I was younger,
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.160]   and it was about having a chair.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.720]   And it was basically pointing out that, man,
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.580]   it's one thing to say, I believe that chair can hold me.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.360]   I believe if somebody sat in that chair,
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.360]   I think they're gonna be okay.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.200]   It's made out of metal, what is this, Ikea?
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.040]   What are we doing here?
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.640]   And it's got solid plastic,
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.080]   it looks like it probably could hold me.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.760]   And I believe that could hold you.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.280]   I believe that chair can hold somebody up there,
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.840]   probably up to 300 pounds-ish, maybe a little shy of that,
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.600]   but it's pretty sturdy looking, it could hold somebody.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.760]   And if somebody said, what do you sit in the chair?
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.280]   I said, well, I don't have to sit in the chair,
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.740]   I believe it, it can hold me.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.440]   Why don't you sit in the chair?
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.860]   What are you, legalist?
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.400]   I told you I believe that the chair can hold me up,
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.440]   and that should be good enough for you to know.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.200]   It's a whole different thing to say, man,
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.760]   I believe the chair can hold me,
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.280]   and to actually be willing to say, man,
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.480]   I'm gonna sit in the chair,
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.060]   'cause I can trust it.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.560]   And true faith is one that says, man,
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.920]   even if everybody else in the world is not willing
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.680]   to act this way, or do what God says,
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.280]   or it seems so old-fashioned, or nobody's doing it,
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.200]   I actually believe it,
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.100]   which means I'm actually acting on it.
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:12.480]   And James says, that's 'cause you have real faith,
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.260]   true faith, Abraham Rahab faith.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:21.260]   My son, I'm about to close.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:26.100]   When kids are young, you go swim in the pool,
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.740]   and this year has been like the year of the hotel for us.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.300]   I feel like we've gone to more hotels,
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:33.140]   and they're all like La Quinta, so that's how we ball.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.620]   And we'll be there, and we don't have a pool,
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.100]   but they have pools, so we'll go down to the pool,
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:42.060]   and I'll bring my kids, and every now and then,
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.580]   they'll get too scared to jump off the side of the ledge,
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.220]   and then sometimes, they just can't get enough of it,
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.940]   and they wanna jump off the side of the ledge.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.820]   But I can tell whether or not they trust
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.020]   when they're jumping off the side of the ledge
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.060]   to me to catch them,
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.340]   whether they believe, man, I got you, I'm gonna catch you,
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.220]   I'm not gonna let you fall in, I got you.
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.100]   And they'll sit there,
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.060]   and especially my two-year-old daughter named Monroe,
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.300]   who would stutter step, I'm like,
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.180]   man, I think he'll got me, I'm not really sure,
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.340]   and I feel like I've seen him drop some things before,
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:10.940]   and she'll sit there, and I know when she trusts me,
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.700]   because what does she do?
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.540]   She jumps.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.220]   Until she does that,
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.820]   she's not trusting her father will catch her,
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:18.800]   or she's not trusting her father,
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.500]   she's trusting her footing on the side of the pool.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:25.780]   The way you can see authentic faith is that it acts,
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.300]   and the actions that it takes
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.240]   is that it trusts the Heavenly Father.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.500]   When no one else, when the world around you thinks,
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.720]   oh, that's crazy, nobody lives like that.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:41.740]   I live like that, 'cause God says to live like that,
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:45.180]   and I believe that, and I get nothing in return,
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.940]   you know what, God's not gonna love me any less
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.480]   or love me anymore just because I date the way he says,
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.320]   I live the way he says.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.340]   It's not why I live that way,
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:57.320]   I live that way 'cause I believe God,
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.360]   when he says, when you live according to my word,
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.440]   the Bible, it leads to life,
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:06.880]   and when you don't, it leads to pain, regret, shame,
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.540]   heartache, and I believe him.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:11.880]   Even if nobody else is gonna sit in the chair,
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.000]   I'm gonna sit in the chair,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.960]   and I'm gonna trust my father,
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.940]   not my footing, not myself, not what I think.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:23.780]   Conclusion, workless faith is worthless faith.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:27.720]   Authentic faith always acts,
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.540]   and the actions of authentic faith trust the Father,
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.520]   even if it comes at great cost to him.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:39.500]   There's a story of a guy named Charles Blondin.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:44.260]   Charles Blondin was a tightrope walker in the 1800s.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.460]   He lived in France, and he was so successful
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.100]   that eventually he was recruited to come to America.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.500]   In the 1800s, there was not a ton of entertainment,
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.100]   so a huge crowd would show up
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.540]   because there wasn't, at that time,
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.300]   Mavs games and PS5,
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.260]   there wasn't anything like that to entertain yourself,
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.300]   so people would flock to come see this guy.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.020]   By the thousands, Charles Blondin,
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.520]   known as the Great Blondin.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.800]   He had mastered tightrope walking so much
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.960]   that he was able to walk across Niagara Falls,
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.060]   which is 1,100 feet long, on a three-inch rope.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.520]   He could walk across in the 1800s.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.460]   He got so good at it that he was able
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.400]   to not just walk across,
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.760]   one point he walked in stilts,
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.900]   one point he walked across blindfolded,
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.480]   one point he got midway through the rope
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.320]   that was going across,
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.920]   and he sat down and he cooked an egg,
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   ate the egg, stood back up, walked back.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.680]   One day, he pulls out a wheelbarrow,
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.400]   gets the wheelbarrow, takes his big sack of potatoes,
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.880]   throws the sack of potatoes in the wheelbarrow.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.280]   Crowd's going nuts, and he's like,
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.060]   you think I can walk across with a wheelbarrow?
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.360]   Of course you can, you're the Great Blondin.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.760]   Crowd's going nuts, they got Blondin bobbleheads,
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.660]   they're just going crazy over Blondin.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:55.200]   He walks across, wheelbarrow across,
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.160]   goes halfway, comes back, crowd's going nuts.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:03.600]   Says, who thinks that I can walk across this tightrope
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.680]   with a person in the wheelbarrow?
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.720]   Crowd goes nuts.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.240]   Of course you can, you're the Great Blondin.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.400]   Calms him down.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.760]   Who's gonna get in the wheelbarrow?
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:20.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.680]   Silence.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.400]   Until one person comes forward,
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.080]   gets in the wheelbarrow.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.200]   That person was his manager.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.280]   He'd gone everywhere with him,
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.360]   he'd seen every time he'd done anything on a tightrope,
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.720]   he'd seen all the different feats that he'd done,
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.440]   and through that, his faith grew and grew and grew.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.240]   So when it came to Blondin, he believed.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.760]   Man, I don't just believe you could,
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.760]   I believe it so much that I will.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.880]   It's a very sharp difference between the person
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.800]   who steps out of that crowd and the crowd who says,
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.680]   I believe, but not really.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.880]   How do you think he got that way?
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.040]   Well, it's clear, he saw it.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.200]   Every single time that he saw the way that Blondin acted,
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.120]   his faith, his confidence, and his ability to do,
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.040]   to walk across a tightrope, even with a person,
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.800]   even with hundreds of pounds of potatoes in there,
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.960]   I believe you can do it,
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.420]   and his confidence grew every single time.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.240]   When it comes to your faith, it's like a muscle
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.680]   that God wants you to have the type of intimate relationship
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.700]   where every time that you trust him, it's gonna grow.
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.200]   You're gonna be like Blondin's manager,
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.840]   where I have seen what you've done,
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.600]   I've seen you show up in my life,
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.720]   I've seen the way that when you say,
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.080]   how I'm supposed to think about my job,
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.200]   how I'm supposed to treat my parents,
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.880]   how I'm supposed to handle conflict,
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.200]   how I'm not supposed to gossip,
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.640]   I've seen how it goes better,
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.680]   how that's a better way to live, and I trust you.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.440]   And every time you decide to be obedient,
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.260]   you know what happens?
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.120]   Your faith grows.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.640]   It's like a muscle, it gets stronger.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:47.360]   And James says, authentic faith,
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:53.220]   trust, one step, one step, one step, one step.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:57.240]   And as it grows and grows,
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.360]   it gets to the point where Abraham and Rahab,
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.560]   whatever you call me to, God, I trust you.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.840]   I've seen you show up before,
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.200]   I've seen you move in my life, and I trust you.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.000]   Because living faith grows.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.240]   And it grows through step by step obedience,
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.960]   whatever that looks like in your life.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.800]   Tomorrow when you wake up and you make the decision,
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.880]   small, ordinary moments, I'm gonna trust you, God,
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.320]   I'm gonna live like you say.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.440]   And when you do, your faith grows.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.200]   Moment by moment.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.640]   James did not always have a living faith,
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.540]   land in the plane.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.280]   I think one of the reasons he's so passionate,
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.480]   you read the verses, you're like, dang, James,
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.540]   you're just like, boom,
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.240]   is because James spent so many years,
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.360]   he grew up as a little Jewish boy,
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.880]   and he had this dead religion, dead faith,
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.680]   for years and years and years,
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.280]   until one day his brother comes back from the grave,
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.160]   and he decides, I'm gonna go all in,
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.560]   I believe who you say you are, Jesus.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.480]   You died on the cross for my sins.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.320]   My brother paid for my sin.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.200]   He paid for your sin, paid for every sin
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.480]   that ever has been committed by all of humanity,
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:03.160]   because he loved the world so much, he would give his life.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.020]   And he believed that, and all of a sudden,
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:09.120]   his dead Jewish religion became a living, active,
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.860]   life-changing faith, and he spent the rest of his life
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:15.360]   telling the world about the Messiah who can save anybody,
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.000]   no matter what they've done,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.160]   if they'll simply receive that free gift
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.520]   that Jesus has offered them,
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.320]   when he offered his life for them, for you, for me,
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.200]   and then begin to walk in light of that faith
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.960]   and live it out, not to earn God's love,
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.880]   but because you have it already.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.960]   And the faith grows, and I think he's so passionate,
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.360]   'cause he lived dead faith, and then he had living faith,
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.800]   and he gave his life.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.680]   And years later, after Jesus, his brother,
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.340]   had gone back to heaven, he was killed for his faith,
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:51.160]   for the living Messiah that he believed in,
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:56.260]   that his living faith was used to spread the message
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.020]   of the gospel all over the ancient world.
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:00.920]   That same living faith is alive inside of this room
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.000]   through so many of you who are living and operating
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.160]   based on your faith.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.480]   You made decisions today
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.400]   because you believe he's the son of God.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.240]   He's real, he's alive, he's king, and you operate,
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.320]   and I'm so proud of you.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.840]   Others of you, you need to hear this.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.000]   You're not a believer, you're not a Christian.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.560]   I love you, I don't have any motive
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.480]   other than I want you to spend eternity with God in heaven,
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.800]   but that only happens one way,
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.440]   not through being a better person or trying harder tomorrow.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.500]   It happens through accepting the free gift of Jesus
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:26.340]   on the cross.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.160]   I believe you, God.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.560]   I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.800]   I don't deserve to go to heaven, I'm a sinner.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.720]   I'll never be able to earn my relationship with you,
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.300]   but I believe you died for me,
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:40.460]   and I receive your gift.
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.720]   You died in my place,
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.080]   and I'm gonna live eternally with you
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:49.740]   because you made a way, and I believe that.
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.280]   James says that's living faith,
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.960]   and that's the type of faith that begins to transform a life,
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.280]   eventually the world around you.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.440]   Let me pray.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:08.700]   Father, there is no one here who you,
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:12.980]   or who anyone in the world loves as much as you do.
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:17.380]   Every person here is loved more by you than their parents,
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.120]   than their spouse, than their future spouse,
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.020]   than anyone who has ever lived.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:25.520]   No one wants them to spend eternity
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.160]   in heaven more than you do,
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.360]   and so I pray that you would do what only you can do,
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.560]   which is right now, you would soften hearts of people
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.280]   who are lying to themselves,
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.280]   saying, "I actually believe that,"
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.000]   or, "I am a Christian, I'm gonna try harder,"
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.360]   and you would pierce through the noise and the fog
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:47.560]   and the lies and the religion,
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:52.100]   and you would allow them to, in their heart,
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:56.240]   believe you're who you say you are.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.720]   Son of God who died in our place,
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.120]   who gave your life for us and came back alive,
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.160]   and because of that, if we receive that gift,
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.040]   we will live forever.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:10.160]   I pray that you would allow living faith to mark our lives,
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.000]   in any parts of my heart and any of our hearts
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.100]   of those who know you,
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:18.100]   where there is lack of life and there's death,
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.520]   would you take ground, would you start with me?
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.760]   Help us to be more and more like Jesus,
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.840]   the Son of God, the Savior of the world,
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.280]   the half-brother of James.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.080]   We worship you in song, amen.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:40.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
