1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,420
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:23,900
 - Hey Dallas, it's great to be with you.

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,220
 Fort Worth, much love to you from afar

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,760
 and everyone else that's listening in

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,980
 from around the country.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,240
 It's great to be with you tonight.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,440
 I wanna start by asking you a question.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,360
 Has anyone ever heard of Cannacock?

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,080
 (audience cheering)

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,920
 Strong response.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,360
 I had never heard of it, I've gotta confess.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,240
 But then I did hear of it when I came around some folks

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,520
 who had been involved there

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,760
 and came to appreciate the place's influence.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,920
 Finally got a chance to go.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,740
 If you don't know what this is,

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,880
 I wanna bring everyone together.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,400
 It's a Christian camp in Branson, Missouri.

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,800
 It's a beautiful piece of land and property.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,240
 And I got a chance to go there.

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,540
 JP was invited to teach.

23
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,640
 I got invited to go and hold the bags and open the doors

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,200
 and maybe tell like a joke or two.

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,720
 And so we end up there at Cannacock together

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,520
 and he is preaching at a young adults gathering.

27
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,240
 And so we're there to set the scene.

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,480
 It's a chapel on the side of a mountain.

29
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,960
 It's absolutely beautiful.

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,480
 And so the worship felt great.

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,340
 The room, the community felt cozy.

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,920
 It was probably 70 or 80 guys or girls

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,100
 who all knew each other.

34
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,200
 And afterward, so worship happens,

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
 JP teaches, worship song to close, pretty standard fare.

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,020
 And then afterward, it kind of starts to break up.

37
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,200
 People start to get into circles and talk.

38
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,320
 And at the end of that, I find myself up near the front,

39
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,960
 near the worship leader, JP and he were talking.

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,200
 I found myself not really a key player in the discussion.

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,480
 And so I kind of started to back up and look around

42
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,180
 and I saw the guy's guitar sitting right there on a stand.

43
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,800
 And now I love guitars.

44
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,200
 I'm not good at guitar.

45
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,160
 That's not where this is going.

46
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,960
 There's a reason why I was invited to visit

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,420
 after the worship part was already over tonight.

48
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,880
 But I know how to hold one.

49
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,440
 Like I enjoy it, like it's fun.

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,360
 And so I saw an opportunity sitting right there.

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,200
 It was also beautiful.

52
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,480
 I didn't really, I wasn't able to appreciate

53
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
 how beautiful at the time.

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,920
 And so I, but I asked the question,

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,880
 which feels pretty standard amongst guitar players.

56
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,000
 Not that he knew I was one such person,

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,440
 but I asked him, "Hey, can I play your guitar?"

58
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,440
 And he said, "Yes."

59
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,560
 But it was one of those yeses

60
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,040
 that didn't really give you a confidence

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,160
 that it was a yes in here.

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,080
 You know, it was kind of,

63
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,200
 there was like some strings attached.

64
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,620
 It was like, "Yeah, sure."

65
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,560
 And even JP kind of, when I asked him,

66
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,080
 he kind of turned his head a little faster

67
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,920
 than he normally would.

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,840
 I was like, "These guys need to loosen up.

69
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,680
 "Give me this thing."

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
 And so I picked it up,

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,160
 thinking I'm gonna demonstrate and just redeem myself.

72
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,520
 And so I start to play it a little bit

73
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
 and I'm really enjoying it.

74
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
 I mean, it's beautiful, but,

75
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,280
 and so I'm playing it and they continue to talk,

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
 but I still feel like they're watching me a little bit.

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,720
 So it's making me more nervous than anything.

78
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,440
 So I'm not really able to enjoy the thing.

79
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,440
 So I put it down and we walk outside.

80
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,520
 And as soon as we walk outside the chapel,

81
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,840
 I look left and JP's right there.

82
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,800
 And I looked at him

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,920
 and as if to say, "What was going on in there?"

84
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,440
 And before I got a chance to ask that question,

85
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,440
 he said, "That guitar cost $20,000."

86
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,640
 Well, you should get me two for Christmas then

87
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,040
 and see if they're that good of a deal.

88
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,080
 So $20,000 was the cost of this guitar.

89
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,400
 And I had no idea about that.

90
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,080
 And some more information starts to kind of come available

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,920
 about the guitars.

92
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,880
 He said, "Yeah, it's made of sunken redwood."

93
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,980
 And so what that means is it's wood

94
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,560
 that's been compressed by a creek.

95
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,580
 They literally dig it out from under a creek

96
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,040
 because wood that's been compressed like that

97
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,080
 makes a beautiful sound.

98
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,360
 I didn't know any of this.

99
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,780
 And so the guitar is literally a masterpiece,

100
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,840
 like as in best guitar in the world kind of thing.

101
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,980
 And so I realized in that moment,

102
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,960
 I hadn't been reckless with the guitar.

103
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,920
 I didn't try to damage it or anything,

104
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,040
 but I definitely underappreciated it

105
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,320
 because I approached it with such confidence.

106
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,440
 I was overconfident.

107
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,380
 I assumed more and I approached it with a familiarity

108
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,800
 that just wasn't really healthy

109
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,680
 and wasn't helpful for the value that the guitar had.

110
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,100
 And so at the end of it,

111
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,680
 I didn't really feel angry or embarrassed.

112
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,320
 I did feel like I had missed out

113
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,440
 because I had held more guitar than I will ever hold again.

114
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,720
 I will see Jesus before I hold a guitar again.

115
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,880
 That that has that.

116
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,360
 Okay, so for perspective,

117
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,480
 that's twice as much as my Honda Civic.

118
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,520
 That would buy half of my college degree.

119
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,100
 If I drop it, I have a new mortgage.

120
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,940
 You with me?

121
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,760
 I mean, this is scary.

122
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,000
 And so instead, normally,

123
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,280
 if I had known that on the front end,

124
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,520
 if I had realized what I was approaching was that valuable,

125
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,240
 I wouldn't have treated it as if it was so familiar,

126
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,880
 so routine, so easy, so nonchalantly.

127
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,520
 And so instead, at the end,

128
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,480
 then I would have instead approached it, enjoyed it more.

129
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,200
 And then I would have been able to appreciate it.

130
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,320
 And then instead, I was left feeling like

131
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,700
 I couldn't even remember what that was like.

132
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,960
 And I missed out.

133
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,360
 I missed the experience of the guitar.

134
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,440
 And here's why that's our starting point for tonight.

135
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,320
 Because if you have any exposure whatsoever

136
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,800
 to the story of Jesus,

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
 even if you're not really a church person or a Bible person,

138
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,100
 if you've heard of Jesus,

139
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,840
 you've probably heard him associated

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,200
 with this thing called the cross.

141
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,640
 And know that that's somehow central

142
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,280
 to the message of Jesus.

143
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,120
 And it absolutely is.

144
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,400
 It's the most valuable part of his story, of his life,

145
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,480
 second maybe only to the resurrection.

146
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,400
 And so I think that we're in danger

147
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,600
 of missing out in the cross what I missed out on the guitar.

148
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,880
 And that's this, that the cross is so familiar to us,

149
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,360
 it's so routine to us, we see it everywhere,

150
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,960
 that it is difficult for us to appreciate

151
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,840
 what is actually being communicated to us from it.

152
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,760
 How valuable it is, how worth it, how worthy it is,

153
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,040
 how precious that it actually is.

154
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,420
 And I think that's due to familiarity.

155
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,000
 Think about all the places you see the cross.

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
 It's all over the place.

157
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,420
 You see it on walls, you see it hanging around.

158
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,540
 We beautify it, we encrust it with jewels,

159
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,720
 and we make it really decorative,

160
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,360
 and we try to make it pretty,

161
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,480
 and we put it on our necks, and we put it on our wrists,

162
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
 and we put it on our T-shirts.

163
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,520
 It's like how did it get on the back pockets of your jeans?

164
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,480
 What is the cross doing there?

165
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,200
 And so it has somehow become like ubiquitous.

166
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,320
 I mean, it's everywhere,

167
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,800
 and it continues to seem to lose its meaning a little bit.

168
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,140
 Because that's what happens

169
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,720
 when something becomes increasingly familiar.

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,800
 As we stop approaching it as if it's worthwhile and valuable.

171
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,160
 And if there's any symbol in the history of the world,

172
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,020
 big statement, if there's any symbol

173
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,940
 in the history of the world

174
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,240
 that's lost its original connotation,

175
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,340
 its original meaning, it's the cross.

176
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,300
 The cross was an instrument of torture.

177
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,020
 It was designed to produce the most excruciating death ever.

178
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,620
 It would be akin to like the electric chair,

179
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,460
 or the gallows, or the guillotine.

180
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,900
 And so if you wanna get a little closer to the cross,

181
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,300
 imagine instead of coming into like a church,

182
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,180
 where I grew up there was a cross in the background,

183
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,020
 but there was like the podium,

184
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,900
 and then there was the cross.

185
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,100
 And so imagine walking into an environment like that,

186
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,200
 and instead of seeing a cross,

187
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,660
 you see an electric chair sitting there on stage.

188
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,740
 Or imagine coming out of the children's wing

189
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,060
 of Vacation Bible School,

190
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,740
 or Vacation Bible School,

191
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,860
 and instead of seeing people

192
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,620
 with little crosses made out of yarn,

193
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,220
 and little decorative crosses around their necks,

194
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,860
 instead they've got hangman's nooses

195
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,700
 hanging around their neck.

196
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,520
 And they come up and say,

197
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,460
 "Hey, mommy, look what they taught me today.

198
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,100
 "Now we're getting warm."

199
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,760
 That is the original connotation of the cross.

200
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,900
 And so what I wanna do,

201
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,940
 and so it's so easy for us to be so confident

202
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,340
 on this subject, it's so easy.

203
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,820
 And I know the skeptic wants to rise up,

204
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,620
 and so, because I know how it is, man.

205
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,380
 It's like, you went to work,

206
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,460
 I'm not sure if I'm going to the porch.

207
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,700
 Okay, I'm going to the porch.

208
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,040
 I park, it's so far away.

209
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,380
 I came in, oh, it's so cloudy, it's still cloudy.

210
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,620
 I come in, it's crowded again,

211
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,500
 and I go through the worship,

212
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
 and it's like, it's really loud.

213
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,340
 And then the message comes on,

214
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,140
 "It's not even JP."

215
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,300
 (congregation laughing)

216
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,580
 And then we're talking about the cross,

217
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,980
 we're talking Jesus 101, okay?

218
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,980
 But I wanna tell you, I wanna call all those things,

219
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,580
 and so, come on, come with me.

220
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,620
 And so, I'm gonna go ahead and call all those things

221
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,440
 barriers for you tonight.

222
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,140
 I'm gonna call all those assumptions,

223
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,860
 and all that confidence, and all that skepticism,

224
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,780
 and all that, I already know this,

225
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,180
 I'm gonna lump all that together,

226
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,060
 and I'm gonna write on that bag barriers,

227
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,220
 and I'm gonna invite you with me to put that outside,

228
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,520
 and instead come ready to see the cross in a new way.

229
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,100
 So that's what we're gonna do tonight.

230
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,460
 (congregation applauding)

231
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,420
 So I wanna show you three things specifically tonight.

232
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,380
 First, that the cross anchors in history.

233
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,820
 I'll tell you what that means.

234
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,100
 First, that the cross anchors in history.

235
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,540
 Secondly, that the cross defeats all sin.

236
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,300
 I'll give you three specific ways that it does that,

237
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,420
 and that second point, and then lastly,

238
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,660
 that the cross ends all fear, it ends all fear.

239
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,460
 So that's where we'll finish tonight, that's the roadmap.

240
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,700
 And so first, the cross anchors in history.

241
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,820
 What does it mean that the cross anchors in history?

242
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,900
 Well, to understand what that means,

243
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,220
 I wanna give you a definition tonight for the cross.

244
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,220
 And when I'm saying the cross,

245
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,700
 I don't mean the symbol tonight.

246
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,360
 When I say the cross, I don't even mean

247
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,160
 the actual instrument, the actual wooden thing.

248
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,740
 What I mean is a scene, I mean an event.

249
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,020
 And so when you hear me say the cross,

250
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,340
 what I mean is an event, an actual historical event

251
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,900
 that really happened.

252
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,700
 And that's important because somehow,

253
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,420
 in spiritual matters in our day and age,

254
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,700
 it seems really popular.

255
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
 When it comes to spiritual matters

256
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,380
 and we really start to dive in,

257
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,420
 when we see something of spiritual significance,

258
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,140
 for some reason we wanna picture it as ethereal

259
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,980
 or mystical or kinda cloudy and fuzzy and out there,

260
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,020
 but the cross is something that actually happened

261
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,580
 in real history.

262
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,060
 Like if you went far enough mileage-wise

263
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,500
 and were able to go back far enough time-wise,

264
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,060
 you could show up.

265
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,660
 It's just as real as the fact that you woke up this morning,

266
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,460
 that you went to the ATM yesterday,

267
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,660
 that the War of 1812 happened,

268
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,940
 nobody knows much about that,

269
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,460
 that doesn't really prompt a response,

270
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,020
 but that Columbus sailed the ocean blue,

271
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,340
 all of these things are real.

272
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,900
 I'm giving you all these images

273
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,200
 and they all have one thing in common,

274
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,140
 they're real events that really happened in history.

275
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,180
 In three dimensions, people with real feelings

276
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,940
 took part in these things.

277
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,020
 And the cross does not operate in some separate sphere,

278
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,420
 it's real, it's tangible.

279
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,660
 If you had shown up, are you ready for this?

280
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,620
 If you had shown up and seen it,

281
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,740
 you could have captured it with an iPhone,

282
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,580
 you could have recorded it.

283
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,620
 So when you see something memorable,

284
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,220
 out comes the iPhone, you start to record.

285
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,700
 And the reason I know that

286
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,100
 is because the very best recording technology of the day

287
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,220
 was ink on paper, and that's exactly what they used

288
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,980
 to bring this history to us.

289
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,780
 And so as we approach the cross,

290
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,060
 I wanna tell you it's a historical thing,

291
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,140
 it's a real thing, and it's a brutal thing.

292
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,340
 And so the Romans perfected the cross

293
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,340
 as an execution method.

294
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,940
 And so it was called 1,000 deaths in one.

295
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,540
 It wasn't something you talked about casually

296
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,380
 before Sunday lunch, it was more like something

297
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,780
 the mothers would cover their kids ears at.

298
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,780
 And in fact, the cross did not become

299
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,700
 the symbol of Christianity,

300
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,860
 until everyone who had actually seen one had died.

301
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,300
 Until there was no more living memory whatsoever

302
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,100
 of the cross, it did not become the symbol of Christianity

303
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,300
 because the connotation was too gruesome.

304
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,700
 It's a real thing, it was anchored in history.

305
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,740
 I wanna give you a verse for that before we move on.

306
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,100
 It's 1 Corinthians 15, three through four,

307
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,940
 it goes like this.

308
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,420
 "For I delivered to you as of first importance

309
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,020
 "what I also received."

310
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,460
 Okay, pause, what does that sound like?

311
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,060
 This is history, he's taking it, I'm passing it on.

312
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,260
 I'm taking what I first heard of first importance

313
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,140
 and I'm delivering it on to you.

314
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,540
 I'm not modifying it, I'm not creating it,

315
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,940
 I'm not getting creative when I pass this history on to you,

316
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,780
 I'm taking it and I'm giving it on to you.

317
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,300
 That's the only way to pass on accurate history,

318
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,700
 and that's exactly the spirit

319
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,020
 that is taken by the New Testament.

320
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,780
 The New Testament does not treat the cross

321
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,820
 as if it's mystical, it treats it as if it's real.

322
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,340
 And so I pass these things on to you as of first importance

323
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,660
 that Christ died, there's your cross,

324
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,500
 Christ died for our sins.

325
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,340
 In accordance with the scriptures,

326
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,180
 that he was buried and rose on the third day

327
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,300
 in accordance with the scriptures.

328
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,620
 The cross anchors in history.

329
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,140
 My second point this evening

330
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,700
 is that the cross defeats all sin.

331
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,060
 The cross defeats all sin.

332
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,780
 And so I wanna give you three ways,

333
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,900
 they all start with P in this section,

334
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,060
 that the cross defeats all sin.

335
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,340
 It has to do with the penalty of sin,

336
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,940
 the power of sin and the presence of sin.

337
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,340
 So we're gonna go through that together.

338
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,980
 So the cross removes the penalty of sin.

339
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,980
 And before I even tell you what that means,

340
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,780
 it feels like that could be news,

341
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,220
 like that there's sin and that there's a penalty.

342
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,060
 And so that can catch you by surprise.

343
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,780
 And then, oh, there's this thing that's called sin,

344
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,620
 there's this, then I have a penalty to pay,

345
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,060
 and whoa, it's already paid.

346
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,460
 That would be like, imagine for a second

347
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,660
 that you come home from work and you show up

348
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,620
 and your roommate's there, they're looking right at you.

349
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,580
 And they say, "Hey, I paid your bill."

350
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,580
 Like, who are you, what have you done with my roommate?

351
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,540
 I have a great roommate, by the way,

352
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,500
 it would not be unusual.

353
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,660
 But imagine that your roommate says to you,

354
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,580
 "I paid your bill."

355
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,260
 It's like, oh man, that's great, thank you.

356
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,180
 What bill did you pay?

357
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,660
 Water?

358
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,500
 40 bucks?

359
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,700
 No?

360
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,540
 Did you pay the electricity?

361
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,260
 90 bucks?

362
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,780
 I know you didn't pay the rent.

363
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,740
 I want you to imagine he looks back at you and says,

364
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,380
 "I paid your taxes."

365
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,340
 The ones you didn't know about?

366
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,780
 Yeah, the IRS called, 100,000, paid.

367
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,940
 Just for you, free gift.

368
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,180
 Penalty you didn't know you had,

369
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,940
 that you couldn't pay, paid.

370
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,660
 Free gift, that's it.

371
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,140
 You would respond a little bit differently

372
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,980
 than if they paid the water bill.

373
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,340
 You would respond strongly because there is freedom now

374
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,420
 from a penalty that would have been imposed upon you.

375
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,700
 And so Romans chapter three, verse 23,

376
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,180
 this is a familiar verse for some.

377
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,420
 It says, "For all have sinned

378
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,780
 "and fall short of the glory of God."

379
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,700
 All, and so I'm not a Greek scholar,

380
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,740
 I wanna give you that confession.

381
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,980
 I'm not a Greek scholar.

382
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,420
 I am confident that if we did a word study of the word all,

383
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,660
 it would come back A-L-L, all.

384
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,820
 Like, all have sinned, every single one of us have sinned

385
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,380
 and fallen short of the glory of God,

386
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,980
 and are, but, but are justified by his grace

387
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,820
 as a free gift, penalty paid.

388
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,300
 And so I wanna show you something in this next paragraph

389
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,540
 that's worth underlining, it's worth paying attention to.

390
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,020
 Not just that the penalty is paid,

391
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,580
 but actually the method through which it was done.

392
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,940
 And so this is the next verse.

393
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,580
 It says, "This was to show God's righteousness."

394
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
 What's his righteousness?

395
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,740
 Just his rightness, his perfection, his rightness.

396
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,460
 "This," this cross, "was to show God's rightness

397
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,100
 "because in his divine forbearance," his patience,

398
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,420
 "he had passed over former sins."

399
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,660
 Okay, so here's what that means.

400
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,180
 "At the beginning of history,

401
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,620
 "when human beings started to sin,"

402
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,180
 because remember, all human beings have sinned

403
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,300
 and fallen short of the glory of God,

404
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,780
 beginning with the very first one.

405
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,500
 And so as soon as human beings started to sin,

406
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,020
 God didn't just start unleashing justice on them

407
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,100
 as soon as they did.

408
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
 Although that would have, that would not,

409
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,260
 he would not have ceased to be God and be good

410
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,420
 if he had done that.

411
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,420
 He wasn't just unleashing the arrows of justice

412
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,140
 every time somebody would sin.

413
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,460
 Instead, he waited, he passed over former sins.

414
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,340
 And when it was time to let the arrow of justice fly,

415
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,900
 he pointed it at the one person

416
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,460
 who had never done anything wrong ever.

417
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,300
 And so for all of humanity,

418
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,460
 for everyone who has ever lived and ever sinned,

419
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,580
 he passed over those sins until the time that Jesus came.

420
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,780
 It says, "This was to show his righteousness

421
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,460
 "at the present time," that's at the time of the cross,

422
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,740
 "so that he might be,"

423
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,580
 and these next four words are huge,

424
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,580
 "just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus."

425
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,820
 The just and the justifier.

426
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,980
 This arrangement happened so that God

427
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,460
 could be the just and the justifier.

428
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,300
 What does that mean?

429
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,620
 At the cross, you might have heard this before,

430
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,060
 at the cross, we see an intersection

431
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,860
 of two things really vividly.

432
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,620
 We see God's love and we see God's justice.

433
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,540
 We see God's love and we see God's justice.

434
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,300
 Justice, let's talk about first.

435
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,260
 Justice is something that means

436
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,820
 it's just simply to right the wrongs.

437
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,140
 To make wrong things right, that's what justice is.

438
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,620
 That's what judges do.

439
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,900
 That's what good ones do.

440
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,380
 And sometimes we wanna come down on God for his justice.

441
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,860
 It makes us a little uncomfortable inside.

442
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,740
 But I just wanna remind us

443
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,780
 that good judges make wrong things right.

444
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,700
 In the state of Texas,

445
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
 if judges don't make wrong things right,

446
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,260
 you fire them, okay, like they're done.

447
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,580
 And so we all know that good judges make wrong things right.

448
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,740
 This is exactly what God does.

449
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,220
 You can see that at the cross.

450
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,500
 Look at the man on it, he's crushed.

451
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,620
 The one from whom this punishment came

452
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,520
 must have been very serious about the wrong that was done.

453
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,340
 You can see the justice that's carried out there.

454
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,460
 You can also see God's love at the cross

455
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,740
 because oh yeah, that's not any of us on it

456
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,060
 who deserved it, who should have been there.

457
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,020
 And so what the phrase means, just and the justifier,

458
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,380
 is that God didn't come down to earth

459
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,460
 just to be exactly right.

460
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,300
 God praised God that he did not come all the way down here

461
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,140
 just to be exactly right.

462
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,300
 He came down here and was exactly right

463
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,700
 and made all the wrong people right.

464
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,780
 Set them right with him.

465
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,540
 That's what it means to justify someone,

466
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,020
 to set them right, to give them right standing before God.

467
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,980
 And so at the cross, you see Jesus

468
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:33,340
 pinned by God's justice out of God's love for us

469
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,540
 so that God might be shown to be both just

470
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,500
 and the justifier.

471
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,300
 There are, you think there's more at the cross

472
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,820
 than you thought there was?

473
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,860
 It's four words in your Bible.

474
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,700
 It's amazing.

475
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,420
 So the cross removes the penalty of sin.

476
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,460
 The cross also removes the power of sin.

477
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,140
 You ever felt like sin was gonna have its

478
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,500
 final way over you?

479
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,620
 You ever felt like sin just had its ultimate power over you,

480
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,220
 like the strongest force in your life was sin?

481
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,540
 And so before you know it, you look up

482
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
 and you start to think things like this.

483
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,580
 Narcissism and self-centeredness will always

484
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,620
 have its way over me.

485
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,260
 Porn will always be a part of my life.

486
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,980
 It just will be.

487
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,740
 Anger and losing self-control, it's just gonna mark me.

488
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,340
 That's what it sounds like to feel like

489
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,300
 sin has its ultimate power over you.

490
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,020
 And that's about as hopeless as it gets.

491
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,580
 To think that your entire future is gonna be marked out

492
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,660
 by either a past history or a present tendency

493
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,300
 because of the power of sin is going to affect

494
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,180
 your entire future.

495
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,460
 To feel marked in that way is about as hopeless

496
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,100
 as I can possibly imagine.

497
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,220
 I've been there.

498
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,460
 Thought all those things.

499
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,580
 And they are lies.

500
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,380
 And I know that because of what Romans chapter six says.

501
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,500
 This is verse six.

502
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,860
 It says, "We know that our old self was crucified with him."

503
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,660
 Okay, our old self, that's the part, you know,

504
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,380
 that was not able not to sin.

505
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,460
 Not able not to sin, but that old self

506
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,700
 that was captive to sin was crucified, there's the cross,

507
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,180
 pinned to the cross associated with Jesus.

508
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,980
 So the part of you that was powerless,

509
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,740
 the part of you that was unable to keep from sinning

510
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,660
 was pinned onto the cross with Jesus.

511
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,620
 Why?

512
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,620
 "In order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing

513
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,660
 "so that we," that's you and I,

514
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,140
 Porch, Dallas, Fort Worth,

515
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,820
 "so that the body of sin that used to mark us

516
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,740
 "would be brought to nothing,

517
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,760
 "so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.

518
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,760
 "For one who has died has been set free from sin."

519
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,200
 So the part of you that was enslaved to sin

520
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,200
 is associated strongly with Jesus

521
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,120
 and completely with Jesus on the cross.

522
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,200
 And so today, sin's power over you is gone.

523
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,120
 If you're in Christ, if you trusted in Christ

524
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,200
 for the forgiveness of your sins,

525
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,080
 and trusted in his death and resurrection

526
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,340
 and his work on your behalf,

527
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,740
 that means sin does not have to mark you today or any day.

528
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,120
 To put it as simply as possible,

529
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
 you don't have to do those things anymore.

530
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,040
 That's the beauty of the cross.

531
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,280
 And the separating power of shame is done.

532
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
 The separating power, this is what sin does.

533
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,680
 This is its greatest tool, it's to separate us from God.

534
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,040
 It's what it does and it's its result.

535
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,800
 And instead, Christ brings us back

536
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,280
 and through the power of his death on the cross,

537
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,680
 gives us an all-access pass back to God.

538
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,600
 That's good news.

539
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
 A couple of years ago, I was in Atlanta

540
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,960
 for a gathering of Christians at a conference.

541
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,040
 And so I'd never done that before.

542
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,880
 I trusted Christ when I was about 20 years old.

543
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,640
 And I'd never really gone to a big gathering

544
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,720
 of Jesus followers.

545
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,360
 That was not really my scene.

546
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,640
 And, but we showed up in Atlanta for this gathering.

547
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,000
 I was a new believer in Christ and we get there

548
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,680
 and I would find out later

549
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,920
 that there were gonna be 20,000 people at this event.

550
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,800
 It was gonna be at Phillips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia,

551
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,880
 where the Hawks play.

552
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,360
 And so, that's the Atlanta, oh wait, is it Hawks?

553
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,240
 Yes, the Atlanta Hawks, sorry.

554
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,680
 I'm not really a basketball person, forgive me.

555
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,880
 So we show up and we think, we drove all through the night.

556
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,960
 So we drove midnight, this is January 1st, 2010.

557
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,240
 We drove from midnight to noon

558
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,840
 to get from Dallas to Atlanta.

559
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,240
 And so we get there, the conference doesn't start

560
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,960
 until seven and we thought, well, we'll get there

561
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,680
 about an hour and a half, maybe two hours early

562
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,360
 to make sure we get a really good seat.

563
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,800
 Instead, we crash, wake up and then realize,

564
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,360
 okay, the event starts in a few minutes

565
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,160
 and we're a mile away from the site.

566
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,000
 And so we're gonna crash, wake up,

567
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
 and then we're gonna crash, wake up,

568
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,760
 and then we're gonna crash, wake up,

569
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,800
 and then we're gonna crash, wake up,

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,840

 There's nothing better than that.

1145

 So we'll respond to you now,

1146
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,800
 just by saying thank you to you from our hearts,

1147
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,560
 that you bought us back from the penalty,

1148
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,120
 the power, and the presence of sin.

1149
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,560
 You've ended our fears, and we can rest tonight,

1150
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,560
 maybe for the first time in a long time.

1151
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,120
 Whether we're in Dallas or in the Ridgely Theater,

1152
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,480
 whether we've got headphones in our ears,

1153
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,760
 we're watching on a phone or a TV,

1154
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,000
 we can rest right now,

1155
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,360
 because the word that Jesus spoke is alive today.
