[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.040]   - Well hey Dallas, hello Fort Worth,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.160]   how y'all doing tonight?
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.120]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.680]   Yeah, it is good to be with the porch on a Tuesday.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.600]   I always love it, even when I'm not here in body,
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.880]   I am here in spirit.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.360]   I love to be with my friends,
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240]   and we're gonna dive in and we're gonna learn something.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.820]   I think you're gonna look at a part of the Bible tonight
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.540]   that is probably as crucial and essential for you
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.320]   as people that I believe are the hope
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.240]   of our future generations, our country.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.240]   We need you to understand what I'm gonna teach tonight.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.800]   If you are just making your way here tonight
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.760]   for the first time in a while,
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.920]   we're making our way through Matthew's chapter five,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.920]   six, and seven.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.440]   We're calling it Summer on the Mount,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.040]   and we are studying what this guy named Jesus said
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.500]   the very first time he broke onto the scene.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.080]   And he is breaking what had been 400 years of silence,
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.840]   of not hearing any word from God.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.680]   The people were without God and without hope in the world,
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.680]   and they had done what men always do,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.180]   they created for themselves some system
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.840]   that they would basically base their righteousness on,
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.880]   and that they would make themselves feel good
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.480]   about themselves and at peace with themselves.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.520]   And then here comes God saying,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.040]   "You can try and convince yourself
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.540]   "that you have found the way to peace,
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.260]   "but there is no peace apart from me,
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.160]   "the Prince of Peace, the King of Peace.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.900]   "And there's been no peace in this world for a long time
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.120]   "since you tried to find life apart from me."
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.020]   And so here comes God in his kindness,
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.400]   not looking to chew us out,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.220]   not looking to read us a riot act,
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.560]   but he starts with these amazing words.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.960]   He says, "Man, you want it to go well with you?
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.440]   "You wanna be blessed?
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.240]   "I'm your creator, I'm your Father, I'm your loving God.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.080]   "I want you to be blessed, so tune in."
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.560]   He starts by telling them they're gonna be blessed
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.800]   if they understand that left to themselves
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.680]   and their own strength and their own way,
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.800]   it's never gonna go well with them.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.000]   They're not gods, they're not perfect,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.880]   they're not infinite, they're not omniscient.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.760]   And so acknowledge what you lack,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.380]   and I will give you what you need.
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.420]   What a great way for it to start.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.500]   When we started this little series
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.620]   called Summer of the Mount,
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.220]   I had the chance to walk you through
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.540]   those first few passages,
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.660]   and I talk about how many have said this view of God
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.980]   that he's gonna show up, he's gonna wear us out,
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.700]   he's gonna tell us all the things we've done wrong
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.460]   and how we better get it right or we're in trouble.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.540]   Now he does get to that in this text,
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.640]   but what he's really doing is he's trying to say,
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.920]   "I'm not mad at you,
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.840]   "I just wanna know if you're sick and tired
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.180]   "of being sick and tired,
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.820]   "and I'm here to offer you a better way,
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.320]   "and by the way, this same Jesus said,
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.140]   "I am the way, I am the truth, and I am the life."
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.040]   Now it's crazy when you go to the Bible
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.240]   to try and figure out how you should live
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.500]   or how you should respond,
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.040]   if you aren't careful with this book,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.320]   it's gonna screw you up.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.200]   It's gonna mess you up.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.920]   Because you might come to it with a sense of,
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.180]   "Hey man, if anybody ever quotes to me
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.600]   "something from the Bible,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   "I better respond to it quickly and fully."
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.160]   Now that is not in and of itself a bad idea
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.280]   as long as you understand that this is a difficult book,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.000]   and sometimes untaught and unstable people
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.620]   take it and distort it to their own destruction.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.780]   That's the Bible's words, not mine.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.360]   You find that warning in 2 Peter,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.160]   one of the guys that was closest to Jesus,
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.120]   one of the guys that Jesus said,
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.460]   "You're gonna be the foundation of the beginning
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.820]   "of the grace that I'm bringing,
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.340]   "Peter, you and others like you who know who I really am,
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.340]   "that acknowledge that I'm a God,
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.820]   "that I am the God, and that I'm good, and I am the way.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.980]   "You better make sure when you teach people what I said,
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.400]   "you teach them all of what I said.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.560]   "You teach them everything I commanded you."
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.680]   'Cause if they just take little pieces of it,
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.300]   it will not go well with them.
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.280]   Let me just show you a few things.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.300]   You know what the Bible tells you and says,
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.100]   in it there is no God?
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.940]   It says that.
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.140]   You know what the Bible says in it,
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.820]   and some people in this room believe
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.820]   that if you really know God and you love him
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.980]   and you let yourself be strengthened by him,
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.380]   you can do anything that you want.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.280]   You know what the Bible says?
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   That if you give, it is guaranteed that what you give
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.920]   will be multiplied and made beyond anything
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.140]   you ever imagined.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.840]   You know what the Bible says?
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.560]   That you are not to judge other people,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.840]   or you'll be judged.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.720]   You know what the Bible says?
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.760]   That God guarantees for you a future and a hope.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.780]   He's got plans for you for welfare and not calamity.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.760]   Now here's what's crazy about what I just said.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.600]   Some of you guys go,
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   "Man, he's quoting some of my favorite Bible verses."
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.360]   And to you, I say, "Whoa."
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.800]   About 10 years ago, I did a series
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.740]   with a bunch of my friends.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.060]   We call it The Most, where we just took a bunch
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.400]   of different verses in the Bible.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.280]   I talked about what I thought was the most important verse,
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.380]   the most misquoted verse.
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.060]   I talked about what I thought was the most misunderstood
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.880]   verse in the Bible.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.020]   I did about 10 of these.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.460]   And tonight, we are at the place in the Sermon on the Mount
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.560]   when more people take a verse and jerk it out of context
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.920]   and use it to the destruction of themselves and society
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.580]   than any place else in the Bible.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.380]   In fact, just a good thing to remember
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.180]   as we get charged in tonight,
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.340]   is that you should never read a Bible verse.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.360]   You hear what I said?
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.380]   I'm a pastor, and I'm telling you,
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.100]   you should never read a Bible verse.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.100]   What you should read is a Bible passage.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.580]   What you should read is books in the Bible.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.340]   What you should read is the story.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.380]   Now watch this, turn with me to Matthew chapter seven.
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.260]   That's where we are.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.960]   Now you can do that thanks to a guy named Stephen Lankton.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.420]   You might go, "Well, Todd, who is Stephen Lankton?"
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.580]   He was the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1227.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:00.060]   1227, that is about 1200 years after the Bible,
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.200]   actually about 900 years after the Bible was assimilated
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   for the very first time.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.980]   A guy named Stephen Lankton made it easy for me
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.540]   to communicate to you who might be on anybody's wildest
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.680]   imagination one day, have your own copy
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.060]   of the sacred text of God.
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.060]   And so that you would get there quickly,
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.720]   he put chapters on letters and books.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.540]   You see, when they were written,
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.860]   they weren't originally written with chapters.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.620]   And in fact, it wasn't until a couple hundred years later
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.980]   that a guy named Nathan, who was a Jewish rabbi,
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.100]   went and took Stephen's chapters
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.380]   and put inside of them verses.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.460]   And because of Nathan, some of you might believe
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.420]   that you could be silent and never speak up
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.260]   because God will fight for you.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.500]   Because you read Stephen Lankton's chapter 14
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.420]   and Nathan's verse 14 in Exodus.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.060]   And you read a Bible verse.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.580]   And that Bible verse says,
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.980]   "Hey, your God will fight for you.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.820]   "You just stay silent."
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.380]   And because some of you guys have obediently lived out
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.940]   that verse, and because churchmen have obediently lived out
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.940]   that verse, we live where we live today in 2015.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.340]   It was about another 300 years after Stephen Lankton
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.860]   that a guy named Estienne, also known as Stephanus,
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.100]   took Stephen Lankton's chapters
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.180]   and inserted verses into the New Testament.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.900]   What I'm telling you is that there was never a Bible verse
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.420]   that was written.
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.940]   Books were written, thoughts were written,
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.980]   and you have to be careful
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.000]   to not pull certain verses out of context.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.260]   Let me do this for you very quickly, all right?
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.900]   I said at the very beginning that the Bible says
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.860]   that there is no God.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.220]   This is the easiest one to disprove.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.380]   It comes from Psalm 14, verse one.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.140]   It also comes from Psalm 53, verse one.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.460]   What it actually says is,
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.740]   "The fool has said in his heart, there is no God."
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.900]   Obviously, with just a little bit more reading
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.380]   in the passage, you would find out that, of course,
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.740]   the Bible doesn't think there is no God.
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.780]   How about this one?
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.460]   I talked about the fact that God has plans for you
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.540]   for welfare and not for calamity,
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.860]   but to give you a future and a hope.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.740]   That is some of our favorite Bible verses.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.260]   Some of you guys got that tattooed on your bad self.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.820]   I know you do, right?
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.700]   You're like, "I don't really know much about God,
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.380]   "but, you know, welfare and future hope, man,
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.340]   "not calamity.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.340]   "I'm down with that God," right?
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.940]   So look, find verse.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.020]   What you don't know about that verse
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.900]   is it comes after a couple of other ideas.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.860]   And this is what it starts with in verse 10.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.660]   He's talking to Israel specifically
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.140]   that God uniquely chose to show Himself with.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.780]   And He says, "Look, I'm gonna send you
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.700]   "for 70 years in a timeout.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.320]   "I'm gonna whoop you and basically not protect you
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.020]   "and not bless you for 70 years.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.520]   "And so you better go and set up shop in Babylon,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.700]   "learn the language, improve their public school system,
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.000]   "work on their sewer system,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.720]   "do what you can to make Babylon a decent place
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.300]   "'cause you're gonna live there for a while,
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.840]   "but I'm not gonna forget you.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.400]   "And I know the plans I've got for you.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.280]   "It's what I told you a long time ago."
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.460]   And to that nation, He tells them,
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.460]   "Look, I have plans for welfare for you
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.280]   "and not for calamity.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.340]   "I'm gonna come to you.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.920]   "I'm gonna give you a future and a hope."
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.040]   Now listen, does that verse in some way,
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.100]   can you extrapolate that truth to you and I at some level?
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.880]   Yes, but it doesn't mean
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.120]   that it's gonna happen in your lifetime.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.240]   I mean, the Bible in fact says this.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.860]   It says that if you desire to live godly in Christ Jesus,
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.820]   you will be persecuted.
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.940]   The Bible says, "Why are you surprised
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.760]   "at the fiery ordeal among you?"
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.220]   The Bible says, "You wanna follow me?
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.620]   "Then you're gonna be hated like I was hated.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.100]   "Don't be surprised."
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.180]   And you kinda go, "Looking for a future and a hope, man.
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.920]   "That's why I got in on Him with Jesus.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.140]   "This is not what I thought would happen, man,
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.100]   "when folks would call me a bigot and intolerant."
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.900]   And we said, "Well, you're not reading your Bible right."
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:30.600]   Philippians 4:13, "If you don't have Jeremiah 29 11 tattooed
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.220]   "on you, Johnny Manziel, you've got Philippians 4 13
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.280]   "tattooed on you."
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.620]   And it tells you that I can do all things
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.620]   through Him who strengthens me.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.780]   Man, that's a great verse.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.420]   What that verse is talking about is because in your lifetime
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.620]   you're not gonna have all welfare and future hope
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.080]   that there's gonna be some calamity.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.620]   You better learn that there's a God
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.540]   who's sovereign over all things and that He's good
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.380]   and that you can trust Him.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.660]   And so this is what it says in Philippians.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.960]   Paul's writing says, "I rejoiced greatly in the Lord
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.500]   "that alas, now you revived your concern for me.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.960]   "Indeed, you were concerned with me before,
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.000]   "but you lacked the opportunity
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.460]   "because everything was cool and good with me.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.180]   "But then when it really got hard,
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.920]   "when things got tough, you guys showed up."
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.180]   And then he says this, he says, "Not that I speak from want
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.580]   "'cause I've learned to be content
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.280]   "in every circumstance I'm in.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.000]   "I know how to get along with humble means
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.800]   "and I also know how to live in prosperity
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.260]   "in any and every circumstance.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.320]   "I have learned," he goes on to say,
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.660]   "the secret of being filled and going hungry,
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.320]   "both of being in abundance and suffering need.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.360]   "In fact, I know my God is so sufficient
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.480]   "to take care of all of my needs."
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.420]   That's verse 19.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.300]   According to his riches and glory in Christ Jesus,
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.300]   "that I can go through anything as He strengthens me."
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.040]   That doesn't mean if you're five foot six,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.840]   if you trust Jesus, you're gonna be able to dunk
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.040]   from the free throw line.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.880]   So quit quoting that verse every time you're trying
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.720]   to get that last set up.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.880]   "I can do all things through Christ."
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.160]   You're gonna get guillotine and it's gonna come on your neck
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.660]   and snap it off if you think that's what that means.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.400]   All right?
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.080]   A verse is telling you if you know Him and walk with Him,
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.280]   that you'll be a person that the world will marvel
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.880]   at your strength and go, "Who are you?"
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.400]   That life isn't unfolding the way you want it
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.880]   to unfold, my God, you're 27 and still a virgin?
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.440]   How are you not neurotic?
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.960]   And you should say, "Well, look, man, I'm not against sex.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.960]   "God, in fact, invented it, He's for it.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.180]   "But I can go through even a series,
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.520]   "a season of chastity and faithfulness
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.280]   "and controlling my flesh for the glory of God.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.360]   "And by the way, I'm not dying.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.040]   "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.280]   People look at you and go, "Man, who are you?"
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.600]   You know, how about this?
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.520]   This idea that comes up where if you give,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.640]   it'll be given to you.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.640]   Now, this is really amazing.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.920]   I wanna spend a little bit of time on this one
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.040]   'cause it's gonna get us to where we wanna go
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.880]   in just a second.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.300]   When the Bible says, "Give, it will be given to you.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.940]   "They will pour into your lap a good measure.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.580]   "Press down, shake, and together, running over.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.700]   "For by your standard of measure,
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.000]   "I will measure back to you in return."
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.920]   That's a verse that certain guys love to motivate you
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.900]   to give, "Hey, give to the porch, man, give to Watermark,
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.320]   "give to this ministry."
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.600]   And so in the manner in which you give,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.440]   it'll be given to you.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.280]   So if you want this thing to blow up, man, let's go.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.200]   You know what's amazing?
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.100]   You know what verse comes before that?
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.680]   It's a verse that helps you understand
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.000]   what Jesus is saying in Matthew 7.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.240]   It's this amazing verse where he says this.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.440]   He says in verse 37, "Do not judge, bro.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.020]   "And you won't be judged.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.560]   "Don't condemn, and you won't be condemned.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.880]   "Pardon, you will be pardoned.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.900]   "For in the manner in which you give,
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.280]   "it will be given to you."
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.320]   Do you see the context there?
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.320]   If you go around telling people
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.080]   about who they are before me
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.640]   and what righteousness looks like,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.040]   then I'm gonna judge you based on how you act before me.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.940]   And it's gonna be pressed down, man,
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.860]   and it's gonna blow up on you,
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.760]   and it's gonna spill out.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.440]   You don't want that kind of judgment, man.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.640]   But if you're merciful and you give mercy to people,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.600]   guess what, you'll be a person
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.840]   that probably received mercy from people
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.680]   you received mercy from.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.400]   He blessed the merciful.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.240]   In fact, he said a couple chapters earlier,
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.800]   "For they will receive mercy."
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.280]   That ain't a verse on giving.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.480]   It's a verse on living.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.720]   Hey, let me just tell you something.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.840]   Never read a Bible verse.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.280]   You read the Bible.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.720]   Father, I pray for my friends tonight.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   As we teach the Bible,
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.840]   that you would protect them from human error.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.080]   I pray that you would allow them to have perceptive hearts,
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.400]   that they would be spiritually appraised,
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.520]   that they would test every single word I say
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.640]   by what your word says.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.160]   The Scripture says, "If we know you,"
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.400]   we don't need anybody to be our teacher,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.880]   "but you will illumine it and teach us correctly."
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.000]   I pray that I'd be faithful.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.920]   If the words of my mouth,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.840]   the meditations of my heart right now
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   would be acceptable in your sight,
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.120]   my Lord, my rock, and my redeemer.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.840]   But help us, Father,
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.440]   to see the truth of what you meant
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.320]   and respond fully to it.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.720]   Amen.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.620]   How about this, man?
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.720]   Here we go, Matthew chapter seven.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.560]   Let's read this.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.840]   The reason I say this is the most misunderstood
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.280]   in all of the world
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.320]   is 'cause if people don't know Philippians 4, 13
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.180]   or Jeremiah 29, 11, let me just tell you something.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.680]   They know Matthew seven.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.000]   And they're gonna drop it on you, man.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.360]   It's gonna show up on Saturday Night Live.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.840]   It's gonna show up when anybody at all
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.680]   enters into a conversation.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.280]   You're gonna hear things like this, man.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.880]   Hey, you ain't the judge of me.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.280]   Lay off, man.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.560]   Hey, who are you to judge me?
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.480]   In fact, what I wanna do is just take a moment.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.060]   And what we did is we went back,
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.800]   when I began on purpose, I do this at times,
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.680]   I jump on social media and I try,
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.040]   well, I don't try, I just make statements
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.900]   that I know people are gonna probably respond to.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.740]   I hope they do.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.120]   I hope they respond to the truth that's there.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.080]   But often they respond to it in a way
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.160]   that they start saying things to me
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.920]   and trying to escalate the conversation
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.640]   and move it away from an honest, civil conversation
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.760]   to name calling.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.400]   And I just try and model on there
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.440]   a little bit of how you deal with people.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.400]   And I hope I teach you a little bit of that tonight.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.480]   Right now, on my blog, wordsfromwags.com
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.320]   is where you can find that.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.920]   I wanna just show you, I wanna walk you through.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.920]   I did this not long ago when Bruce Jenner,
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.780]   now goes by the name Caitlin.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.220]   And I agree with a good friend of mine,
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.500]   John Piper, and people go,
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.700]   "If Bruce was around you, what would you call him?"
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.260]   And I go, "Well, look, names are just kind of random.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.500]   "You assign a name to people, it's kind of a cultural thing."
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.380]   And so I guess I wouldn't wanna keep throwing his face
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.380]   that his name is Bruce, because if he wants to,
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.380]   he can change his name to, I don't know, whatever he wants.
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.900]   If he wants to legally change his name to Caitlin,
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.740]   that's fine.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.660]   Listen, I married Alex.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.300]   Okay, that's what we call her, that's her name.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.940]   Alexandria is what her parents called her.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.540]   But if you heard, "Man, Todd's hanging out with Alex a lot."
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.340]   You know, you might wanna go and check that out
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.860]   and see what that really means.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.980]   But names are just arbitrary, okay?
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.940]   They're just assigned by culture.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.140]   Now, pronouns are not arbitrary.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.680]   Pronouns are assigned by God.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.620]   And so I might call Bruce Caitlin,
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.420]   but I won't call him her,
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.540]   'cause it's not loving.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.300]   But let me ask you guys a question.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.780]   What do you think the world's gonna say
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.020]   when I say it's not loving to call him her?
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.260]   Let me show you.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.340]   It's a little bit of my interchange
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.260]   with different people out there on social media.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.740]   And I went out, and just on the night
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.740]   that he was on the Espes, I put this out there.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.660]   "It's a tragedy and a disservice to celebrate
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.520]   "in his mental illness and foolish
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.020]   "to think highly of yourself for celebrating him,"
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.580]   which is what the world was certainly doing that night.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.700]   I was just saying, "Listen, Bruce is mentally ill."
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.900]   Now, listen, I separate brain illness from mental illness,
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.220]   and I do that very specifically
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.540]   because the Bible says the problem with all of us
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.940]   is that we are wrong-thinking.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.820]   And so the way that we change our lives
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.440]   is we begin to think correctly.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.100]   That's why Jesus, just a few verses before where we are
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.840]   in Matthew chapter seven and chapter six, said,
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.340]   "Hey, bro, here's your problem.
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.260]   "The way you think, the way you perceive reality,
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.740]   "the way you take in information, your eyes are darkened."
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.100]   In other words, you think wrongly,
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.660]   you process and don't see clearly.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.140]   And because you don't see and understand
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.240]   and perceive reality clearly,
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.860]   your perception is the problem.
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.680]   That's why you're living the way that you are.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.540]   David Marvin did a great job with that last week,
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.700]   talking about seeking the wrong things
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.060]   and trying to find life in the wrong things.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:03.620]   And so mental illness is a spiritual problem.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.540]   Brain illness is something different.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.740]   It's a physical problem.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:07.860]   And I'm just gonna warn you,
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.140]   if you are wrong-thinking for a long time,
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.860]   it can lead to physical issues in your life.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.740]   This last weekend, man, if you weren't here at Watermark,
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.580]   I'm gonna tell you, I think it was one of the best Sundays
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.800]   we've ever had at Watermark.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.700]   And the message was amazing.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.180]   And I can say that 'cause I wasn't here.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.060]   In fact, if a pastor should be insecure
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.580]   when the most powerful sermons and messages
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.340]   and events happen at a church when he's not there,
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.940]   I should be the most insecure person
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.980]   on the face of the earth.
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.100]   'Cause this Sunday, I didn't speak,
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.820]   but my buddy JP did, my buddy John Elmore,
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.220]   my buddy Rick Smith, they all talked.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.260]   And they did an amazing job.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.120]   JP talked specifically about pornography.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.140]   And one of the things he said there is,
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.900]   listen, man, if you perceive that you're gonna find life
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.620]   in pornography, it's eventually.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.820]   That mental problem that you think life is found in porn
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.500]   is gonna lead to real physical maladies.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.220]   That's not just the Bible's opinion.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.840]   That is scientific fact today.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.080]   And so I'm gonna tell you,
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.880]   mental illness can lead to brain illness.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.920]   It can lead to physical maladies.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.440]   But Bruce has gotten, you know,
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.200]   Bruce is gonna bring some physical issues on his own life
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.680]   because of his mental issues.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.520]   Now some of you guys are going,
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.640]   "Is this right for Todd to say that?
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.800]   "Isn't this judgmental?"
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.200]   We're gonna learn tonight.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.920]   Now watch this, watch what happens.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.720]   Okay, so I said that.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.600]   I followed it up with another statement,
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.400]   which is when political correctness hurts people,
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.320]   it's not correct.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.960]   It's not loving.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.840]   It's not being magnanimous.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.760]   In fact, it's really professing to be wise.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.580]   You're becoming a fool.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.720]   Okay, and so here's my first friend
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.640]   that pops up to deal with me.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.960]   It's a person named Ryan Lee.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.980]   Later you're gonna see, I saw the female picture there
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.440]   and I responded, "Ma'am," and I corrected that later.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.400]   I wasn't trying to be smart.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.040]   I just saw the girl.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.000]   And Ryan is a name that can go both ways.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.040]   And so I thought it was a girl.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.440]   I corrected it, but watch this.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.880]   Ryan said, "Hey, man, I don't understand her illness
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.840]   "and what she's going through, so I don't judge, man.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.000]   "I just love."
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.600]   Now watch, who's gonna say this to me?
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.840]   "Hey, Todd, leave the judging to God.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.400]   "Oh, this is a God believer.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   "This is a theist that's now gonna tell me."
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.960]   And so I said, "Hey, Ryan, this might help you.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.440]   "What does the Bible mean when it says,
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.800]   "judge not, lest you be judged?"
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.000]   Now here's the great news.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.840]   There's six minutes on this
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.280]   that you can go to realtruthrealquick.com and check it out.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.760]   Where I just said, "Hey, check this out."
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.400]   So he goes and he checks it out.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.740]   And then he responds by saying,
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.040]   "Oh, hey, thank you for the spiritual lesson.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.540]   "Here's yours."
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.560]   Now what I like about this
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.560]   is that the brother sent me a passage, not a verse.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.400]   Watch this.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.900]   "Hey, love your enemies, do good,
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.440]   "and lend, hoping for nothing again,
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.920]   "and your reward will be great.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.420]   "He should be highest of the children of the highest,
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.120]   "for he is kind unto the thankful and to the evil.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.720]   "Be therefore merciful, as your Father is merciful."
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.040]   I'm down with that.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.160]   Judge not, and you won't be judged, man.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.740]   Condemn not, you won't be condemned.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.520]   Forgiven, you shall be forgiven.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.880]   And we know this verse, right?
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.640]   Have you ever read that verse before?
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.400]   Say yes, unless you just walked in here.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.760]   I don't think you did.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.600]   You read that.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.420]   Now listen, I love this,
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.480]   'cause what he's saying is, he wants me to read what?
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.600]   He wants me to read, "Judge not, lest you be judged."
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.220]   What do we need to read?
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.920]   Well, he's telling me to be kind and merciful.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.120]   And so, so here's my response, man.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.760]   I go, "Hey, man, bro."
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.480]   But let me just remind you,
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.880]   that part of kindness is open rebuke.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.440]   And I'm not supposed to conceal love,
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.720]   I'm supposed to come forward with it.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.760]   In fact, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.920]   "but deceitful are the kisses of an enemy."
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.920]   Oh, so you're saying my script is false.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.320]   No, I didn't say that.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.440]   I'm just telling you, if you tattoo Philippians 4.13,
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.960]   you try and do 100 reps of 245, bro,
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.520]   you're going to hurt yourself.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.560]   That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.560]   Even worse, if you are God's agent of truth
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.200]   and hope and light, and you misunderstand what he says,
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.020]   the world is gonna get dark and deceived.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.680]   He said, "I can go back and forth with you all day long,
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.880]   "man, I can see you're not open to other point of view."
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.840]   And that's why I said, "No, ma'am, I let her correct this
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.080]   "when he let me know he wasn't a man,
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.640]   "he's the guy in the picture."
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.180]   I said, "Luke 6 is completely true,
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.580]   "but thinking love means supporting someone's error
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.200]   "is not loving or true."
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.560]   Now watch this, follow with me.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.760]   "Oh my God," says Aida.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.040]   "Because of stupid people like this fool,
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.680]   "everyone thinks we are Christians
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.360]   "and some crazy ass fanatics."
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.080]   All right, so I said, "Hey, Aida,
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.920]   "can you share with me as a fellow follower of Christ
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.120]   "by using God's word where anything I said was crazy ass?
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.660]   "'Cause I'd love to know."
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.960]   All right, and so she responds.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.800]   Actually, another person I've interacted with before
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.520]   on Twitter, Jones Pants is what they call themselves.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.000]   Says, "Her name is Caitlin,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.600]   "and it's really dangerous for trans people
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.480]   "when people like you say that supporting us
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.680]   "is what hurts us."
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.220]   I go, "Hey, Joan, hello again.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.920]   "I wanna love people, not support them."
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.880]   Did you catch that?
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.040]   I wanna love people.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.120]   Hey, you guys ever heard this?
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.680]   Friends don't let friends...
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.840]   Ah!
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.360]   It's a dangerous town if only a few of you guys know that.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.200]   Right?
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.120]   I don't know, friends just party all night
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.120]   and get on 75 and 90, man, I don't know.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.560]   Let me ask you again for my sake.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.880]   I got kids that are driving.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.440]   Friends don't let friends chop their penis off
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.640]   because they think they're a girl.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.480]   They don't.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.640]   All right?
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:14.720]   Now listen, they do what they can,
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.120]   and they go, "I wanna support you."
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.720]   But that's not supporting you, man.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.360]   That's not like, "Bro, all right, I'm down with that.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.200]   "Let's go."
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.680]   Now look, you wanna be...
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:33.160]   You gotta understand that a lot of tenor
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.400]   just has gotta come because there's something
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.880]   really wrong with the mind that thinks
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.840]   that's what it's gotta do to find life.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.000]   But are you tracking with me?
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.920]   Now watch, you know, I just go,
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.880]   "Look, man, when political correctness hurts people,
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.080]   "it is not correct, it is not loving,
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.920]   "it's not magnanimous."
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.760]   I repeat that.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.800]   And so, hey, transphobia is the mental illness,
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.560]   which is really what exactly has happened in our society.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.440]   People that used to study the human mind
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.520]   said that homosexuality and transgender dysphoria
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.600]   was the mental illness, and guess what?
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.960]   It's completely switched now.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.920]   And now it's people who think that telling boys
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.480]   they're boys and girls they're girls
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.240]   without letting them think it through
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.760]   are the people who are mentally ill.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.320]   That's what's happening in our world today,
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.960]   and the reason it's happening is because you all
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.480]   misunderstand Matthew 7, and you don't wanna be a hater.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.560]   And we're gonna clear that up tonight,
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.600]   and we're gonna send out of this room
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.960]   3,000 people to get it right,
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.760]   and another 1,000 in Fort Worth,
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.240]   and I hope you share this message with other people, man.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.960]   And I just say to 'em, I understand it's your position.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.400]   As we discuss the wisdom of our different takes,
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.640]   let's do it well and without calling it hate.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.280]   Another person shows up, Tokyo David,
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.440]   and just says, "Hey, man, to me,
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.680]   "transphobia and ignorance is a mental illness
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.520]   "and a tragedy.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.600]   "You get help."
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.440]   And I say, "Hey, Tokyo David,
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.200]   "let's try and help each other, bro.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.080]   "If something is true,
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.440]   "no amount of scrutiny will affect it,
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.880]   "so let's talk about our different ideas
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.440]   "and what's the merit of them."
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.360]   Ina comes back in and say, "Calling someone mentally ill
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.800]   "just because they're different is wrong."
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.960]   Agreed, I say.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.040]   But we are talking about more than being different.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.480]   We're talking about contradicting what is real
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.520]   and what is true.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.480]   You know what's amazing?
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.200]   Some of you guys are tracking, and you're kinda,
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.280]   wow, can you really say that?
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.720]   That someone's a boy because of their DNA
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.320]   and because of their God-assigned gender?
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.160]   Can you say that?
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.680]   It's amazing where we've gotten.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.000]   Because people are no longer making judgments
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.080]   that God says, "Hey, if you judge this wrongly,
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.240]   "if you get on the broad road,
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.280]   "it's gonna lead to destruction.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.320]   "Truth is narrow.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.920]   "I'm gonna teach you that tonight."
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.400]   It's always been narrow,
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.280]   and God wants people who love people to speak up.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.000]   So watch this, man.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.600]   Somebody says something to me.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.120]   Actually, it was Jellybean897.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.760]   They later removed, Jellybean got rid of their post.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.720]   But what they basically said is I was bullying,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.160]   and I said, "Hey, bro, I'm not gonna support
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.080]   "anti-gay bullying, but I'm gonna tell you,
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.680]   "not loving children with grace and truth,
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.800]   "that's today's problem.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.120]   "That's child abuse."
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.680]   When you let a six-year-old say,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.920]   "Hey, I think I'm presenting as a girl
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.760]   "even though I'm a boy.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.560]   "I think I'm a boy even though I'm a girl."
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.800]   That's child abuse to support that.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.600]   Do you all understand that?
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:14.160]   That's parental sickness when a six-year-old can tell you
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.400]   that there's something other than
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.080]   thousands of years of human history have confirmed,
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.700]   and that, by the way, science has confirmed over time
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.840]   changing their gender because they think
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.080]   they might be a different gender
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.640]   is not going to take care of their mental illness.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.520]   And probably at six, they're not mentally ill.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.160]   They're just learning.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.960]   Man, I can remember when I was five-year-olds,
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.840]   Karen Hollenbeck was my best friend.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.960]   I used to play dolls over at Karen Hollenbeck's house
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.960]   all the time.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.720]   I loved it.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.120]   She was cute, she was fun, she was also fast.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.920]   And I can remember sometimes being up in a room
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.600]   playing with dolls.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.960]   I don't know if I grabbed Ken or Barbie.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.960]   All I knew was hanging out with my buddy.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.200]   Can you imagine if I went home and go,
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.160]   "Hey, I think I like Barbie."
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.940]   And somebody, because I was five and had a friend,
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.740]   would have said, "Well, chase that."
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.680]   Hey, what Joan's Pants comes back and says
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.960]   is to me basically this,
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.880]   and you can see the other interactions I have with Blair.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.960]   Tolerance doesn't mean every opinion is equally true.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.320]   That's a wrong opinion of tolerance.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.340]   I'm gonna give this to you in a minute.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.400]   Saying that it hurts trans people to be supported,
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.960]   Joan lets me know, that's what's hateful.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.080]   And I just respond, I support their right to choose.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.880]   I will defend their right to choose.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.420]   And against any hate that comes against them
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.900]   for choosing that, but I can't support their choice is wise.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.000]   All right, man, hey, I'm gonna tell you all day long,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.980]   you're free to choose.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.400]   That's not my idea, that's God's.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.100]   I'm not gonna sit there and tell you
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.560]   that your choice is gonna lead to life.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.700]   And if you wanna call me a hater because I say that,
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.380]   I'm gonna be the one that after you call me a hater
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.800]   for a lot of years, you're probably gonna come back
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.580]   and say, "Hey, man, you were the one person that loved me.
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.740]   "Everybody else just wanted to get on the bandwagon
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.040]   "and follow me down this road to destruction.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.260]   "But you loved me and I hated you for it."
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.580]   I think every single one of you guys
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.700]   is gonna say that one day to God.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.180]   I think your knees gonna bow before him.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.740]   Whether you ever do it on this earth or not,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.540]   you're gonna bow before him and say, "God, you loved me.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.460]   "You gave me your word, you protected it,
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.020]   "you sovereignly made it the most popular
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.300]   "and read and distributed book in the history of the world.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.580]   "You had one man that came
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.880]   "that all of human history pivoted on.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.520]   "That man died on the cross for my sins.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.180]   "I've heard the story.
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.220]   "Even if I didn't hear the story,
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.380]   "I saw your beauty in order and design and creation.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.980]   "And you gave me a conscience.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.620]   "And so I knew that what I did was wrong
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.220]   "and I never honored my conscience
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.580]   "or honored you in creation.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.860]   "And I suppressed the truth and unrighteousness,
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.940]   "but thank you for the conscience that you gave me
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.700]   "that I spit on and destroyed my life.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.940]   "Thank you.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.900]   "You are God and you are king and I despised you.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.140]   "But I acknowledge you now as Lord."
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.340]   That is gonna happen one day.
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.540]   And what God says is if you know he's that now,
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.380]   he expects you to love other people.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.820]   You guys can go and look at that blog post.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.380]   I'm not gonna spend any more time reading the rest of that
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.180]   'cause there's better words that I'm gonna show you.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.380]   I'm gonna teach them to you correctly.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.100]   So what's going on here in Matthew 7?
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.100]   Let's read the verses I'm assigned to teach you tonight.
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:17.940]   Here they come.
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.900]   "Do not judge that you won't be judged.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.720]   "For the way that you judge, you will be judged.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.680]   "And by your standard of measure will be measured to you.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.500]   "Why do you look at the speck that's in your brother's eye
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.340]   "but do not notice the log that's in your own eye?
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.300]   "How can you say to your brother,
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.640]   "let me take the speck out of your eye?
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.560]   "Behold, the log is in your own eye.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.740]   "You hypocrite, first take the log out of your eye
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.420]   "and then you will see clearly to take the speck
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.140]   "out of your brother's eye.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.460]   "Don't give what's holy to dogs.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.820]   "Don't throw your pearls before swine
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.860]   "or they will trample them under their feet
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.540]   "and turn and tear you to pieces."
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.940]   Now listen, here's what you need to know.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.060]   When you read the Bible, it's context, context, context.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.260]   Let the Bible interpret itself.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.700]   What you need to know is that God
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.820]   is not the author of confusion.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:04.100]   And so you wanna listen to what he says.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.260]   Don't ever change your life
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.380]   or don't ever read a Bible verse.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:12.060]   Now look, there's some Bible verses if you read it.
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.700]   All right, you're gonna find out
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.500]   that what that verse means in its most literal sense
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.100]   presented by itself is supported by the larger statement.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.420]   And so you might get away with it
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.540]   if the only Bible verse you ever read is John 14, six,
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.220]   that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.260]   and no one comes to the Father except by him.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.260]   You might get away with Acts 4, 12,
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.740]   which says there's no other name under heaven
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.160]   by which men must be saved except the name Lord Jesus.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.900]   You might get away with John 3, 16.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.100]   For God so loved the world
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.180]   that he gave his only begotten son
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.580]   that whosoever believes in him should not perish
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.020]   but have eternal life.
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.460]   There's a few verses that you're gonna find out
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.980]   that is said again and again and again and again
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:47.820]   and again in the story,
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.020]   but it's still a good thing to tell you,
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.500]   context, context, context.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.100]   Don't ever read a Bible verse, read a Bible passage.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:58.300]   Because most of the time it's gonna really jack you up.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.660]   And this is one.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.300]   What was the very first thing that I got hit with
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.140]   when I stepped out there
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.900]   and tried to say some things to our world?
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.640]   Hey, by the way, I think Bruce Jenner or Caitlyn
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.620]   is very courageous.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.120]   One of the things that he did,
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.360]   I do think he's courageous,
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.360]   but not for the reason he got an SB.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.640]   He's courageous because he said,
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.340]   this is where I'm struggling.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.440]   His problem was that his church
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.740]   convinced him it wasn't a struggle.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:33.000]   His church said, bro, man, let's go.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.560]   It was Hozier's church.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.480]   Take me to church, let's go.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.640]   I will worship like a dog.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.800]   Hey, that's what happened
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.600]   is that Bruce Jenner was courageous.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.880]   He said, hey, I'm starting to think,
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.200]   I know I won the gold medal in '76 in Montreal
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.040]   as the men's decathlete.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.360]   I was the greatest athlete on the world,
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.320]   but because of a lot of other issues,
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.060]   I'm having some real gender dysphoria.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.320]   Now listen, in '76, Bruce Jenner was surrounded by a culture
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.880]   that said, Bruce, that's not healthy.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.800]   Now, unfortunately, he didn't run into the loving people
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.640]   that really began to help him work through some of that.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.840]   What he did is he started running with the Kardashians
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.040]   and others who were like, hey,
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.000]   whatever's gonna work out there, let's make it work.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.360]   But I wanna tell you something, man.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.320]   If you're here struggling, we're not gonna laugh at you
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.240]   because you've got gender dysphoria.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.480]   I hope you don't laugh at me that I am polyamorous.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.320]   And that in my heart, I'm never satisfied
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.220]   with just one beautiful woman who's given me six children.
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.300]   I hope you don't mock me that when I heard
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.480]   about Exotica coming to Dallas, I had two thoughts.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.280]   One, God bless those 15,000 estimated people
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.640]   that wanna go down there and find life,
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.480]   and maybe I can go and minister to them
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.360]   and get to voyeuristically see some stuff
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.440]   that I haven't seen in a long time
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.540]   that I still really crave.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.360]   And I hope you don't make fun of me for that.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.800]   'Cause I'm broken, man, my sexuality is all jacked up.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.880]   But I don't need you to tell me, it's all right, Todd.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.120]   You go get you some Jenna Jameson, man, it's all right, Todd.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.880]   You go get you some of that, man.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.360]   That one especially, I mean, maybe you don't wanna go
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.480]   and be with her really, but you can fantasize that you are.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.980]   Pornography's a sin, doesn't hurt anybody, really.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.400]   You need to read up.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.440]   And so, man, I hope you don't judge me,
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.040]   'cause I'm screwed up, in the sense that you're gonna say,
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.240]   I don't want anything to do with a guy like you,
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.200]   and God could never love a guy like you,
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.320]   'cause I'm jacked up.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.880]   This morning I shared that with the staff.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.840]   I just told them, I said, hey, we were singing the song,
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.640]   Lord, I Need You, and there's a line in there
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.040]   that just hit me today like never before,
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.440]   and that line is, holiness is Christ in me.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.320]   And you know what's so funny?
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.400]   I mean, I know that's true, but what's so funny
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.680]   is that I sometimes think holiness is Todd Wagner
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.120]   getting it after, man, being a pastor now for 30 years,
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.600]   preaching the word, knowing it, memorizing a lot of passages,
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.560]   not just verses.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.720]   Holiness is the way I live.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.000]   I've loved my wife, been faithful for now a quarter century.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.560]   I've raised my kids to love God.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.280]   Holiness is me getting it done for Jesus.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.820]   That is crazy, unbiblical, and error.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.440]   There is nothing good in me.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.980]   My Bible says, you know what, Todd?
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.800]   Your flesh is never going to be anything other than cursed,
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.600]   and so I'm not trying to have you curb your flesh.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.040]   You need to continually crucify your flesh,
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.520]   and the life which you now live in the flesh,
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.080]   you live by faith in the Son of God who loved you
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.600]   and gave himself up for you.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.620]   You must decrease, and he must increase.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.360]   Do you know where I get screwed up?
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.560]   The same way Bruce Jenner gets screwed up
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.880]   is when I start to follow what my flesh thinks and feels.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.540]   Feelings are real, they're just not reliable.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.760]   Truth is reliable.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.300]   Follow truth.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.680]   Jesus is truth.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.560]   Follow him.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.320]   Hey man, you might be hearing, you're really whacked out.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.480]   I don't know what your whacked out is.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.160]   I can tell you what mine is,
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.040]   and I hope it doesn't make you
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.760]   not want to worship God with me.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:19.800]   But I don't care if you're a guy and you want to be a girl.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.160]   If you're a girl and want to be with a girl,
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.960]   or a guy, want to be with a guy.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.800]   I don't care if you're a girl
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.280]   and want to find your meaning through guys.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.600]   I don't care if you're a girl
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.880]   and you cut babies out of you when they're there
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.840]   'cause they're inconvenient.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.360]   You're embarrassed by what you've done.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.320]   I mean, I do care 'cause I love you.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   And I've chased some of those nasty roads
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.760]   of rebellion myself, and every time I know where they lead,
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.360]   and I'm just here to tell you there's a better way.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.840]   And I'm not judging you like God can never judge you.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.120]   That's what the wrong guys did that Jesus is rebuking here.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.920]   See, here's what's going on in Matthew.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.160]   Jesus is saying you want to be blessed,
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.560]   here's how you're blessed, you're poor in spirit.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.640]   The Pharisees made a fundamental flaw
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.200]   and had a fundamental problem.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.720]   They judged themselves wrongly,
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.760]   they judged others wrongly, and they judged God wrongly.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.780]   And what Jesus is saying here in the context is this.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.200]   Go back chapter and a half to Matthew 5, verse 20.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.040]   Hey, unless your righteousness is greater than the Pharisees,
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.600]   the guys that their full-time job is to be righteous
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.500]   and do righteous things, you're not gonna get into heaven.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.580]   And you're like, what the, are you kidding me?
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.220]   Unless I'm more righteous than Mother Teresa
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.780]   and Billy Graham's offspring?
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:37.460]   If that wasn't enough, then we go to verse 48 of Matthew 5
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.380]   where he's continuing the idea.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.220]   He says, hey, here's the deal.
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.060]   Be perfect like your heavenly Father is perfect.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.900]   Some of you guys have read that verse
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.860]   and you're trying to be perfect.
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.980]   Don't read a Bible verse.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.740]   Jesus isn't telling you to be perfect
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.380]   and get yourself in religious order.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.000]   He's saying this, hey, bro, the standard is perfection.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.040]   You wanna know how to get to heaven?
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.040]   Be perfect.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.360]   And it should make you go, I screwed that one up
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.620]   at like, you know, two hours.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:03.920]   And if you wanna wait 'til I was old enough
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.560]   to be accountable, I screwed that up in two seconds
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.520]   after I was accountable.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.060]   I'm not perfect.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.280]   What do I do?
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.800]   And Jesus says, what you should do is follow me.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.900]   Trust in me.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.680]   Your lack of perfection brings about an imperfect world.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.640]   Your lack of perfection destroys relationships.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.260]   Your lack of perfection makes you sad, depressed,
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.900]   discouraged, at war with each other.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.100]   And I'm here to make that right, man.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.220]   Let me bring peace.
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.440]   Let's start with you individually
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.700]   and then we'll get a collective group of you
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.040]   and then we'll just expand this thing
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.660]   and eventually I'll work this whole thing out.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:49.140]   But a little bit later, he comes to these guys
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.100]   who are running this show and he says,
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.320]   hey man, by the way, you guys,
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.760]   you quit judging other people.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.540]   You quit telling them what they've gotta do
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.560]   to be okay with me because here's the problem.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.640]   You judge yourself wrong.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.960]   You think you're righteous.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.200]   You're not perfect.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.120]   You're not righteous.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.040]   And here's your problem.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.920]   You think you're so good that other people,
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.600]   you judge wrongly, that there's no way
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.440]   they'll be good enough.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.320]   And so you heap burdens on them, more burdens,
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.600]   and all they become is twice the sons of hell that you are.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.680]   And you know why you do that?
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.620]   Because you judge me wrongly.
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.200]   You think that I'm satisfied with the deeds of man
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.880]   and you don't know that to me,
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.060]   your righteous deeds are like filthy rags.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.540]   So I don't care how long you've been a virgin.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.020]   I don't care how much money you've given.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.460]   You're not perfect.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.420]   I'm perfect.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.180]   I don't merge with imperfect.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.020]   I have no fellowship with darkness.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.140]   You need to be born again.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.620]   And bro, you can't even born yourself.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:41.100]   And so you better appeal to something that isn't like you.
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.660]   Start with me, God, creator of heavens and earth.
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.100]   That's your Bible, people.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.360]   And so what he's saying is, here's your deal, man.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.640]   Quit telling people what will get them into heaven.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.560]   What gets them into heaven is that they are poor in spirit.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.680]   You don't judge yourself correctly.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.040]   What Jesus is talking about right here
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.780]   is that don't you assign a human standard
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:10.160]   to a perfect God's righteousness.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.520]   You wanna help people get reconciled with me?
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.360]   Then why don't you get the log out of your eye?
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.040]   I'd love for you to help people,
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.680]   but you can't see to get the speck out of their eye.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.640]   And so Jesus told all kinds of stories throughout the Bible.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.000]   One of them he told in Luke 18,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.320]   where there's these two guys and they come
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:34.320]   and one of them is a tax gatherer, a non-Jew.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.280]   And he didn't even go near the temple.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.200]   He just falls in his face and he beats his chest
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.040]   and he rips his clothes.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.360]   He says, "Oh God, have mercy on me, a sinner."
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.840]   And then next to him is a Pharisee, a Jew,
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.680]   adorned in righteousness, follower of the law,
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.000]   keeper of the Sabbath.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.160]   And he looks at the despicable guy that's over there
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.920]   and he says, "I'm glad I'm not like that guy."
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.960]   And Jesus is going, "Oh my God,
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.600]   "bro, you better start to judge yourself rightly.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.400]   "That guy, that's the guy I accept.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.860]   "I don't want your dead works.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.440]   "You think human performance is enough for my perfection?"
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.680]   See, every single person in this room
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.280]   that is not running to God and embracing him
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.200]   has one of two problems.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.400]   They either have too high a view of themself
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.880]   or too low a view of God.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:24.280]   And usually when you have too high a view of yourself, man,
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.320]   when you're looking down on other people,
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.160]   you can never look up to see the judgment
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:28.980]   that's coming at you.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.480]   And Jesus is setting this record straight right here.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.200]   And he's just telling them flat out, man, here's the deal.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.060]   Listen to what Jesus said, "Blessed are the poor.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.040]   "Blessed are those who mourn because they're poor.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.620]   "Blessed are the meek and are gentle
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.880]   "because they know that apart from God's grace
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.740]   "they're not gonna get anything.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.360]   "Blessed are those that hunger and thirst for righteousness
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.240]   "because they know they don't have it on them themselves."
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.480]   If you think you're righteous
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.620]   because you go to Watermark, you're a pastor at Watermark,
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.400]   you give to Watermark, you haven't had sex
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.780]   with anybody but your wife, oh man.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:03.320]   If you think you're better than people
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.020]   that are gonna go to Exotica this weekend
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:09.400]   because you think you're not going, pleases me, Todd,
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.020]   every time you look at a woman with lust in your heart,
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.580]   you've committed adultery, man.
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:20.800]   Now, temptation is not sin, but going back over it is sin.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.340]   I committed adultery, I am sure, sometime this week.
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.920]   And I should add right here,
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.280]   please take my entire sermon in context
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.240]   and don't listen to two seconds, right?
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.880]   I know JP goes, "Mark that, we're gonna use that."
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:41.280]   I'll be pastor here in no time,
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.680]   that's what he's thinking right now.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.040]   You probably ought to be.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.660]   You probably ought to be, bro.
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.480]   Let me just tell you guys,
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.580]   there's a difference between being judgmental,
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:57.800]   which is I'm better than you,
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.000]   there's no way that God could ever love you,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.160]   and making judgments.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.360]   Can I just say that to you one more time?
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.460]   There's a difference between being judgmental,
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.900]   which is this is what it takes for you
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.060]   to make yourself right with God,
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.360]   you better be as good as me, and that is detestable.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.520]   Can I just tell you something, man?
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.720]   You know, we do, oh, I think it was also in 2006,
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.120]   I gave a message called
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.480]   Homosexuality and Same-Sex Marriage,
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.840]   an apology, an answer, and an assignment.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:32.020]   And I just apologized to the homosexual community,
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.180]   and just, can I tell you something, man?
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.760]   We got divorces rampant in our churches,
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.280]   we have not honored marriage here for a long time.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.620]   And hopefully not at Watermark,
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.060]   but the church, you know, the church has endorsed
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.640]   this no-fault divorce idea,
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.140]   and we're talking about the sanctity of marriage,
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.560]   we don't protect marriage,
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.840]   we're just telling you you can't have it.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.580]   And by the way, it's not right,
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.860]   because we're screwing up marriage,
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.620]   that we should let you screw up marriage,
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.060]   but we can't tell you that you're the only ones
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.300]   that screw up marriage, but we screw it up constantly.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.860]   Right, if I not right now asked you guys
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.960]   to raise your hand, how many of you guys
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.780]   are the product of a broken home,
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.960]   a bunch of your hands would go up,
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.440]   and if I said, how many of you guys,
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.940]   you're broken home, it's because you had two mommies,
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:08.780]   or two daddies?
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:15.580]   Probably, at this day and age, maybe one or two,
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.620]   because not many were when you were kids.
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:23.120]   But we've been stomping all over marriage for a long time,
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:23.960]   and we've been telling people,
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.780]   God won't love you if you think gay marriage is good.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.580]   Now by the way, God loves you,
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:28.700]   he demonstrates his love for you,
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.160]   and that while you still think gay marriage,
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.940]   or homosexuality, or transgender issues,
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.600]   or pornography, or lustful thoughts,
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.100]   or whatever it is that's not perfect,
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.220]   he's loved you for a long time, man.
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.420]   He demonstrates his love for you,
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.900]   and that while you're yet sinners, he died for you.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:51.820]   But it's not loving for him just to go,
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.380]   all right, well go ahead, 'cause he knows
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.700]   if you sow to the flesh, you're gonna reap destruction.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:02.300]   And friends, don't let friends drive to destruction.
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:06.300]   And so what Jesus is saying right here,
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.660]   man, you guys better watch yourself.
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:08.700]   Man, you're in a position of power,
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.220]   you're telling people a lot about me.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.180]   If you start telling people they're gonna be measured
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.260]   by the way that they perform,
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.320]   I'm gonna measure you by the way you perform,
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.500]   and it's not gonna go well with you.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.360]   And so he's telling them, repent.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.540]   Let me tell you something,
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.540]   Jesus never said to not make judgments.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.500]   If you keep reading in Matthew 7,
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.300]   he's gonna say, you're gonna know a kind of tree
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.340]   by guess what?
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.300]   A judgment.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.500]   How do you know it's a banana tree?
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.620]   It has, go ahead, it's okay.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:45.420]   It has a banana.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.040]   How do you know it's a boy?
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:48:03.800]   Smart crowd.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.200]   And when you stop making those kind of judgments, man,
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.820]   you just kind of go, are you serious?
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.280]   We are some seriously jacked up people.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.920]   Professing to be wise, we become really, really foolish.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.800]   And we call ourselves magnanimous,
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.920]   and we tell somebody they're courageous
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.920]   because they go to a peach and say it's a banana.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:31.360]   I go, that's just not healthy.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.160]   Let me ask you guys a question.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:42.800]   If you say that a dog's tail is a leg,
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.560]   how many legs does a dog have?
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.720]   Abraham Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln asked that question.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.720]   It's the Abraham Lincoln quote.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.840]   He says, hey man, if you call a dog's tail a leg,
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.440]   how many legs does a dog have?
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.800]   He says that it's four.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.360]   You're calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.480]   Do you know what's happening today, people?
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.720]   Can I just tell you something?
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.640]   What's happening is that people are starting
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.640]   to call a tail a leg.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.200]   And we're going, we've been screwed up for a long time.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.040]   Fido's got five legs.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.560]   We're not screwed up.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.160]   We're screwed up when we start to call a tail a leg.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.360]   It's not, and what Jesus is saying is crazy.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.680]   Can I just show you guys something?
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.120]   Watch this.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.480]   I'm gonna read to you from Ephesians chapter four.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.720]   Just listen to this, okay?
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.200]   I mean, this is all through your Bible.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.680]   Ephesians chapter four, verse 11.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.360]   Hey, God gave some as apostles, people that are sent forth,
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.880]   some as prophets, those are fourth tellers,
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.600]   or maybe even foretellers.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.920]   Some as evangelists, some as pastors, some as teachers.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.400]   Thank God he gave us pastors and teachers.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.280]   You know what's amazing?
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.680]   Guess who they're putting on news today?
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.120]   They're putting guys on TV with robes.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.080]   They look like pastors, they look like teachers,
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.680]   and they're going, that's marriage.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.280]   That's loving to accept them
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.160]   and telling them what they're doing
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.960]   is not gonna screw them up, and it's screwing them up.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.960]   And it's screwing you up.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.960]   And if you're a pastor, is this mind,
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.680]   yeah, I mean, does somebody agree,
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.880]   or is it scary to go, I think he's right, but I.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.400]   I think he's right, but man,
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.160]   I'm starting to think dogs have five legs.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.440]   Dogs don't have five legs.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.560]   I mean, there might be one at the state fair next year
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.400]   that has five legs.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.040]   Lay down your four tickets and go see it.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.640]   But they don't generally have five legs.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.880]   They've got four.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.520]   And so God sends people forth.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.360]   Who does he send forth?
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.920]   He sends forth people that know him,
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.120]   and so they know truth, and they love people.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.400]   And friends don't let friends live dissipated,
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:46.200]   disillusioned, drunken lives.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.560]   Do you know what my friend who said,
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.040]   Todd, here's some scripture for you.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.280]   Do you know what it keeps saying
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.680]   if you keep reading where they had me?
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.840]   It says when the blind lead the blind,
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.360]   they both fall into a pit.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:00.960]   Can I tell you what's happening in America?
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.560]   We've got blind leaders.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.960]   And here's what else is happening in America.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.480]   The same thing that happened in Nazi Germany.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.140]   I want you guys to listen to me very carefully.
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:12.760]   There's a thing called the spiral of silence,
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.920]   and it's happening because you misunderstand
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.240]   because you've been beaten down with Matthew 7.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.760]   I want you to see how I responded to Matthew 7.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.440]   We put together a resource for you,
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.960]   and we can go, hey, here's what it means
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.840]   in Matthew chapter 7.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.600]   Now, you can either send me this message,
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.360]   or you can send it to six or seven minutes there
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.440]   in Real Truth, Real Quick,
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.760]   and you go, this is what it really means.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.360]   I just unpack it for him really quickly right there
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.080]   so that you stop being pushed into silence.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.120]   There's a thing that Elizabeth Noelle Newman,
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.800]   who was a Nazi journalist,
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.480]   she wrote for a Nazi paper back in the 1940s in Germany,
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.520]   and she noticed that there was a pattern in humankind,
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.240]   and Hitler tapped into it,
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.060]   and it's when a tiny majority of the population
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.760]   control the conversation,
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.740]   and what happens is because people by nature
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.760]   are reluctant to go against what they perceive
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.840]   to be the tide of public opinion,
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.960]   and they're frightened,
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.880]   the majority that knows that dogs have four legs go,
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.280]   well, no one else is saying that there's just four legs.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.320]   Everybody's saying it's five.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.760]   I don't wanna be the guy who gets it wrong.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.800]   I don't wanna be the guy who goes, no, there's four,
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.320]   and so they stop, and they go, well, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:17.200]   When everybody in the room goes, that's a tale,
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.320]   but because influential, funny people
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:25.100]   like John Stewart, Barack Obama,
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:31.700]   pastors who are no pastors start to say some things,
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.020]   you're like, what?
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.140]   I don't know what to do.
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.100]   You know what's so funny is in 2006,
[00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.200]   I was watching Bill Maher.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.100]   You guys know Bill Maher, right?
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.060]   Politically incorrect.
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:42.660]   It was right after Jeffrey Dahmer died.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.660]   You guys know, raise your hand
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.540]   if you know who Jeffrey Dahmer is
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.820]   so I don't have to waste any time.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:49.460]   Okay, Jeffrey Dahmer was a famous serial killer.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.240]   I ask that 'cause I know a lot of you guys don't know.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:54.040]   He was a famous serial killer in the early 2000s.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.440]   He started when he was a kid by just killing cats
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.500]   and torturing animals, and it progressed
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.440]   to where he needed to torture children,
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.160]   and then he didn't just torture them.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:09.780]   He killed 'em, and he preserved 'em, and he ate 'em.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.200]   Okay, and this is what Bill Maher did.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.380]   He actually said this.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.880]   He goes, he did a eulogy for Jeffrey Dahmer.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.260]   He goes, we're here today to honor Jeffrey.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:27.220]   You know, Jeffrey was known to rape and eat his friends,
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.840]   but who am I to judge?
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.360]   And then his little bit continued.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.620]   Bill Maher laughed at himself.
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.780]   Everybody else laughed.
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:39.620]   Guess what?
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.880]   I don't know, man.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:46.060]   I don't know how long this is gonna be funny.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.760]   Right, I mean, after all, who are you to judge?
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:53.500]   Now, you guys, Michael, that is so absurd.
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.860]   Okay, well, just roll back about 15 years
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.100]   and check out what we thought was absurd then.
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:02.580]   It had something to do with bananas.
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:07.380]   And I'm just telling you, it's because people
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.180]   who know the truth as teachers aren't speaking up.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.660]   And it says here in Ephesians, you know,
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:16.540]   in verse 12, right after that, it says that the reason
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.100]   that these people are there is to equip the saints.
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:18.940]   That's what we're doing tonight.
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.140]   That's why I'm so glad you guys are here.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:23.140]   About 3,000 of you, about 1,000 of you in Fort Worth, I hope.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.820]   You're gonna get it right,
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.480]   and you're gonna change the world.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.060]   Until we all attain the unity of the faith
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.580]   and the knowledge of the Son of God to mature men,
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:36.780]   men to the measure of the stature which belongs
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:40.060]   to the fullness of the kindness that is God.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.860]   His name is Jesus, and as a result,
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:47.860]   we're no longer going to be children tossed here and there
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:51.020]   by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine,
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:53.740]   by the trickery of men, by the craftiness
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.660]   and deceitful scheming.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:55:00.240]   You all are being lied to, and it's killing your generation.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:06.860]   And I'm telling you that children have no judgment.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:11.180]   And if you teach them that that's normal,
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.460]   they'll grow up thinking it's normal.
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.980]   Children don't know it's a light socket.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.020]   They think it's just a hole to play with.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.340]   They don't know it's not a Tootsie Roll
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:20.780]   laying in the front yard.
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.660]   I've had 'em.
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:26.260]   And they go, "Look, Hershey's just littered stuff
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:27.540]   "all over our front yard."
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.380]   You know?
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.220]   No!
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:37.340]   Was that being judgmental when I dove over landmines
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:39.300]   to keep them from eating one?
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:43.580]   No, it was courageous is what it was.
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:45.900]   You're not a courageous parent when your kid goes,
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.300]   "I don't know, world."
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:51.420]   Well, let's call it a Tootsie Roll.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:59.740]   So here's what I wanna do.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.340]   I'll just give you some application, okay?
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.500]   There's so much more I could do,
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.180]   but you see what the passage is saying?
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.780]   It's telling you, man, listen.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:08.780]   In Matthew 7, it's saying, "Don't be somebody
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.580]   "who thinks that they are right with God
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.820]   "because they do a few things that other people aren't doing.
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:14.480]   "Christianity is not what you do.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.060]   "It is trusting in what Christ has done."
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.900]   Christianity is not what you do
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.660]   to make yourself righteous in God's eyes.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.740]   That's dead religion.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:24.300]   Christianity is understanding that there's nothing
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.180]   that you can do to ever make yourself perfect again,
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:27.680]   and it's being poor in spirit.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.020]   It's mourning.
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.020]   It's being meek.
[00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:34.060]   It's hungering after righteousness
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.340]   'cause you see the ruin that comes
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.740]   from your unrighteousness.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.940]   Christianity is what God has done,
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:42.060]   embracing it by grace through faith.
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:48.300]   And so here's what we should do as people
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.500]   who have taken a log out of our own eye.
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.340]   We're not betting the people
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:52.460]   are gonna be at Exotica this weekend.
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:53.500]   We're just like 'em, frankly,
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.740]   maybe just 'cause we wanna, for whatever reason right now,
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:58.420]   have some standing in the Christian community.
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:03.420]   Some of us kinda are thinking that we're not gonna go down
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.580]   there 'cause they don't wanna be caught.
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.460]   You know, we're not gonna go down there
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.300]   'cause they don't wanna be caught,
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:08.140]   but you're gonna look at plenty of it.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:08.960]   You don't need to go down there.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.220]   You got all the Exotica you want right here
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.260]   in your little smartphone, your computer,
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.540]   and you're gonna judge those people that are so brazen
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:17.440]   they'll pay for it and go walk around.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.020]   No, man, those are my brothers and sisters down there.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:22.920]   I'm just like 'em.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:27.320]   God's been kind to me, an ungrateful and wicked man.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:31.300]   So I wanna tell them about the hope that I've got,
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.380]   that God has allowed me to be sovereign over this flesh
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:36.860]   which seeks destruction.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:40.260]   So here's what I'd exhort you to do
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:42.060]   as you try and figure out what to do
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.620]   with this text as a right application.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.700]   Number one, I would just tell you, man,
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:46.940]   number one, let...
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:52.340]   Well, I'll start by just saying this, man.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:53.180]   It's a better way to say it.
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:54.260]   Number one, get to know yourself.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:56.060]   I mean, really get to know yourself.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:57.260]   I mean, be honest about who you are.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.460]   Quit trying to help people think
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:01.420]   that you're some really righteous person.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:02.820]   Get to know yourself.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:03.820]   You know who I am?
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:04.900]   I'm somebody who's a sinner.
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:07.220]   I'm saved by grace, by the grace of God,
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:08.140]   sustained by Christ.
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.380]   I am desperately sick.
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:11.580]   My heart is deceitful above all else.
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:13.100]   I've been justified as a saint.
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:16.460]   I am being sanctified by God's grace,
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:18.980]   God's word, God's spirit, and God's people,
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:20.440]   but I'm not yet glorified.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.340]   I sometimes act pridefully.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:24.880]   I sometimes act in anger.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:28.260]   I sometimes double-click on a lustful thought
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.620]   and don't flee immorality.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:34.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:46.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:52.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:54.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:04.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:08.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:10.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:14.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:20.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:28.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

[01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:00.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:02.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:14.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.620]   I sometimes act in a way that's not right.
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.620]   My friends, they know.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.620]   They know exactly where the enemy's gonna attack me.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.620]   They pray for me.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.620]   They make sure I'm removing from myself
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.620]   opportunities to bring destruction into my life.
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.620]   They exhort me towards
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.620]   things that make for peace and righteousness
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.620]   in life, and that is the only reason
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.620]   you won't see me at Exotica this weekend.
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.620]   That is the only reason.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.620]   Because of the grace of God
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:06.620]   manifest through His people, His Word,
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.620]   and His Spirit.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.620]   So let others know you.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.620]   And you let others love you.
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.620]   And you tell them, "If you ever see me moving in another direction,
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.620]   man, I want you to judge that what I'm doing is wrong.
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.620]   I want you to speak the truth to me in love.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.620]   I want you to admonish me,
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.620]   encourage me, and help me."
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:24.620]   Psalm 141
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:26.620]   says, "Let the righteous
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.620]   smite me in kindness.
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.620]   It is as oil upon the head.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.620]   Do not let me
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:34.620]   refuse it."
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.620]   You let
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.620]   others love you. And can I just give you one more
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:40.620]   assignment?
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.620]   Because
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.620]   America pivots on whether
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.620]   or not you do this last thing.
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.620]   You gotta love
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.620]   other people.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.620]   You gotta speak up.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:56.620]   If you think you would have spoken up in the middle
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.620]   of a Holocaust in the 1940s
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.620]   if you lived in Germany, prove it.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.620]   'Cause there's a bigger Holocaust going on
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.620]   right now, right around you.
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.620]   If you haven't been paying attention to a few videos that are
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:08.620]   pushing it in your face right now, tune in.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.620]   Speak up.
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.620]   And don't mind
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:14.620]   that you're hated because you speak up.
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.620]   Courageous men were hung and executed
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.620]   because they spoke up
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.620]   in the 1940s. And you stop
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.620]   telling me that you would have stood against
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.620]   racism. Because I'm gonna tell you something.
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.620]   Slavery was institutionalized
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.620]   racism.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.620]   And abortion is institutionalized
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.620]   murder.
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.620]   And I'm not mad
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.620]   at racists.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.620]   I'm not mad
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.620]   at people who are having abortions. I know
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.620]   what it does. We have a ministry here called Someone Cares.
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.620]   If you've been a part of an abortion story, would you let us love
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.620]   you and let you find the forgiveness that
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.620]   God has for women like
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.620]   you that have made that decision? We've got a ministry called
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.620]   Forgotten Fathers. Would you let us help you?
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:56.620]   We want you
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:58.620]   to find the grace and forgiveness that we need.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.620]   Just like you.
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:02.620]   But you better speak up,
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.620]   people. Love others.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.620]   Silence in the midst of sin
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.620]   is sin.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:12.620]   Father, I pray for my friends that we would just unleash
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:16.620]   a thousand lovers of this world
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.620]   who are willing to do what you
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.620]   did. Which is
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:22.620]   suffer for the sake of righteousness. To be
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.620]   hated because truth sounds
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.620]   like hate to those who hate the truth. And we were
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.620]   haters of truth. We were hateful.
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:30.620]   Hating one another.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.620]   Filled with envy. Malice.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:36.620]   And in your kindness, you saved us.
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:40.620]   And so I pray, Father, we too would save others.
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:42.620]   We'd save them
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.620]   by speaking the truth in love. We'd save them by
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.620]   looking to ourself.
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.620]   Assu, we too be tempted.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:52.620]   First getting the log out of our own eye and then in
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.620]   gentleness, with kindness, speaking the
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:56.620]   truth, no matter what they say to us.
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.620]   Make us men.
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.620]   Make us godly women.
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:02.620]   Make us teachers and
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.620]   prophets and evangelists for you.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.620]   Send us forth
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.620]   to this city, to our roommates,
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.620]   families and world. For the glory
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.620]   of Christ and the good of your people in Jesus name I pray.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.620]   Amen.
