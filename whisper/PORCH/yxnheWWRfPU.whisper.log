[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.860]   - All right, well, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.020]   Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix, Fayetteville, Tulsa,
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.140]   Nashville, Philadelphia, wherever you are joining,
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.020]   if you're just listening and live streaming,
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.480]   we are continuing the series, Rated R for Romance.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.820]   Let me start this way.
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.460]   I've got a random kind of side hobby
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.280]   that I do from time to time called fixing up golf carts.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.380]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.780]   Every now and then on Craigslist
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.140]   or like one of these five mile or kind of resell apps,
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.900]   there'll be like somebody selling a golf cart
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.940]   and just through like years,
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.180]   I've kind of learned like different ways
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.020]   to kind of trick them out.
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.180]   It's like a fun random hobby.
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.780]   Some people, you know, like to work on things
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.380]   and build things, fix up golf carts.
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.860]   One recently I had found was in the country
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.220]   and this guy was selling a golf cart
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.740]   and was like, oh dude, I could like, you know,
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.220]   put a lift on that, that would be awesome.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.620]   Just a little flip project on the side.
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.740]   And I reached out, the golf cart was available.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.700]   So I rented a trailer and I went in
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.380]   and headed out to his home out in the country,
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.420]   got to his house, looked at the golf cart.
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.580]   This all looks great.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.260]   And side note about the guy,
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.980]   this was like one of the more interesting interactions
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.820]   that I had.
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.900]   This dude is like in his 30s, show up to his place.
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.540]   He lives on this huge plot of land.
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.660]   He has an airplane strip in front of his house
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.220]   where planes get to land in front.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.180]   He's got seven kids all running around,
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.900]   like ages 13 to two.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.200]   All of them have four wheelers.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.240]   It was like, dude, where am I right now?
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.380]   And Callie, if I don't come home, they murdered me.
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.180]   And so it just was like this,
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.020]   where he's got his own pond.
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.620]   He was like, yeah, dug that pond up.
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.540]   And the dude was like the most he-man
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.020]   I've ever been around because at one moment,
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.340]   I'm looking at the golf cart and I'm like, hey,
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.260]   you know, part of the metal underneath this thing is bent
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.320]   and that's not good.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.180]   And expecting him to be like,
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.460]   well, I'll take a couple hundred bucks off it.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.260]   He's like, all right, let's take it down to the shed.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.420]   Takes it down to the shed.
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.380]   Dude pulls out a straight up welder
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.700]   and puts the mass down and was like,
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.820]   and welds new metal onto the bottom.
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.660]   He was like, I'm not worthy.
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.500]   Okay.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.900]   And so he, you know, I ended up buying the golf cart
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.580]   and I loaded onto this trailer I'd gotten from U-Haul
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.020]   and it doesn't fit.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.500]   And I'm like, oh no, this is not good.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.740]   I got to leave with this thing.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.580]   I've rented it.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.400]   I'm like over an hour out here.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.240]   What am I going to do?
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.060]   And the guy's like, oh, you know,
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.900]   I'll just give you some rope.
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.400]   We can tie it down and it'll be fine.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.320]   And I'm like, oh, that's great.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.080]   He hands me the rope and then it hits me.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.660]   And this moment I've experienced a lot of times
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.960]   where I begin to think,
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.540]   I don't know what type of knot to tie here.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.920]   Like I didn't, I wasn't a boy scout
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.360]   and some of you guys were Eagle Scouts and you're like,
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.400]   oh, well, here's what you got to do there.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.200]   And you know exactly what to tie.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.600]   But I was like, I'm the kind of guy that just ends up
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.080]   like being like, oh man, I'm just going to rope this around
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.500]   like 15 different times and pull really hard.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.560]   Hopefully that'll hold.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.360]   And I'm like thinking through there and I'm like, yeah,
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.240]   what kind of knot would you tie?
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.080]   He man.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.920]   And he's like, oh, and he uses some term.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.360]   And I'm like, it's like, you know,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   I would do a square double back fender.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.400]   And I'm like, yeah, square double back fender, right.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.320]   I don't really like my square double back fender.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.480]   What's yours look like?
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.780]   Maybe I could check out how you do yours, make sure.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.520]   And eventually I just give him my man card
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.660]   and I'm like, here, just take it.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.040]   And can you tie a knot on this golf cart
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.500]   and tie it to the trailer?
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.360]   Because one thing I don't want to happen
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.120]   is for me to just out of pride,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.600]   end up tying some janky knot that's like, you know,
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.360]   here's the bunny ears and pull.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.920]   And it ends up having a golf cart fly off a trailer
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.680]   on the highway at like 70 miles an hour.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.720]   So he ties up this different knot and everything goes fine.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.120]   Now, what does that have to do with rated R for romance
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.560]   or relationship goals?
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.920]   Well, in that scenario,
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.680]   I knew that something valuable was at stake.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.640]   So risking tying a knot that wouldn't hold
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.320]   would come undone with something that I didn't want to do.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.680]   And in the same way, we have a term
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.480]   for marriage and relationships
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.880]   that is very similar to the scenario I was in there.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.120]   We call it tying the knot.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.960]   And people come together
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.600]   and they tie the knot in relationships
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.420]   and they get married.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.920]   You've probably heard this phrase before of,
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.200]   hey, when did you tie the knot?
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.400]   Or hey, we're gonna tie the knot.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.640]   And people form a relationship and they date
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.480]   and then they get married and they tie the knot.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.080]   But tragically, about half of the knots that are tied
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.480]   end up unraveling and coming apart.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.560]   And so how can you and I be people who know
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.780]   that we're stepping in the direction of tying a knot
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.240]   that will last all of this life?
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.880]   That we're not gonna end up like a statistic
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.060]   and be a part of tying the knot with someone else
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.060]   and years later, it just begins to unravel together.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.160]   And one of the reasons I think
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.480]   why so many people come together
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.680]   and they form this relationship
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.520]   and they make this promise and they stand
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.840]   on their wedding day and they pledge
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.960]   'til death do us part and they tie the knot
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.440]   and then months, years,
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.360]   a fixed amount of time or a certain amount of time later,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.820]   they end up standing in front of that person
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.000]   and they're signing divorce papers.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.100]   Saying, I never want you in my life again.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.420]   Because their knot was not strong enough to hold.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.480]   And as tragic as it would be to tie a knot
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.120]   that ends up having a golf cart fly off of a trailer,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.680]   infinitely more tragic is tying a relationship knot
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.280]   and marriage that ends up falling apart.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.320]   Like you can get another golf cart,
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.040]   you can get another trailer,
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.860]   you don't get another shot at your first marriage.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.000]   You don't get another shot at your 20s,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.680]   you don't get another shot at your dating,
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.960]   at your love life, even your soul.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.200]   And the way that romance and sex and love impacts it.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   And the God who's there doesn't want you
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.160]   to go through not knowing how to tie
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.880]   and move towards one another and create a bond
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.980]   and create a knot that will last,
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.640]   that nothing in this life will be able to tear apart.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.400]   But it's not gonna happen by you doing it
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.560]   on your own opinion or following how you think it's best.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.460]   Just like in that scenario,
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.200]   I knew that if I go based on how I think
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.080]   I should tie the knot,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.800]   it could have very big consequences and tragic ones.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   Or I could say, you know how to tie knots, he-man.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.840]   You tie the knot.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.720]   And the God who's there is saying,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.400]   are you gonna try to do this on your own?
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.520]   And if so, you risk becoming a liability
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.680]   or becoming another statistic
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.960]   'cause your knot's gonna unravel.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.520]   Or you can trust the God who's there who says,
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.960]   I know how to tie knots, I created marriage,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.780]   I know how to best move towards a relationship
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.080]   that will last.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.360]   So tonight, we are gonna talk about dating,
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.200]   the dating phase and how to move,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.420]   'cause the dating phase is kinda moving your relationship
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.940]   in the direction of creating a knot and a bond
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.600]   that will never be able to separate or come apart.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.960]   And so we're gonna explore what it looks like
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.160]   to date well, to begin to form the relationships.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.000]   'Cause one of the reasons why knots end up unraveling
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.620]   is because of dating so poorly.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.480]   And we are exploring in the book of Song of Solomon,
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.140]   the second phase in this couple's relationship.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.180]   So if you weren't here last week
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.240]   you can go to iTunes or go to Spotify,
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.040]   you can check out the podcast and what you missed.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.940]   But we opened up the book of Song of Solomon.
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.880]   Song of Solomon is one of the most risque books
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.780]   in all the Bible.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.580]   It's an exploration of a man and a woman
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.540]   and their marriage and their sexuality
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.540]   and their love and romance for each other.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.320]   If you thought God was against sex or romance,
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.160]   you were wrong.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.040]   He created it and he even included
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.780]   an entire book of the Bible
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.540]   that is all about his celebration
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.940]   and this couple's exploration of love, romance
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.080]   and each other in sex.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.300]   It's so risque that we said last week
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.220]   Hebrew boys and girls were not able to read this book
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.260]   until they were 30 or married
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.400]   because rabbis were like,
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.260]   "Dude, that is gonna make everybody hot and bothered.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.600]   "We need to just keep that from them until they're married."
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.840]   And it's a beautiful picture of this relationship
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.720]   that God just celebrates and he keeps in the Bible.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.460]   So to review, it reads a little bit,
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.760]   it's a song called Song of Solomon
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.920]   and it reads a little bit like Shakespearean poetry
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.820]   and in it there's a Romeo and a Juliet.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.060]   There's a man and a woman.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.520]   Last week, they kind of began to form
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.180]   their initial relationships and sparks of attraction
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.000]   and this week, we're gonna catch up
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.740]   as they continue their relationship
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.380]   and we're gonna see them go from increasing amounts
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.560]   of intimacy and deepening in their relationship
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.660]   and all the way at the end of tonight,
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.960]   they're gonna get engaged.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.320]   And so we're gonna explore three things
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.880]   that every healthy dating relationship
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.500]   should include as a part of them.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.840]   That every healthy dating relationship
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.160]   should have progressing, expressing
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.720]   and addressing involved in certain areas.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.000]   Progressing, expressing and addressing.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.520]   So we're gonna unpack exactly what those are
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.760]   but let me read the verses first
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.160]   and then we'll dive into exactly them.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.300]   So this comes from Song of Solomon, chapter two, verse eight.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:51.580]   The woman speaking, she says, "Listen, my beloved, look.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.440]   "Here he comes leaping across the mountains
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.500]   "and bounding over the hills.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.140]   "My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag."
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.260]   She's basically like, look, my boy is a stud.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.680]   "Look, there he stands behind our wall,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.580]   "gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice."
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.380]   I'll explain what exactly is going on there.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.380]   "My beloved spoke to me and he said,"
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.140]   here's what he says, "Arise, my darling,
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.340]   "my beautiful one, come with me.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.780]   "See, the winter has passed and the rains are over.
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.920]   "Flowers appear on the earth.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.620]   "The season of singing has come, spring.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.420]   "The cooing of doves is heard in our land.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.300]   "The fig tree forms its early fruit.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.160]   "Blossoming vines spread their fragrance.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.940]   "Arise, come, my darling, my beautiful one,
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.640]   "come with me into this new season.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.620]   "My dove," him speaking, that's his girl,
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.720]   "in the clefts of the rock,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.960]   "in the hiding places of the mountain,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.660]   "come out from hiding and show me your face.
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.220]   "Let me hear your voice,
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.580]   "for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely."
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.260]   They both speak in verse 15.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.380]   "Catch the foxes for us,
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.740]   "the little foxes that could ruin the vineyards
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.240]   "or our relationship,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.180]   "because our vineyards or our relationship is in bloom."
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.100]   And she says, "My beloved is mine and I'm his.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.860]   "He browses among the lilies.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.820]   "Until the day breaks and the shadows flee,
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.760]   "turn, my beloved," she's talking about her boo,
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.580]   "and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the rugged hills."
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.260]   Rugged hills, interesting side note.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.240]   If you have the NA, or different translations
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.380]   translate these different words or different ways.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.460]   If you have the NASB, which is just another translation,
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.940]   you have beether hills inside of there.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.740]   Or rugged mountains is another word.
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.980]   Beether, and the beether mountains is something that,
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.520]   there's no place on earth called the beether mountains.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.360]   What are they saying?
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.100]   Beether is a word that means cleavage.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.600]   So she is saying, come, this girl is,
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.700]   she is getting excited about the next chapter,
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.860]   which is the wedding night,
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.820]   and she's beginning to talk about,
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.000]   "Hey dude, come all night long.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.040]   "That's until the shadows flee and the morning breaks.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.340]   "And I want you to play on the mountains of cleavage.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.340]   "I want you to play with my breasts," is what she says.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.540]   It's in your Bible.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.580]   Some of you guys are like,
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.000]   man, I've got my memory verse picked out for this week.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.700]   All night long, she has,
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.500]   she then goes into like this nightmare she has.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.900]   "All night long I was on my bed,
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.980]   "yearning for the one that my heart loves.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.580]   "I looked for him, but I did not find him.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.440]   "I will get up and I will go about the city."
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.340]   So she begins to explain this nightmare she's having.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.400]   "Through its streets and its squares,
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.940]   "I will search for the one whom my heart loves.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.200]   "So I looked for him, but I did not find him.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.280]   "The watchman found me as they made the rounds in the city
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.780]   "and I said, 'Have you seen the one my heart loves?'
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.020]   "Scarcely had I passed them
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.420]   "when I found the one my heart loves.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.640]   "And I held him and I would not let him go
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.360]   "till I brought him into my mother's house,
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.900]   "to the room of the one who conceived me,
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.420]   "the most intimate part of my life.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.640]   "Daughters of Jerusalem,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.860]   "I charge you by the gazelles and the does of the field,
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.940]   "do not arouse or awaken love until it's time."
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.940]   So as hot and bothered as she is, she still says,
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.700]   "Do not introduce sex until it's time."
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.980]   There's three things I wanna pull out
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.240]   from this couple and their relationship that are growing
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.980]   that are so relevant to you if you're dating,
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.740]   so relevant if you ever have a dating relationship.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.380]   And if these are not a part of your dating relationship,
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.060]   you should be concerned.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.020]   The first one is that if you are in a relationship,
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.160]   it should be a relationship
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.860]   that is progressing towards marriage.
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.220]   Now let me read verses eight through 13 again.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.580]   She says, "Hey, listen, my beloved.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.360]   "Here he comes, leaping over the mountains,
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.460]   "bounding over the hills.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.200]   "He's like a gazelle, young stat.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.300]   "He stands there behind our wall."
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.580]   She's speaking metaphorically.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.740]   There's a wall of separation.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.820]   And he's gazing through the windows,
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.140]   peering through the lattice.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.340]   He desires to move closer and progress towards each other
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.940]   in the relationship.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.900]   And then it says that he speaks to her and he says,
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.780]   "Arise, my darling, beautiful, and come with me.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.600]   "The winter is past and spring is here.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.920]   "There's a new season and I want you to come with me
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.700]   "into this next season of life."
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.520]   He says, "The rains are over, flowers appear on the earth.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.900]   "The season of singing has come.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.980]   "Cooing of doves is heard on our land."
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.540]   He's pointing to spring being here.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.260]   Essentially like that idea of ring by spring.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.880]   He's saying, "Hey, girl, I want you to come with me
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.620]   "into this next season of life.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.060]   "I want us to progress forward."
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.460]   If you were in a dating relationship,
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.580]   and healthy dating relationships
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.220]   involve your relationship progressing towards marriage.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.680]   In other words, it's not just stagnant.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.860]   It doesn't just stay there.
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.340]   Your relationship is going somewhere.
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.740]   If you were perpetually waiting
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.220]   and you're perpetually just kind of in the,
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.300]   man, we've been dating for six years.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.620]   You should be concerned.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.640]   You should break up.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.380]   You should move on and be honest enough with one another.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.220]   You should be progressing somewhere.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.940]   Dating is meant to be a path that leads towards a promise.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.380]   That's marriage that leads towards a lifelong pursuit.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.780]   It's not just meant to be this dating.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.940]   It's not just similar to essentially this.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.100]   Dating is meant to involve you going in
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.380]   and you begin to say, "Is this someone
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.060]   "that I can move towards the destination of marriage with?"
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.300]   The end goal is not dating.
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.940]   The end goal is moving towards marriage.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.740]   The dating is almost like going to the airport.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.220]   The airport is not a place that anyone wants to go
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.020]   to hang out or anyone wants to spend a lot of time.
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.500]   The only reason you go to the airport
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.940]   is not to hang out at the airport
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.220]   unless you need counseling.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.600]   Because the reason you go to the airport
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.920]   is to go to your destination.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.940]   I mean, you go through security
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.180]   and you go when you're in there and you're sitting there.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.380]   It's not because you're like, "Oh, this is great.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.760]   "I love how the airport feels and it smells and security.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.200]   "Love taking off the old belt and hanging out in here.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.140]   "And I love that everything is priced
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.380]   "like 10 times more than the rest of the world.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.660]   "So a banana is a quarter out there.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.900]   "It's $6 in here."
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.420]   What is wrong with you people?
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.700]   You only go to the airport
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.440]   in order to move to another destination.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.100]   Dating is not the destination.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.220]   Dating is like the airport.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.880]   And just like you don't casually go hang out at the airport,
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.380]   you don't casually go date
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.540]   unless you are ready to move in the direction of marriage.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.860]   That if you are dating
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.140]   and it's not for the intent of getting married,
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.740]   you should break up.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.740]   You are playing with fire.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.420]   You are playing with emotions and heart level
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.140]   in a way that God never created you
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.180]   to have intimacy with someone.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.980]   Emotional, spiritual, physical,
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.620]   in an exclusive way
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.820]   that didn't have the purpose
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.620]   of us moving towards marriage someday.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.660]   And just like it is expensive to hang out
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.940]   or everything costs more
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.860]   the more that you hang out at the airport,
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.740]   it is an expensive thing to begin to spend time
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.460]   in a dating relationship, giving your heart
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.300]   and then ripping it apart from someone.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.620]   You are not meant to spend a season
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.180]   or extended season of aimlessly dating without a purpose.
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.900]   You are to be moving in the direction.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.860]   This relationship is moving towards marriage.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.820]   And if you're not in a place
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.700]   where you are ready to say like,
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.580]   "Man, I could be married in the next year,"
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.820]   you should not be dating.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.580]   It's been said that dating without the intent of marriage
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.260]   is like going shopping with no money.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.820]   You will either leave frustrated,
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.300]   everything that you see are frustrated,
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.420]   or you're gonna steal something that doesn't belong to you.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.780]   If you date without the intent of marriage,
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.500]   you are setting yourself up to end up frustrated
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.980]   and discouraged and angry and hurt by how it went,
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.100]   or you're gonna steal something that doesn't belong to you.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.220]   Part of the other person's heart, their sexual purity,
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.820]   you're gonna end up taking something that is not yours.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.020]   And so if you are not at a place
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:12.860]   where you can honestly say,
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.900]   "Man, I want this relationship to progress."
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.540]   It's not just kind of hanging out for years
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.460]   or with no purpose, and it's aimlessly.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.540]   If I'm stuck in a holding pattern, you should break up.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.100]   So let me give specifically, really quickly, the timeline.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:27.940]   Here's what it should look like.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.060]   Here's the progression.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.420]   Should start with singleness.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.140]   You're single, they're single.
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.900]   You're single well, you're healthy,
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.180]   you're in a season where you're like,
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.620]   "Man, I feel like I could be married in the next year."
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.660]   I'm not saying I will,
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.940]   but you're not 14 in middle school,
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.660]   and you're not in a place where you're like,
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.020]   "You know, I need to finish school.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.960]   "I need to finish law school, and I've got three more years,
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.180]   "and I'm definitely not getting married
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.140]   "until I get done with that."
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.260]   You should not date,
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:57.020]   because you are setting yourself up to fail.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.660]   You're gonna date for three years?
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.940]   You weren't made to be with someone
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.540]   that you increasingly grow emotionally
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.780]   and physically attracted to,
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.020]   and you just want to be together for three years.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.860]   So you're either gonna cross boundaries physically,
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.620]   or if you don't have any desire to move further
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.780]   in the relationship, that's probably concerning too.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.780]   You're like, "This is great.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.800]   "We're just friends, and I love being with her.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.520]   "No real anything there, but this is great.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.780]   "We're in this dating relationship."
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.300]   You should be concerned there.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.720]   And so if you're not in a place where you're like,
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.780]   "Man, I really could see myself
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.860]   "entering the next season of life,"
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.100]   then you should not be dating.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.940]   But let's say you are.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.020]   So you're single, they're single.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:33.980]   Here's what happens next.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.140]   A date.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.700]   A date happens where the guy comes up,
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.520]   and he initiates the date, and he goes up and says,
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.860]   "I would like to take you out for blank."
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.020]   Maybe it's dinner.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.540]   The guy initiates and says,
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.220]   "I would like to ask you out on a date."
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.020]   Now the girl either reciprocates with a,
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.660]   "Yes, I'd like to do that," or you say, "No.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.340]   "I would not like to go on a date with you."
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.100]   But the guy initiates, and you may be wondering,
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.200]   "I thought we said girls could kinda
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.380]   "put themselves out there."
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.820]   We'll even bring more clarity to that
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.140]   in the Q and A after this.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.160]   But sure, there's a way in which you could strategically
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.300]   put yourself in the presence of godly men.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.100]   But the Bible says men are called to lead
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.540]   in 1 Corinthians 11, Genesis 2,
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.580]   that God created men to initiate and to lead.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.940]   So men, you go up, here's what you're gonna do.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.940]   You're gonna use your words, you're gonna ask her,
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.740]   "I'd like to go on a date with you,"
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.980]   or, "I'd like to go to dinner with you,"
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.940]   or, "I have tickets to a Mavs game,
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.600]   "and I would love you to come with me.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.820]   "I'd love to spend time with you."
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.180]   You initiate, you ask.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.640]   You risk rejection.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.240]   That's what you do.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.100]   And you risk rejection.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.380]   And so could you be rejected?
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.220]   Yes.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.180]   And you know what happens?
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.300]   If you're a godly guy, and you ask out a godly girl,
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.140]   and she rejects you, dude, I am so proud of you.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.820]   I mean it.
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.180]   Because you are doing what men do, you step up.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.740]   Do you only wanna do things in life
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.540]   where you only do 'em if you know that you won't fail?
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.380]   Really?
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.740]   You're like, "Yeah, I would ask out her.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:51.620]   "She would be awesome.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.920]   "I just feel like she'd be great.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.180]   "But I'll settle with this girl,
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.820]   "'cause for sure she's gonna date me."
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.020]   You really wanna live like that?
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.660]   Like, be courageous.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.500]   Go ask.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.500]   And if you get rejected, dude, high five.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.420]   I'm proud of you.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.260]   Way to go.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.660]   And girls, here's what I would say.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.820]   If he's a godly guy, you should go on a date with him.
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.180]   If he's a godly guy, and you're a godly girl,
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.100]   you should go on a date with him.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.780]   Guys, so they initiate.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.100]   I would plan something fun,
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.340]   because if you have a boring date,
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.940]   it'll be hard to determine, are they boring?
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.500]   Is the date boring, or am I boring?
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.020]   And so I would plan something that's somewhat engaging
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.740]   and fun where you can talk together.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.940]   This is my opinion.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.140]   I think, girls and guys,
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.340]   you should give each other a chance of two dates.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.180]   Why?
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.180]   Because if you have one dud date,
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.380]   and you're like, we got coffee and just sat there,
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.660]   and they were having a bad day,
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.820]   you may not have a great read.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.820]   That's just my opinion.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.220]   Wouldn't die on that hill.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.660]   But, guys initiate, you ask them on a date.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.500]   So let's say they say yes, you go on that date,
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.340]   it's great, everything's going fine.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.060]   You end up going on another one.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.500]   You communicate, I'd love to take you on a second date.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.020]   Girls, if you don't wanna go on a second date,
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.100]   you don't say, yeah, that's great,
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.060]   and then just fall off the face of the earth
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.020]   and ignore them.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.180]   You say, thanks so much,
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.700]   I wouldn't like to go on a second date.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.860]   Same thing if it's a third.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.460]   Thanks so much, I wouldn't like to go on a third date
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.940]   if you end up going on a second.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.220]   But at some point, if the relationship progresses,
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.860]   then you move from single to dating,
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.420]   or a date to dating.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.580]   And it goes from a noun, date, to verb, dating.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.420]   And the way that you get there is guys,
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.620]   you sit them down, and you have what's called a DTR.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.180]   You define the relationship.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.880]   You say, I would like for you, thank you.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.780]   See, look, there's girls clapping in here
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.620]   because so few men actually do this.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.620]   If you do it, you automatically are in the top 10%, okay?
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.180]   So, wow.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.140]   Wow.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.980]   For real, dude, that is easy.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.100]   You're gonna get married, and I want credit, okay?
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.940]   Here's what you do.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.760]   All right, you sit them down, and you're like,
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.420]   I have really enjoyed spending time with you,
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.620]   and you just tell them the truth.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.620]   I'm not sure that we're going to get married,
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.780]   but you're at least the type of person or woman
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.100]   I would like to marry someday,
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.060]   and I would like to continue dating
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.900]   and pursuing you in a relationship,
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.740]   and I'd like you to be my girlfriend.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.100]   You use the word girlfriend.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.060]   That's a big deal.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.380]   May not be a big deal to you, big deal to her.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.020]   You drive clarity into the relationship.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.420]   Leaders remove confusion,
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.420]   and let me just give you a heads up, guys.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.880]   I know it, 'cause I am a guy, and I is one,
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.720]   and I've been there.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.500]   This is gonna be a really awkward conversation.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.340]   You're gonna sit there.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.700]   It's gonna be out front of her house in the car,
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.500]   or maybe it's out here on the patio.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.140]   We're all gonna see you tonight as we walk by,
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.780]   and two of you are standing there,
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.740]   and you're gonna sit there, and you're gonna go,
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.940]   you know, like he was talking about tonight and talk.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.740]   I really would like to spend intentional time
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:37.580]   getting to know you,
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.140]   and I don't know if I'm gonna marry you,
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.500]   but you're the type of person I'd like to marry,
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.780]   and I would love to move this relationship
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.820]   and continue growing and call you my girlfriend.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.820]   Are you okay with that?
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.140]   It's gonna feel awkward.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.460]   You're gonna trip over your words.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.820]   It's gonna feel like you went back to middle school,
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.220]   and your voice is gonna be cracking,
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.920]   and you're doing it right,
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.580]   and you're driving for clarity,
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.660]   and you're caring for her,
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.780]   and you're removing confusion,
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:04.780]   and girls, you honestly answer if you're there,
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.580]   and if you're not, you just say, I'm not there yet,
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.820]   or I don't see this relationship moving forward.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.980]   Thank you for the way that you've honored me,
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.500]   and I don't have any interest in moving forward right now.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.260]   You don't blame it on God.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.320]   You don't blame it on anybody else.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.100]   You speak honestly.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.240]   So there, you're dating.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.820]   So in the dating relationship,
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.100]   there's a couple things that this couple,
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.380]   as they are moving towards their relationship together,
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.260]   they model should be a part of your dating relationship.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.540]   Let me just say one more side note.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.500]   At some point, and this is for extra credit, guys,
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.140]   I'm talking the top 1%, men,
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:43.180]   if you are dating a girl, and her parents are Christian,
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.860]   I think it is a great idea for you
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.500]   in the midst of this early dating stages
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.300]   for you to meet with her father or her mother,
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.740]   if she's a believer, and just clearly articulate,
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.860]   hey, I'm interested in dating and pursuing your daughter.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.400]   I'm not sure that we're gonna get married,
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.840]   but here are my intentions.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.000]   I want to pursue her towards marriage,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.620]   and whether or not God has that, I'm not sure,
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.360]   but I promise I'm gonna honor her and care for her
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.100]   and pursue purity with her.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.440]   Here's my phone number.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.540]   You can call me anytime you'd like,
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.980]   and I'll communicate along the way.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.060]   At least you should do that before you get engaged.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.720]   And so, but in the midst of the dating relationship,
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.060]   I think that's a great practice,
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.740]   especially if she has believer parents or Christian,
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.780]   Christian parents as part of it.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.760]   So in the dating relationship, so back to our couple,
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.380]   they're dating one another, they're hanging out,
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.120]   and he begins to say something to her
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.760]   that articulates something so huge
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.140]   that a part of your relationship,
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.580]   if you're gonna have a healthy dating relationship,
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.980]   on this journey, should involve, and he says this.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.100]   My dove, we said last week, he's not just saying,
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.260]   like, look, bird girl.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.620]   He's saying, doves only have the ability
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.020]   to focus on one thing at a time.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.500]   So he's saying, like, man, you got eyes for me,
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.560]   I got eyes for you.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.620]   My dove in the clefts of the rock
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.380]   are hiding behind the rocks on the mountain,
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.700]   in the hiding places on the mountainside.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.460]   Show me your face.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.060]   Let me hear your voice.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.740]   Come out from hiding and communicate with me.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.580]   Speak with me.
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.700]   Your voice is sweet and your face is lovely.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.620]   I wanna see you.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.260]   Come out from hiding and speak with me,
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.780]   and let me see you are, who you are.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.300]   The second part of your relationship
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.680]   is that at some point, it should involve
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.820]   expressing deep, heart-level things to that person.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.140]   Will you come out from hiding?
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:27.980]   That's what he says to the girl.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.540]   He says, I want you to come out from hiding,
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.440]   and I want you to come speak with me.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.820]   Come out into the open,
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.460]   and share about the things that are in your heart,
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.820]   and share about the things that are in your life,
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.500]   and speak, your voice is beautiful.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.820]   I want you to come out from hiding.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.020]   At some point in your relationship, as it progresses,
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.460]   you should begin to express, at a heart level,
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:50.460]   just the things in your past, things that you fear,
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.180]   things that you hope for,
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:57.500]   some of the ways that you just have scars
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.620]   from not living in line with God's best,
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.820]   that you bring out into the open,
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.280]   your story with that other person.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.980]   Hopefully, you're already doing this in community
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.880]   with other believers, but before you get married
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.980]   to that person, you should do what this couple does,
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.900]   which is come out from hiding and speak tenderly
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.060]   and express your heart to that other person.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.860]   It's a question we get so common, which is like,
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.540]   hey, when do I talk about my sexual past?
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.140]   When do I talk about my history, my problems, my pains?
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.260]   And here's the answer, you ready?
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.760]   When do I bring this stuff up?
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.820]   When you're ready to move the relationship
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.780]   to the next level.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.860]   Like, in other words, this is not something,
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.380]   you know, like on the first day, you're like,
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.700]   yeah, I'm gonna take this soup,
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.560]   and here's my biggest struggle in life, and,
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.100]   that I wouldn't introduce that day one.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.800]   I wouldn't introduce that day five, but at some point,
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.620]   you owe it to the person you're dating, like,
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.120]   man, here's the things in my past,
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.520]   here's the things that are a part of my story.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.460]   Here's some of the wounds that I had growing up.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.620]   And when is when you're ready to see the relationship
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.580]   go to the next level.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.260]   When you're considering engagement,
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.180]   you should share that stuff.
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.100]   What kind of things should I share?
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.260]   Things that involve, man, some of the relational baggage
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.520]   or sexual past.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.980]   Like, man, here's kind of some of my story.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.580]   You don't need a glory in it or honor it.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.220]   You're just kind of bringing it in the open.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.060]   Here's what you should know.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.540]   If there's a sexually transmitted disease,
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.900]   here's what you should know.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.500]   Things that, I mean, one way, honestly, you should share
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.780]   is like, whatever you're afraid of sharing,
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.340]   you probably should share that.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.460]   And I'm not saying early in the relationship
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.140]   or as this thing is blossoming.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.340]   I'm saying before you get engaged,
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.620]   or if you're like, man, we're in that season,
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.820]   I wanna get more serious.
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.460]   One of the best things about merge,
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.580]   which is our premarital ministry,
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.620]   is it drives these types of conversations to happen.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.540]   But before you enter into that season,
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.860]   you should have a season where you're expressing
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.780]   that stuff in your life.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.240]   In general, just expressing kind of your past,
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.620]   what your upbringing was like, what shaped you,
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.940]   where you're carrying wounds.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.300]   If your parents divorce, just things where you're,
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.900]   man, this really impacted and shaped my life.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.500]   Met my hopes, like, this is what I hope to happen.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.820]   These are my fears about what may happen.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.260]   That you're sharing and speaking
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.340]   and communicating those things.
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.740]   Another way of saying it, to use that airport analogy,
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.780]   is, dude, before you move into engagement
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.760]   or before you take off, you should check your bags
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.700]   and check their bags and make sure you know
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.160]   what you are walking into together
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.900]   and that you share those things, how much debt you have.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:33.400]   I remember having this conversation with my wife
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.080]   and just sitting down and talking about just father wounds
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.180]   and being raised pretty much by a single mother
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.140]   or father who wasn't present around
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.940]   and fear of, man, not being the dad that I want to be
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.060]   'cause I didn't have that there.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.820]   Sharing about my sexual past.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:52.380]   Sharing just about the story that God had written in my life.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.460]   And as terrifying as it is, what is amazing
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.900]   is what happens often is we're so afraid,
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.900]   like, man, this person is gonna reject me.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.380]   And oftentimes, the opposite happens,
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.200]   where they go, dude, thank you for sharing.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.040]   Now I know everything and I'm not going anywhere.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.960]   And that fear all of a sudden turns to confidence
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   and intimacy and it's like, man, I'm even more confident.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.360]   We should move forward into the next step.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.800]   But at some point, your relationship,
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.880]   a healthy dating relationship, should involve you sharing
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.360]   and not glorifying sin and doing it in a way
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.080]   that honors and cares about her.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.000]   And so you don't need to go into all the types of details
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.620]   of like, this is what I did with Becky.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.260]   And you don't need to go very, like, hyper-specific.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.160]   And if you're a girl and you're going,
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.460]   no, I wanna know exactly what you did with Becky,
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.800]   you probably should slow down, girl,
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.620]   and just check whatever's in your heart
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.860]   that may be feeding that, but doing it in a way
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.500]   that honors the Lord and honors this person
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.780]   and just comes out into the open.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.120]   And he says, my dove, come out, communicate with me.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.300]   Come out of hiding.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.960]   I wanna see who you are.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.540]   The Bible says that in Genesis chapter two,
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.220]   God's design for marriage was that Adam and Eve
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.260]   were naked and without shame.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.560]   I see all that you are, and I'm not going anywhere.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.420]   And I love you.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.940]   And the direction and destination that God wants for you
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.880]   in marriage involves that.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.140]   And you owe it to that person before you move
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:29.620]   into the next season of sharing who you are.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.020]   And if they don't accept you for who you are, move on.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.000]   Because they don't have the heart of Christ
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.120]   who accepts all of us and accepted all of us
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.680]   as who we are, despite all of it.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.840]   And they may not be at a place where they're mature enough
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.080]   to see and do that and move past that.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:54.360]   The third quality that we see from this relationship
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:58.640]   is that they involve addressing
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.360]   their specific relationship issues.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.680]   Verse 15 of chapter two.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:08.300]   They both chime in and say, catch the foxes.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.900]   The little foxes that ruin the vineyards.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.660]   Our vineyards are our relationship,
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.500]   is what they're talking about, that are in bloom.
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.580]   So hey, our relationship is growing,
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.500]   it's flourishing, and it's growing up.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.500]   Catch the foxes that could hurt and destroy
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.580]   this growing relationship from getting
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.060]   to where it ultimately desires to go to.
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.140]   Like hey, cut off anything that's gonna hurt our intimacy.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.760]   What was the foxes, what is he talking about?
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.100]   Foxes in vineyards today, even in Napa Valley,
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.080]   this still happens, where foxes will come up
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.040]   and they will basically, in a vineyard,
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.360]   they're growing grapes, and those grapes
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.740]   will start as a bud.
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.720]   And at the beginning of the spring season,
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.320]   those buds will form and foxes will come along
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.760]   and they will eat those buds before they ever flourish
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.480]   or bloom into grapes.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.280]   The foxes will show up and they'll kind of cut them off
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.920]   before they ever grow into what they were intended
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.760]   to grow into.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.160]   She's basically saying, and he's basically saying,
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.640]   hey, let's catch and kill anything that's gonna hurt
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.920]   our relationship from growing further.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.040]   And intimacy, anything that's gonna hurt our relationship.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.960]   Your third idea, the third part of your relationship
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.720]   should be a relationship involving addressing your issues,
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.840]   addressing your together issues,
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.760]   and addressing your individual issues.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.760]   Anything that's gonna hurt your relationship,
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.620]   anything that you see together,
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.640]   that you go, man, we're gonna sit down,
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.480]   we're gonna talk about this,
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.480]   we're gonna work through this together.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.760]   I want us to be on the same page about this object.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.240]   What do I mean by some of the foxes
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.640]   that may be in your relationship
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.840]   or foxes that may be inside of your life?
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.680]   One of them may be your conflict style.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.320]   That hey, we're gonna work quickly to address the fox
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.460]   that our conflict, which is not a bad thing,
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.000]   we've got tons of messages on conflict,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.840]   if you haven't heard those, but basically conflict
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.400]   or having a disagreement between a person,
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.620]   between two people, is not necessarily a bad thing.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.580]   It can be something that this conflict
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.580]   leads us to form tighter relationship together.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.400]   So we're gonna know how each other,
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.280]   kind of how we fight, and we're gonna fight well
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.680]   and fight fair, and we're gonna allow that
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.680]   to move us closer together.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.620]   So some of you may need to work on
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.680]   and understand your conflict style
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.380]   and their conflict style, so that you don't just
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.880]   get into a relationship and rely on,
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.960]   hey, we're in a fight and we don't really
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.160]   talk to each other and I just kind of
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.180]   go silent for six weeks, or we're just gonna
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.920]   bank on makeup sex all the time, that's gonna be it.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.920]   That's not gonna work, but you need
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.760]   to know your conflict style.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.800]   What do I mean by that?
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.640]   We have a term and an expression called weenie.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.160]   You need to know your weenie and you need to know
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.200]   their weenie.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.760]   Rate it off for romance, people.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.340]   Weenie stands for withdrawal, escalation,
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.240]   negative interpretation, or invalidation.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.480]   In every conflict style, you typically
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.240]   have somebody who's one of those
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.980]   and the other person is another one of them,
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.040]   or you're just like, you hit the jackpot
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.600]   and you're all four of them, and that's gotta be interesting.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.640]   So you need to know, like hey, do I withdraw?
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.520]   Like in conflict, am I like, oh, I just shut down
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.560]   and I try to disappear and I just cover myself up?
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.440]   Are you that person?
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.400]   Are you the escalator?
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.160]   Where they get into a conflict and you escalate
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.200]   and you're like, you know, this is what you always do.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.680]   Are you that person?
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.000]   Are you the negative interpreter where the guy's like,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.600]   hey man, this is great, did you,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.680]   is that a new shirt?
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.960]   And you're like, oh, you think I have a materialism problem?
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.120]   Huh, I'm green, is that what you're trying
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.000]   to tell me right now?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.320]   Or you don't like my fashion choice?
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.280]   Are you a negative interpreter?
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.200]   Or are you an invalidator where the person
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.200]   shares their hurt and you're like, well,
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.160]   that's just 'cause you are a big softie
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.600]   and you need to toughen up in life.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.920]   You know, it's hard, get back in the game.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.160]   All right, which style are you?
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.120]   And you need to know this.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.880]   I'm joking, but this is so huge and so important.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.680]   And you need to know if you're dating someone,
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.360]   you need to have a death grip on what they are
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.640]   and what you are so that you know, like, man,
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.760]   this is just kind of the patterns.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.760]   In my relationship with my wife, I am an escalator,
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.280]   she's a withdrawer, which is very entertaining
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.800]   'cause we get in conflict and she's like,
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   I'm disappearing, I'm like, you come back here.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.960]   That's not funny at all, but,
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.880]   but, (laughing)
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.960]   but in knowing that about one another,
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.160]   here's what that looks like for us.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.440]   It's like she withdraws and it's incumbent on her
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.520]   to know, hey, I need some time to process
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.280]   and I need like a minute and I need some time to think.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.600]   And we have come, and through counsel in our life,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.400]   people have gone, that's fine, but then if you withdraw,
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.700]   you need to know that it is incumbent on you
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.240]   to restart the conversation.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.400]   So you go, he wants to work through right now
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.640]   and you're like, I just need some time.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.240]   Great, you need to go process that yourself
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.640]   and then you arrange for, hey,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.040]   I would like to talk about this.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:24.920]   It is incumbent on you.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.660]   He's trying to work through the conflict.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.360]   Now you, if you need to take time,
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.720]   you can't just let it lie and kinda like
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.880]   hope it'll disappear.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.760]   You go, you work through that, and then you come back
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.040]   and you work through that together.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.440]   Whatever your conflict style is, you need to know that
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.200]   because like so few things,
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.280]   conflict will kill a relationship.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.720]   It is a fox that will eat your relationship
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.000]   and your intimacy.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.640]   It is crushing marriages all over our country,
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.480]   all over our world.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.240]   It has crushed and killed marriages
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.400]   because they couldn't work through conflict
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.920]   and they went from caring about the other person
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.420]   and caring about their relationship to just wanting to win
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.800]   and just wanting to hurt the other person.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.600]   So you need to know your conflict style.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.960]   Other than foxes that you should kill, pornography.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.560]   If you're looking at pornography,
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.280]   you are feeding something that is creating
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.400]   an unrealistic sexual expectation
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.120]   that is going to crush your wife.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.980]   You are feeding something that is telling you
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.880]   and teaching your mind to think a real woman is not enough
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.320]   and one woman is not enough.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.920]   And if you're a girl looking at pornography,
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.000]   you are feeding yourself the same thing.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.480]   A real man is not enough and what matters most
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.040]   is his ability to sexually please me
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.080]   and you're feeding an unrealistic expectation
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.640]   and that is a fox that it is gonna show up
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.080]   and it's feeding an appetite
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:53.680]   that is one of the leading causes of why people get divorced.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.000]   Another fox that'll show up in your relationship
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.200]   would be bitterness and anger
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.040]   that you need to make sure before you get married,
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.320]   before you move into that next relationship,
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.600]   that you have forgiven those who have hurt you most in life.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.040]   I will not do a wedding for someone
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.040]   if they have not forgiven their parents.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:15.440]   If they have said, man, I have never forgiven my dad
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:19.120]   who left or cheated on my mom, I will not do your wedding
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.600]   and I wouldn't advise anybody to do your wedding.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.960]   If they're harboring bitterness,
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.200]   because here's what that means, man, this is so huge.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.880]   They're saying somebody deeply hurt me
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.280]   and I'm holding onto that and I'm not letting it go
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.880]   and I'm holding it against them.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.940]   What do you think marriage is?
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.340]   It is repeated time after time
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.440]   of somebody deeply hurting you, your wife or your husband
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.780]   and you having to choose, I forgive you.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.760]   I'm choosing to believe the best.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.320]   I'm choosing to move in your direction.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.720]   I'm choosing to let that go
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.260]   and if they're not good at letting it go and forgiving now,
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.620]   they're not getting better
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:03.740]   and I would not advise you to move forward
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.640]   in that relationship,
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.420]   regardless of if someone will marry you or not.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.840]   If they have not made the decision,
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.620]   I'm choosing to forgive this person who deeply hurt me
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.360]   and I'm not letting it go.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:20.360]   Another Fox to address in this season is sexual abuse.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.400]   Statistically, the numbers are shocking
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.180]   and they're all over this room.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.640]   If that's a part of your story,
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.360]   it doesn't have to define you.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.080]   It wasn't your fault.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.420]   There's hope, there's healing.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:40.120]   God loves you and the pain that was inflicted there
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.980]   but there will take some healing
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:47.140]   and you pursuing that with God's people
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.500]   and you bringing that into the light
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.180]   and processing and talking through that.
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.540]   You're not damaged goods.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.900]   It won't or it doesn't have to define your marriage
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.740]   or your future sex life and it wasn't your fault
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.080]   and there's hope and there's healing
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.740]   but you've gotta be intentional to accept it
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.620]   or to pursue that because that's a Fox
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.800]   that you didn't even ask for
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.600]   but it's a Fox that can show up
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.300]   and really hurt your relationship
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.740]   and in dating and in your relationship together,
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.260]   regardless of what the Fox is,
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.940]   you guys need to honestly talk about these things
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.140]   and not act like we're sitting there at the dinner table
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:30.980]   and this is so great
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.740]   and there's Foxes everywhere around you
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:33.820]   and the same way that you wouldn't do that
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.340]   if there were ravenous wolves all the way around you,
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.940]   you're just eating and hanging out, this is so great
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.640]   and everywhere you look, there's like, you know,
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.440]   these Foxes looking to kill you, that's what's going on.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.320]   The Bible says that Satan hates you.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.640]   He hates your relationship.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.760]   He wants you to be in shame right now.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.040]   He doesn't want you to get married.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.800]   He wants to kill off your relationships
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.680]   before they ever happen.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.880]   He's not just like a Fox, he's like a roaring lion
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.980]   looking for someone to be devoured.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.200]   I don't even know that I fully understand what that means.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.600]   That's 1 Peter chapter five
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.300]   but I feel like I've seen it
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.760]   and I've seen marriages devoured
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.440]   because these little Foxes, they began to grow
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.000]   and they began to grow and they began to multiply
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.660]   and they just devoured that relationship
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.280]   and you have an enemy and you need to listen to me.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.280]   He hates you.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.720]   He wants you to hide in sin.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.920]   He wants you to hide in shame.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.800]   He doesn't want you guys to work through your dysfunction.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.040]   He just wants you to cover it up with sex.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.320]   Like, oh man, we'll just have crazy manic highs and lows
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.640]   and just cover all that stuff up.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.360]   He doesn't want you to have healthy relationships.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.720]   He wants you to get divorced.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.440]   He wants your kids to grow up without a father
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.400]   or without a mother around.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   He wants you to be depressed.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.240]   He hates you.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.940]   He doesn't want you to listen to any of the things
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.340]   that God's word says about love, romance, sex.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.660]   He wants you to tune it out and go,
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.340]   that's so unrealistic, I'm not doing that.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.980]   Or for you to begin to buy the lie that,
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.100]   oh man, that must work for like
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.440]   goody two-shoe Christian people
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.580]   but I've got a story and I've got a past.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.700]   He hates you.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.540]   That's a lie.
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.400]   And the story that God is gonna write in your life
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.300]   is not over but you are in the driver's seat.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.820]   If you're gonna surrender that to him,
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.900]   are you gonna allow the Foxes
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.480]   and Satan to destroy your relationships?
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.840]   He hates romance.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.520]   He hates sex.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.600]   And he wants to take it out of the context of marriage
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.360]   and inject it into your life.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.740]   And it may bring like some amazing highs in a moment
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.880]   followed with some incredible pain.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:27.200]   And he wants you to wallow in shame.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.600]   And the God who's there loves you.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.880]   He's crazy about you.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.260]   He wants you to have a romance life
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.420]   like you could only dream of.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.180]   And the whole book of this Song of Solomon
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.380]   is about that love story.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.220]   And he's for you.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.660]   And he wants you to experience like the safety
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:46.660]   and security and intimacy with a spouse in marriage.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.320]   And if you're dating right now,
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.380]   you need to be on the lookout.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.940]   Like what are our Foxes?
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.840]   What are the things that are gonna kill our relationship
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.580]   before it continues to grow and blossom all the way there?
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.680]   And then finally in verse 16 it says this.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.840]   My beloved is mine and I'm his.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.360]   He browses among the lilies.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.560]   Scholars debate and disagree and some say
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.880]   that most of this chapter may have been engagement,
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.700]   but without question most will say like
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.680]   this is probably the engagement line.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.280]   She's saying like hey, I'm declaring.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.180]   I'm for you, you're for me.
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.080]   We're in this to win it ride or die together.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.160]   For the rest of our life, that's what's going on.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.000]   We're engaged.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.780]   Further we know that because next week
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.600]   is the wedding and the wedding night.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.460]   And it is about to go down if you know what I'm saying.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.580]   And so we at least know entering into that,
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.220]   they are engaged by this line.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.260]   And they're moving towards tying that knot together.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:42.120]   And if you're gonna move towards tying that knot
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.220]   in relationship, you need to make sure
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.700]   that you are dating in a way that it is progressing.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.660]   At some point you are expressing
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.180]   kind of the intimacy parts of your heart,
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.180]   the intimate parts of your heart,
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.420]   your story, your past.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.620]   And that you're addressing and confronting
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:00.640]   the issues in your life and in your relationship together.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:06.800]   I shared earlier about the idea of like a knot holding.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.620]   And you know, I was thinking about like a knot this week
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.580]   and how do I know if a knot will hold?
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.560]   And I was trying to think of like,
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.860]   are there two types of ropes?
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.100]   Or what are the types of ropes in the world
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.620]   that you take this rope and you take this rope
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.420]   and they really won't hold together?
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:21.300]   And there really isn't one.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.180]   Like you may be going, well what about a really thick rope?
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.140]   And what about like a thin rope?
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.740]   I mean you could still tie a knot out of them.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.620]   There isn't like these two incompatible ropes
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:30.660]   that are unable to tie together.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.260]   What matters in the ability for a knot to hold,
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.920]   think about it, is two things.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:41.820]   Who's tying the knot and what type of knot they're tying.
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.660]   In other words, like my one and a half year old
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.760]   may not be able to tie a knot that's that tight.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.020]   She may end up just like leaving it at this
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.660]   because she's not strong enough to tie it.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:53.480]   Or she doesn't know how to tie a knot
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.680]   that will actually hold.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.120]   The Bible says that your relationship,
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:58.960]   what God hopes for you,
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.760]   and what our hope for this entire series, man,
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.320]   and we are praying that God does incredible things
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.560]   in this room and everywhere,
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.200]   every different PortsLive location,
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.840]   wherever you're listening in from,
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.520]   that God does incredible things in your hearts,
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.080]   relationships, that he sets you up to marry someone
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.140]   who loves Jesus more than he loves you.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.040]   That he's gonna be someone who chases and pursues
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:18.880]   after you the rest of your life,
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.180]   that you follow and lead together
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.020]   for the rest of your life,
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.360]   that you raise children who walk with Jesus together
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.800]   and candidly that he breaks up so many relationships
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.720]   in this room that you need to get out of
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.880]   because you are,
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.880]   candidly, dude, you're not gonna find Mr. Right
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.440]   because you're dating Mr. Right now
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.640]   and you're not gonna experience who God has for you.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.760]   And you're holding on 'cause you're like,
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.680]   we built relational equity together
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.120]   and I'm just afraid of breaking up
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.360]   and I feel like I've gone too far already
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.600]   and you are gonna miss out on what God has for you.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.840]   You always do when you go against God's word.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.800]   What type of knot does God wanna tie
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.040]   as it relates to your relationships?
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.880]   The answer to who's tying the knot,
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.160]   Jesus would say in Matthew chapter 19, is God.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.680]   He says, "For this reason a man will leave his father
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.080]   "and mother and be united to his wife
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.000]   "and the two become one flesh."
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.120]   And he says, "What God has joined or tied together,
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.920]   "let no person separate."
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.780]   That God is the one that ultimately saying like,
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.240]   I wanna tie a knot that is so strong
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.760]   for the rest of your life, nothing in this world,
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.600]   nothing that you face, no matter what you walk through,
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.560]   nothing will tear it apart.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.920]   Every struggle that you go through
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.640]   and everything the world pulls on you
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.080]   is only gonna pull you tighter and tighter and tighter
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.520]   and tighter and tighter together.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.360]   That's the knot that he wants to tie.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.400]   And it's a knot or the type of knot is a covenant.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.560]   That it's not some contract relationship
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.280]   that you have with the other person, what's a contract?
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.480]   It's like, hey, I'm in this and we'll be married
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.120]   unless you gain 20 pounds and then I'm out.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.360]   That's a contract.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.200]   He is a covenant, what's a covenant?
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.120]   It's an unending, unbreakable, unstoppable relationship
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.500]   and bond, commitment to one another.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.260]   No matter what happens, I'm not going anywhere.
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.420]   You cannot have that type of covenant relationship.
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.740]   And the experience of the knot he wants to bond in your life
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.300]   without first having a covenant relationship with God.
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.760]   The first love of your life must be Jesus.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.000]   The first love of their life must be Jesus.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.360]   That's not some preachy language.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.320]   I promise you, I've just seen it too many times.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.680]   Where couples come together and they're sweet
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.320]   and they love hanging out together and this is great
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.480]   and then a few short years go by and they got a kid.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.800]   And they're standing there signing papers
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.100]   and they hate one another.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:35.080]   And it was because they didn't form a covenant,
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.280]   they didn't have the type of knot
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.980]   that God wants to create in your life
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.760]   that is first anchored in a covenant relationship with God.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.240]   If you are not a follower of Jesus,
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.200]   the best thing you can leave with is not how to date
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.340]   and tips and tricks and all that.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.120]   It is that there's a God who's invited you
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.680]   into a love story that is far bigger than Song of Solomon,
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.720]   far bigger than the girl that you met from Tinder,
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.160]   far bigger than any relationship
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.000]   that you will ever have in this life.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.140]   It's his love story of chasing and pursuing you.
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:06.880]   And he wants to create this covenant in your future marriage.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.440]   So no matter what, I'm staying.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.740]   But you won't have that if it's not,
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:13.920]   or if it is disconnected
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.380]   from the covenant relationship with God.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.840]   From the God who said,
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.800]   no matter what you do, I'm staying.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.080]   I died in your place, I gave my life for you.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.320]   How do you know that God can keep a knot that lasts
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.600]   or tie a knot that no matter what you face in this life,
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.640]   it will last, no matter what you walk through, it can hold.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.860]   He's already done it once.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.920]   He has promised that nothing in all of creation,
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.120]   Romans chapter eight says,
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.280]   neither height nor depth nor anything else
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.920]   in all of creation could separate you from the love of God.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.360]   That is the covenant that he's already created.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.780]   You may not know this, if you're not a believer,
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.460]   Christians don't believe like,
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:50.920]   good people go to heaven and we just come in here
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.780]   and we're like, I'm a really good person,
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.620]   that's why I'm here.
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.460]   And we sing songs like,
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:59.340]   ♪ David, David, you're such a really good guy ♪
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:03.160]   We say, Jesus, Jesus, you're our savior, you're our Lord.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.080]   It's only because of you that I have a relationship
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.740]   with God, you pursued me, you came after me,
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.700]   you loved me despite me and you died in my place.
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.840]   And you paid for everything I've ever done.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.940]   And if I will accept and receive that gift,
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:23.520]   I enter into the covenant, the unbreakable love of God,
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.280]   where he says, nothing you ever do you may run,
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.760]   you can't hide from my love.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.200]   And you can't escape it and you can't break it.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.260]   And it's just that, that relationship, you know,
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.800]   that your heart kinda longs for in marriage,
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.000]   you don't even realize it's longing for me.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.720]   It's longing for the love of God
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.440]   and this unending, unstoppable, perfect love.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.840]   It's only in knowing and experiencing that love
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.920]   that you'll have any type of romance
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.120]   that you're looking for.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.180]   And tonight, the choice for many of you is to say,
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.440]   man, am I gonna believe that?
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.660]   And am I gonna receive that?
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.320]   For others of you, you need to evaluate honestly,
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.420]   am I progressing?
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:11.840]   Am I afraid to just express some stuff in my life and heart?
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.360]   And are we addressing, like, are we a good couple?
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.920]   Are we able to actually work through our issues
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.900]   and move forward?
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.080]   Because we have a God who paid for all of our issues.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.160]   They don't define us.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.260]   They don't have to define our relationship.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:30.320]   But the choice is yours.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.640]   Let me pray.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.160]   Father, thank you that you have given us a way
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.680]   that we can have eternal life and abundant life today.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.400]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.920]   God, the greatest romance and love we've ever craved
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.440]   is found in you.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:56.520]   And we just declare that we need your help to believe that,
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.040]   to walk in that, to accept that,
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.160]   that the love I've been looking for
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.040]   since the day I was born is you.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:09.040]   And no marriage and no relationship and no children
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.760]   and no anything else that I would search to satisfy
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.120]   that could actually satisfy it.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.840]   And so would you help us, God, to believe that?
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:18.400]   I pray for friends in the room who are walking through
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.640]   breakup.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.600]   God, for friends that need to break up,
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:29.000]   you give them peace and clarity and conviction.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.580]   Friends that need to move into that next season of marriage
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.320]   that God, you would bless and your hand of favor
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.560]   would be on relationships inside of this room
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.800]   and they would get married.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.880]   They would raise children who know the King,
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.880]   the creator of the world, the savior of all humanity
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.160]   and the lover of their souls.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.440]   Father, we worship you now in song, amen.
