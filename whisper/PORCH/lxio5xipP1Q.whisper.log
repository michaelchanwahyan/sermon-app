[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.900]   - How we doing, the Ports, how we doing?
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.300]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.240]   I wanna welcome you.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.620]   If you're a guest with us, welcome home.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.580]   If you're tuning in from Fort Worth or Houston
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.460]   or one of the streaming campuses
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.580]   or you're driving in your car listening
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.560]   somewhere around the country,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.880]   we're glad you are as we continue this series.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.720]   First comes love.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440]   If we haven't met, my name is JP or Jonathan Picluda
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.760]   and it's just a privilege to be here tonight
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.160]   and jump into this series.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.880]   So we're talking about relationships.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.080]   And let me start with this question, okay?
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.740]   Who is the best basketball player on earth?
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.480]   Do you know who the best basketball player on earth is?
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.960]   Yes, you are correct.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.760]   It is LeBron James, indeed.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.600]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.520]   Yes, it is.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.560]   Yes, it is.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.920]   Which leads me to my second question for you.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.800]   Do you know who the worst basketball player
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.220]   on the planet earth is?
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.800]   (audience chattering)
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.400]   Yes, indeed, again, you are correct.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.560]   It is me, okay?
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.980]   And so here's the interesting fact.
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.080]   LeBron and I, we're the same size.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.600]   We really are, if we haven't met, find out afterwards.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.420]   I know it's proportioned a little bit different,
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.920]   but we are the same.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.640]   And so you say, well, how did you become the worst?
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.680]   If you're the same size as LeBron,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.440]   how did you become the worst basketball player
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.280]   on the planet earth?
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.400]   Did you never practice?
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.220]   No, I did practice.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.060]   Did you not play?
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.800]   I actually did play.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.440]   Here is how I became the worst basketball player
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.280]   on the planet earth.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.320]   It is because I learned the wrong way.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.160]   So at a very early age, little JP,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.520]   growing up on a farm in the middle of nowhere,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.280]   Quero, Texas, South Texas,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.000]   and I'm just kind of watching the guys on TV
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.120]   and they're getting these rebounds
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.240]   and they jump up and they bring it down here.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.980]   And so that's what I do.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.340]   And I just practice that.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.740]   And not only that, but I watched the Harlem Globetrotters
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.100]   and they're doing these like crazy,
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.060]   like hook shots and fadeaways.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.460]   And so no one ever sat me down
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.940]   and showed me the fundamentals.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.380]   I'm just practicing the hook shots all day.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.900]   If it goes in the baskets, it's pure luck,
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.300]   but that's what I do all day long.
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.220]   And so then out there on the farm,
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.860]   got this little hoop, that's what I do all the time.
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.880]   And then I get into school and get to this age
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.560]   where I can play basketball and I never really have
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.080]   except by myself or with the neighbor,
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.900]   just doing crazy shots.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.960]   And they're like, okay, why don't you shoot a free throw?
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.920]   And I'm like, you know, and they're like,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.040]   well, why are you doing that?
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.440]   And I'm like, well, that's, isn't that what you do?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.800]   And I was terrible.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.720]   And I was so bad because I practiced poorly.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.600]   See, when you're six, seven,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   and you bring the ball down here from a rebound,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.940]   it's just like saying to the opponent,
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.660]   here you go, you can have the ball.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.360]   And you're not using your height to your advantage.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.920]   I remember the coach saying,
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.740]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.880]   'cause he couldn't say my last name.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.040]   He said, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.480]   I don't mean a hill of beans.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.000]   And I don't even know what that means,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.100]   but I just know he was angry at me
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.880]   because I kept giving the opponent the basketball.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.400]   And the reason I say that is because I believe today
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.920]   we are in a relationship crisis.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.200]   And I believe the reason we're in a relationship crisis
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.940]   is because we're practicing poorly.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.480]   We are practicing poorly.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.040]   Lean in here because you've gotta give me this.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.700]   As we consider the end goal of marriage
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.240]   to becoming one flesh and running together for a lifetime,
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.160]   our generation, millennials,
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.400]   or whatever you wanna call yourself,
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.920]   we're not getting better at this.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.480]   We're getting married later,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.660]   and those marriages are ending more often.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.800]   The greatest disasters and tragedy of marriages
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.840]   the world has ever seen.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.720]   It seems almost like we should go back
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.200]   to doing something they used to do long ago
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.720]   'cause whatever we're doing today is not working.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.920]   But you haven't given a lot of thought about that.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.360]   You're just gonna continue the model, the process.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.800]   No one here wants to be divorced,
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.420]   and yet half of you will be.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.400]   Half of you.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.360]   Why?
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.440]   Because you're practicing poorly, unbeknownst to you.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.160]   And so this evening I want to talk about
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.280]   poor practices when you're looking for love.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.400]   What are the poor practices that I see in young adults
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.960]   when you are looking for love?
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.680]   And we're gonna address those poor practices
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.340]   with the scriptures, with God's word.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.700]   And if you do these things,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.420]   you either won't find love at all
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.260]   or you won't find love that lasts.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.880]   And we're not only just practicing poorly, friends.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.460]   What's happening is it's the foundation.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.200]   We're learning from the wrong people.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   Our experts are the ones who are most terrible at this.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   The ones that we watch in awe of,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.040]   oh, isn't what they have so beautiful?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.960]   And then we begin to take instruction,
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.980]   that we begin to date like they do
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.320]   to the same end result that they have.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.440]   Let me just kinda explain what I mean by this.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.700]   I watch HGTV.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.980]   And there's this couple on HGTV.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.660]   About a year ago I'm watching and I'm like,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.080]   man, this couple's got it going on.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.260]   It's not Chip and Jojo, that's not who I'm talking about.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.960]   It's this other couple and they're flipping houses
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.700]   and I'm like, what a dream, you know?
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.440]   She's cute and he's attractive
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.580]   and they get to work together
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.740]   and they're making all this money and driving escalades
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.580]   and they get to like flip houses for a living
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.240]   and they're just living the dream
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.000]   and they're laughing and giggling
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.360]   and I'm like, oh man, and I'm tempted to think
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.860]   in my foolishness, like I want that.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.440]   Like maybe Monica and I should just kinda leave
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.680]   this whole ministry thing and just start flipping houses,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.640]   you know, 'cause I want what Tarek and Christina have.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.320]   You know, cute couple.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.740]   But then fast forward, divorced.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.180]   But it's not just them, right?
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.020]   It's not just them.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.880]   There's Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.720]   I know.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.800]   I know, I know, right?
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.360]   He's singing God Gave Me You and Honey Bee.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.200]   Miranda's his honey bee, right?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.160]   And if country music can't hold two together, right?
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.000]   Divorced.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.040]   And not just them, right?
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.920]   Then there's Brad Pitt and who do I wanna say next?
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.100]   I got options, but we'll go Angelina.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.000]   Bradgelina, you know?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.040]   I mean, Mr. and Mrs. Smith voted most beautiful people.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.920]   I mean, they're just out there making great movies.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.760]   Divorced.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.240]   Having kids, adopting kids, no longer together.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.960]   They're teaching us how to date
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.120]   and what it looks like to love.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.920]   And you got Bennifer, we got Ben Affleck
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.680]   and Jennifer Garner just making it happen
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.800]   in the movie scenes.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.140]   Beautiful people, we're watching along like,
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.600]   oh, look what they have, gone, over, done.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.000]   And I'm telling you, like you think, man, it's funny.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.280]   You don't think these are the people telling you
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.800]   how to date, giving you relationship instruction.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.160]   Got Russell Brand and Katy Perry, right?
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.880]   Just, you know, fun and a little bit crazy, right?
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.480]   He's her dark horse.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.760]   Broke up with her in a text message, now hear her roar.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.480]   It's not, it's not going well.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.440]   And I could go, I got a list here in front of me.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.720]   We could go Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore,
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.560]   Gwen Stefani, Gavin Rosdale.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.560]   We could go Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise,
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.680]   just a little crazy.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.840]   We go Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon,
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.560]   Anna Faris and Chris Pratt, Ryan Reynolds and Scarlet,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.280]   I know, I know, guys, I'm sorry.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.600]   I'm sorry, I'm the messenger.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.220]   Ryan Reynolds and Scarlet Johansson.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.500]   Of the 21 seasons of The Bachelor.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.660]   19 heartbreaks, guys.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.220]   These are the ones that are saying,
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.180]   hey, sit down and date like I do.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.020]   And guys, here's the not funny part.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.740]   We're doing it.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.460]   We're learning from the wrong instructors
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.180]   and we're practicing poorly.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:38.340]   And we're gonna be left with the same result,
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.100]   the same heartbreak, the same ending.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.340]   We have a bad example, we practice poorly,
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.620]   then we can't play the game.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.180]   And so I wanna give you five ways
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.260]   I see young adults practice poorly.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.000]   If you do these five things,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.320]   if you wanna stay single or marry poorly,
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.020]   and here's the first one.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.740]   Number one, you hide hurts and habits.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.100]   Hide your hurts and your habits.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.740]   You are practicing poorly
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.660]   if you are hiding your hurts and your habits.
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.340]   And so let me take you back 13 years ago.
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.580]   I married the beautiful, now Monica Pucluta,
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.660]   and we're going on the honeymoon to Playa del Carmen.
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.620]   And we didn't know what to take to Mexico for seven days.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.820]   And so we took six suitcases,
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.140]   lots of luggage, lots of baggage.
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.180]   We take them there to the DFW Airport.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.000]   And remember those long escalators,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.740]   really long escalators, like just go forever.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.900]   And I've got, like she's got one,
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.820]   and I've got five 'cause I'm like showing off,
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.420]   peacocking as the new husband, you know.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.560]   And I'm like, I got this.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.460]   And we get on that escalator,
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.940]   and we get to the top,
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.460]   and one of those suitcases grabs the side of the escalator,
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.860]   the part that's not moving,
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.140]   and he kinda jolts me forward.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.020]   I hit her.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.540]   We tumble down, true story, head over heels
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.260]   from the top of the escalator
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.060]   to the bottom of the escalator.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.980]   I'm laying there.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.700]   Like I can't get up, I'm bleeding.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.460]   There's blood, okay?
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.500]   'Cause I was like trying to keep her safe,
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.060]   and now I'm bleeding, yeah, oh.
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.620]   And I'm bleeding.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.120]   There's blood.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.460]   And here's the deal.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.580]   All that baggage you're hiding,
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.340]   you're gonna take on the honeymoon.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.820]   And it's gonna hurt.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.260]   And it's gonna hurt in the marriage.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.100]   And so what kind of baggage am I talking about?
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.300]   I'm talking about hurts, guys.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.920]   You know right now.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.260]   Are you carrying with you right now a hurt?
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.340]   And are you dealing with that hurt
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.460]   by getting in another relationship?
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.740]   You know somebody broke your heart.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.500]   You look back, you think about him all the time.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   You think about all these, you stalked her on the internet.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.840]   And you know you're messed up.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.220]   And you're just trying to move through life.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.340]   You know that thing,
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.660]   and I don't mean to be so flippant about this at all.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.060]   Guys, listen, I love you.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.700]   I am so for you.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.740]   And I just want you to deal with your hurt.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.400]   And if you think that thing that your uncle did,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.100]   or that guy did, or that time you drank too much,
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.620]   and you said no, but he just kept pushing.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.940]   You think that that's not gonna mess with you,
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.540]   that you're just gonna be able to suppress that,
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.460]   put that up in a closet,
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.500]   lock it up and not have to deal with it.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.920]   You are sadly mistaken.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.060]   You think that you can,
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.100]   maybe it's something that,
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.340]   maybe it's not something you did,
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.700]   but something that,
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.920]   maybe not something that happened to you,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.380]   but something that you were a part of,
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.020]   like an abortion, whether you're male or female.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.060]   You know on that birthday every year,
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.420]   you think back,
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.780]   and you know the hurt that you've suppressed,
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.820]   it's still there.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.060]   And the only way you're going to be able to move forward
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.540]   and find a healthy marriage is if right now, today,
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.920]   in this season, you deal with it.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.720]   You deal with it.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.960]   And it's not just the hurts.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.200]   It's the habits.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.780]   It blows my mind,
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.880]   and I shouldn't because I was the same way,
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.500]   but it blows my mind that some of you think
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.100]   that marriage is going to solve your habit.
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.100]   I've had guys look me in the eyes and say,
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.540]   "Yeah, I'll struggle with masturbation.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.220]   "I'll probably struggle with masturbation until I'm married."
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:18.500]   Friends, you're gonna struggle more when you're married.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.380]   And you're like, "No, I'm not.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.580]   "I'm gonna be having sex all the time."
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.660]   No, you're not.
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.740]   No, you're not.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.000]   See, last week,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.120]   no, that's not the way that it works.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.680]   And what you've done is you've taught yourself a shortcut,
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.880]   and it's not interchangeable.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.400]   You don't just take that shortcut that you've taught yourself
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.240]   and plug in sex and it all transfers.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.900]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.800]   It's never worked that way for nobody.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.360]   It's not gonna work that way for you.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.580]   You don't believe me right now.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.420]   You think, "No, no, I will.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.820]   "No, it won't.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.560]   "Man, I'm gonna struggle with porn until I'm married."
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.540]   No, you're gonna struggle with porn more when you're married.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.440]   That's what's gonna happen.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.680]   You're gonna be married to porn.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.000]   You're gonna be married and a porn addict.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   That's what's gonna happen.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.960]   This is my story.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.560]   You're not gonna be the exception.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.520]   You're not gonna be the first dude to walk down the aisle,
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.600]   the first girl, 'cause I know what your problem to.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.960]   You walk down the aisle, you say, "I do,"
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.840]   and all of a sudden, "Oh, yeah, that addiction
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.320]   "that I fed for the past 16 years, now I'm free from it."
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.980]   No, you're not.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.560]   That's not the way it works.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.400]   So what do you do?
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.280]   You get well.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.060]   You show up here 6.30 p.m. Monday night.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.840]   You stop coming to the porch if you need to.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.000]   You start showing a regen instead.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.480]   Stop coming here.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.000]   If you're listening, you find a Celebrate Recovery
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.120]   or Recovery Ministry or Regeneration in your city,
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.420]   and you go there.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.040]   Maybe it's shelter from the storm.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.240]   Some of you, you're like, "I've heard it.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.240]   "I've thought about it."
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.200]   Hey, hey, hey, stop thinking about it.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.360]   Stop thinking about it.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.180]   Now's your time.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.020]   That's why you're here.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.560]   It's why God, in his mercy, is speaking these words
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.840]   right now, or at least allowing you
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.340]   to hear these words right now.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.660]   So that you'd act on them.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.580]   You deal with your habits.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:07.500]   Some of you, you drink when you're stressed.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.260]   You know what comes with marriage?
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.140]   Stress.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.340]   You're gonna drink more.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.660]   You deal with that right now.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.380]   Second Peter two, verse 19 says,
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.540]   "People are slaves to whatever has mastered them."
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.060]   If you're a slave, start with, "God, I'm a slave.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.500]   "I'm a slave, I can't stop."
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.780]   How do you know if you're a slave?
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.460]   Listen, look backwards.
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.620]   In the past month, have you looked at porn?
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.020]   Have you masturbated in the past month?
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.760]   Have you been drunk in the past month?
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.380]   In the past 30 days, is that where you've been?
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.460]   If so, start with, "I've got a problem.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.320]   "I need help.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.860]   "I've gotta deal with this baggage."
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.680]   In regards to hurts, it may be forgiving someone.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.160]   You're like, "Man, you don't know how I've been hurt."
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.280]   I've hurt, you're not gonna surprise me.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.360]   And I'm telling you, God calls you to forgive people.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.760]   First John one, verse five says, "God is light.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.600]   "In the God that we worship, there's no darkness at all.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.360]   "If we claim to have fellowship with him
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.560]   "and yet walk in darkness, we lie
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.720]   "and we do not live out the truth.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.360]   "But if we walk in the light,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   "if we're known as he is in the light,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.280]   "we have fellowship with one another
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.880]   "and the blood of his son, Jesus,
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.080]   "purifies us from all sin."
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.080]   What am I asking you to do?
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.760]   That hurt and that habit that you're hiding,
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   to bring it to the light, to tell someone tonight
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.840]   and say, "Hey, I need help."
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.680]   Will you hold me accountable to taking the next step
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.600]   in forgiving or recovering or getting help?
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.720]   Will you help me?
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.680]   Because I've been too afraid.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.760]   I've been hiding this.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.160]   I've been thinking I can deal with it on my own
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.000]   or I don't have to deal with it at all.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.280]   Don't hide hurts and habits.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.640]   Heal from hurts and deal with habits.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.600]   Write that down.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.040]   Don't hide hurts and habits.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.480]   Heal from hurts and deal with habits.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.640]   The next thing you do if you wanna practice poorly
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.120]   is you stay selfish.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.160]   Number two, stay selfish.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.320]   You are practicing poorly if you are doing things
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.000]   that allow you to stay selfish.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.320]   Are you right now feeding selfishness?
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.000]   You gotta think about this one.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.760]   How do we feed selfishness?
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.080]   We live alone.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.200]   That's one way is like, man, I just want the freedom
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.240]   to do whatever I wanna do.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.280]   When I wanna do it, I'm gonna store up money
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.360]   so that I can go somewhere.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.640]   When I wanna go there, I wanna buy what I wanna buy,
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.760]   eat what I wanna eat.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.020]   You feed your preferences.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.320]   I've said it before.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.920]   Preferences can rob you of paradise.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.240]   When you start feeding your preferences, which is common,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.720]   everyone's teaching you to do so,
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.880]   you are feeding selfishness
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.240]   and there's no room for selfishness in marriage.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.400]   And you say, well, what can I do?
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.160]   One thing you can do is you can get a roommate.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.320]   You can get a really dysfunctional roommate.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.440]   That will prepare you for marriage, okay?
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.680]   Get a roommate that leaves their clothes everywhere,
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.280]   all over the floor, and doesn't do the dishes.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.960]   Some of you are like leaning over to your roommate
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.560]   and say, you're welcome right now, okay?
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.720]   Do that.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.140]   That's the kind of roommate Monica has.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.040]   You'll figure it out in a minute.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.800]   And so I don't wanna lose you,
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.800]   'cause I said get a dysfunctional roommate.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.480]   You think, oh, he doesn't mean that.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.520]   No, no, I really do.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.280]   I mean, you're gonna have a dysfunctional roommate
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.160]   for the rest of your life
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.680]   'cause you're gonna have a human roommate.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.320]   If you wanna get married, if you get married,
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.440]   you're gonna find yourself with another human being
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.580]   and they're gonna be different than you
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.480]   and that's gonna create dysfunction.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.680]   And so it's a beautiful thing
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.920]   when you can learn to resolve conflict right now,
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.720]   when you don't just kinda go your separate ways.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.480]   You sit in the living room and you work through it.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.960]   You look each other in the eyes
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.880]   and you work through it in a biblical way.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.220]   That honors God and it's training you.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:56.600]   It's training you for future relationships.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.960]   We even date selfish.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.400]   Like I hear this, I'll ask people,
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   what do you love about him?
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.300]   Well, I love the way he makes me feel.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.480]   It's a selfish response.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.400]   What about when you don't feel that anymore?
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.880]   Are you still gonna love him?
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.160]   What about when he doesn't make you feel that way anymore?
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.680]   And so then what we do is we jump into something
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.120]   because of the way it makes us feel
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.200]   and then we jump out of it when we don't feel it anymore
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.440]   and then we jump into something else
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.680]   because of the way it makes us feel
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.480]   and then we jump out of it when we don't feel it anymore.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.240]   Is that training for marriage or training for divorce?
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.880]   It's training for divorce.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.320]   You've gone to a university for divorce.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.380]   Like if you look backwards
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.080]   and you see lots of relationships, okay,
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.160]   then you gotta start with,
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.880]   man, I've got a really bad track record.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.840]   I can't choose 'em.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.240]   Everyone I've chosen has ended.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.600]   And so what am I waiting for?
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.800]   And I've talked to people and it's like you're waiting,
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.280]   it's almost like you think marriage is like the flu.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.360]   Like I'm just gonna catch it.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.520]   Like it's gonna happen to me.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.960]   Like I'm gonna be somewhere
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.720]   and love's just gonna come upon me.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.880]   And it's not that way.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:05.280]   It's something that you intentionally seek out
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.440]   as a follower of Christ.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.540]   As you seek out Christ,
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.600]   you seek out the things that Christ creates in his people.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.460]   As you look within his people.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.880]   And so how do you do that?
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.020]   You serve.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.460]   How do you kill selfishness?
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.300]   You serve.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.060]   So you're listening right now, you're hearing my words,
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.060]   and here's a simple question.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.980]   Are you serving?
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.460]   Are you serving in the church?
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.500]   Is there a part of your week that's designated
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.220]   you going somewhere that you don't have to be
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.660]   except for you willfully, willingly,
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.820]   you are there donating your time,
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.660]   giving of yourself,
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.940]   pointing out this is tremendous training for marriage.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.740]   That you are the most,
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.380]   you are the engine of the church,
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.100]   the most powerful force that the world has ever seen.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.500]   Young adults, you are the engine.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.100]   How are you doing?
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.720]   Are you the first one there,
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.380]   willing to set out chairs,
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.620]   willing to stay late,
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.700]   willing to lead,
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.840]   willing to find gaps
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.340]   and not just point them out like a critic,
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.580]   but stand in them?
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.000]   You're serving.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.640]   You know, I don't know if you are.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.080]   Some of you, you are.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.800]   Some of you, we get to serve here together.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.480]   But if you're not, friend,
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.520]   because I love you, I urge you
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.400]   to serve, serve within the body.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.400]   Don't stay selfish.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.340]   Serve selflessly.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.740]   The scripture says in Ephesians 5,
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.200]   21, "Submit to one another."
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.040]   It's talking about marriage.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.840]   "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.000]   "as wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.240]   "as you do to the Lord."
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.400]   And then to this, it says to the husbands,
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.440]   verse 25, "Love your wives just as Christ loved the church
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.240]   "and gave himself up for her."
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.040]   It says in verse 28, "In the same way,
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.580]   "husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.640]   "He who loves his wife loves himself."
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.480]   This is such a high calling
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.080]   that you would love some woman like Christ,
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.840]   loved the church and bled out for her,
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.080]   gave his life for her, set aside his own desires
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.080]   for the betterment and the salvation of the church.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:11.920]   This is crazy.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.720]   If you did this, the world would change.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.120]   And it starts with just small steps of selflessness.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   There's no room for selfishness in marriage.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.560]   Let me tell you how this verse applies to me.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.240]   Love your wife as you love your own body.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.160]   Man, I get in bed, like right now in this fall,
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.800]   like cold last night.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.640]   Love it.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.460]   Get under those covers.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.520]   We got like this foam mattress,
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.720]   like this Tempur-Pedic thing.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.360]   It's like a knockoff Tempur-Pedic.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.680]   It's amazing.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.320]   And I get all snugly under there.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.680]   I like it cold, you know, and all comfortable
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.760]   and just like right about to catch those Zs, you know?
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.680]   And then Monica, my amazing wife,
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   says, "Babe, are you sleeping?"
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.360]   I wanna be like, you know, crickets, you know, like,
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.400]   but no, babe.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.360]   What's up?
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.600]   I'm cold.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.320]   That's interesting.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.720]   No, no, you don't say that's interesting.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.840]   You get your hiney up and you get to that thermostat
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.960]   and you change that thermostat
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.360]   because you know what I do when I'm cold?
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.480]   I change the thermostat.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.640]   And so if she's cold and I'm gonna love her
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.280]   like I love my own body,
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.800]   I'm gonna be finally aware,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.520]   acutely aware of what her desires and her needs are
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.040]   in any moments that I can meet them
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.580]   and put my own aside for her.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.080]   That's where you say, oh.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.800]   Blake Shelton and Miranda,
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.760]   he didn't do that.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.520]   Don't stay selfish, serve selflessly.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.360]   Write that down.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.240]   Don't stay selfish, serve selflessly.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   It's amazing time to serve within the church right now.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.680]   Number three, the things that we're doing
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.560]   as we practice poorly,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.600]   we're looking for love in all the wrong places.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.160]   Are you right now, look,
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.840]   do you look for love in the wrong places?
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.160]   You are practicing poorly
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.480]   if you are looking in the wrong places
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.220]   because what you find in the wrong places
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.320]   are the wrong people.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.360]   And you get stuck in the wrong relationship.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.360]   Some of you, you've done this.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.040]   You're thinking back right now and you're like,
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.320]   oh yeah, I met him there
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.440]   and yeah, that didn't work out so well.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.220]   I hate when people tell me so often,
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.560]   they're like, man, I just don't know where to meet someone.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.920]   Man, JP, it's so hard.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.440]   Like, where do you go?
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.400]   And so then they just resolve,
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.420]   they're like, man, I'm just gonna go to the bars
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.600]   and the clubs, you know,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.020]   because I hope that there's a good person there.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.880]   And I'm just like, man, the amazing wives
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.080]   and the amazing husbands don't hang out
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.920]   at the clubs and the bars.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.580]   Like, you're stacking the odds against you
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.680]   and you're thinking, no, no, no,
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.740]   they might because I'm there and I'm a good person.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.600]   Maybe not, but let's just say,
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.540]   let's just give you the benefit of the doubt
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.440]   and say you are, okay?
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.360]   So maybe, maybe out of the 2,700 people there at the club,
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.560]   you know, five clubs in one,
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.160]   wherever you're at or standing at the bar,
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.000]   maybe you find the one who's there
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.460]   doing some sort of bartender evangelism,
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.120]   like they just got some kind of ministry that they started
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.480]   that they're going bar to bar
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.320]   and just sharing the gospel, you know?
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.360]   They're like, hey, I'll take a, you know,
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   a virgin margarita and by the way,
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.080]   did you know Jesus was born of a virgin?
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.660]   And they're just sharing the gospel
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.080]   and you're gonna find them
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.480]   and they're gonna be your husband or your wife
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.440]   and it's gonna be beautiful
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.080]   and you guys are gonna tell your story, but probably not.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.320]   Probably not.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.440]   Probably what you're gonna find in the bars and the club
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.980]   are selfish people, narcissistic people who are shopping
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.140]   out of desperation, hoping to find someone
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.380]   that's had one too many drinks
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.660]   that they might be able to convince
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.100]   to spend some time with them.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.480]   And I just would urge you,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.420]   I'd urge you to look among God's people.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.340]   You have the benefit of that
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.500]   just because of where you are right now
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.160]   and I'm not saying everyone here are God's people,
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.920]   but you know, 2 Corinthians 6, 14,
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.800]   do not be unequally yoked to unbelievers.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.000]   We've made that abundantly clear,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.900]   but you don't want just somebody who's like,
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.080]   check the box Christian.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.680]   You want someone who is radically running hard after Jesus,
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.080]   like their entire life is focused
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.400]   on the trajectory of Jesus.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.040]   They're all in the radical,
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.820]   they're thinking about, hey, where are we going?
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.420]   They're serving in the ways that I said
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.720]   and they're going on international trips
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.620]   and they're caring for the widows and the orphans
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.480]   and their money is God's
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.320]   and everything they have is God's
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.600]   and they're just all in.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.520]   And if you want to find that person
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:00.440]   and have lots of babies and make disciples,
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.740]   that's just the scripture, guys.
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.500]   That's what he says.
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.440]   That's God's plan.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.400]   That's the first great commission
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.840]   that God's people would find each other
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.340]   and be fruitful and multiply.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:16.120]   Proverbs 13, verse 20 says,
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.640]   "Walk with the wise and become wise,
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.080]   "for a companion of fools suffers harm."
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.640]   In the clubs and the bars,
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.120]   you're stacking the odds against you.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.600]   Why do we do this?
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.900]   Because you watch the movies
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.360]   and that's where they meet each other.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.240]   Would you please stop taking relationship advice
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.380]   from the Kardashians?
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.760]   It's not gonna go well for you.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.820]   It's gonna go as it has for them.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.440]   First Corinthians 15, 33 says,
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.300]   "Do not be misled, bad company corrupts good character."
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.280]   And so if you hang out with the right people
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.320]   in the right places, can you hear this?
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.840]   That's half the battle.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.600]   Like that makes it so much easier.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.760]   If you just did that one thing tonight,
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.760]   you just started hanging out in the right places
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.920]   with the right people,
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.680]   you've at least increased your odds
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.560]   of bumping into the right person.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.920]   It actually does two things.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.040]   One, it allows you to consistently
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.920]   be around good prospects.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.160]   You're looking to marry someone
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.640]   completely sold out for Jesus.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.040]   And so you're hanging out with people
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.560]   who are completely sold out for Jesus.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.600]   That helps you.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.080]   The other thing that it does,
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.640]   is it allows the church to get to know you,
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.760]   to protect you, to care for you,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.140]   and then to point out prospects to you.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.360]   That's why we are so, not why,
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.600]   but one of the reasons we hammer this idea of community
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.640]   that every single person here
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.120]   would on a weekly basis meet with a small group of people
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.120]   that you are going through the scriptures with
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.640]   and holding each other accountable.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.840]   We call that community that you would have a small group.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.760]   Listen, your church is not 2,700 people,
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.000]   4,700 people, 5,000 people, or even 100 people.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.520]   Your church should be about six to 10 people
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.540]   who will help you make rent when you need to,
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.420]   who will care for you when you've lost your job,
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.600]   who will bear burdens with you
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.040]   and celebrate victories with you.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.220]   And they'll say, "Hey man, he's no good for you.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.040]   "Hey, she seems awesome."
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.840]   And they'll help you when your heart starts going crazy
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.200]   and you can't think straight.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.800]   They'll help you think straight.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.640]   And what they do, in Psalm 1:4,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.600]   it says their friends and their family
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.600]   looked upon their loved
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.740]   and praised it more than the party.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.420]   They look at two people and they're like,
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.620]   man, that just makes sense.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.220]   This weekend in that chapel,
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.600]   a couple days ago I did a wedding.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.700]   It was an arranged marriage.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.100]   You guys know what that means, arranged marriage?
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.820]   Yeah, I did an arranged marriage.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.700]   Probably not what you're thinking though.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.340]   This is how it was arranged.
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:01.480]   She lived in Dallas, he lived in Fort Worth.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.980]   Some guys just kept saying the same thing,
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.260]   man, y'all need to meet each other.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.580]   They're both in the church, both plugged in,
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.960]   both members, both serving,
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.520]   both under the authority of the elders.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.920]   And people kept bumping into him like,
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.200]   hey man, y'all should, have you met Morgan?
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.800]   Hey Morgan, have you met Andy?
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.200]   And then another girl, hey listen,
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.600]   have you met Morgan, have you met Andy?
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.080]   And then another girl to Andy,
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.080]   have you met my friend in Dallas, Morgan?
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.320]   Man, y'all just, I think 'cause you both serve,
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.560]   I think y'all belong together.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.160]   And then he's on an international trip in Ethiopia
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.400]   and two girls come up to him and he's like,
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.560]   okay, Andy, we got the perfect girl.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.160]   You're not gonna believe, so her name is Morgan.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.180]   And he's like, oh gosh, God, I get it.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.480]   You know, I hear ya, loud and clear.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.920]   Fine, and comes to Dallas, hey, I'm Andy, will you marry me?
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.600]   No, it didn't work that way, but it almost did.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.040]   It almost did.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.600]   And there we are, and you know what it was?
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.320]   It was a this just makes sense wedding.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.020]   And that's the only weddings I do.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.000]   You want me to marry you?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.660]   Like the only weddings I do are this just makes sense.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:05.000]   Like man, you guys, y'all, yeah, I can see this.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.240]   It's an arranged marriage.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.860]   That God used the body to bring those two together.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.960]   Some of you need to hear right now,
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.020]   change your playmates in your playground.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:20.180]   Don't look in the wrong places.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.840]   Look only among God's people.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.220]   Write that down.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.620]   Don't look in the wrong places.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.420]   Look only among God's people.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.080]   The fourth way, you practice poorly,
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.620]   you set shallow standards.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:39.320]   You are practicing poorly if you've set shallow standards.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.160]   What do I mean by shallow standards?
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.800]   I mean, I've heard it all.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.940]   I love dogs, like he's gotta love dogs.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.600]   Like let me tell you something,
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.140]   you are gonna marry someone who hates dogs.
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.880]   That's just the way it works, okay?
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.660]   That is what's going to happen.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.800]   All right, and I've heard it, man, she's gotta be blonde.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.760]   I've heard he's gotta be tall.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.520]   You know, whatever those silly standards are,
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.880]   he's gotta love the walking dead or whatever,
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.040]   I don't know where you're at.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.920]   Like we come up with these crazy things, okay?
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.200]   I like, man, I love this story.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.640]   There was this couple, well, they weren't a couple,
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.560]   there were two individuals, a male and a female,
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.680]   serving here at the porch,
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.280]   and her and her community group, they made a list.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.640]   And so they made a list of deal breakers.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.240]   And so she wrote down some deal breakers,
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.300]   I'll show it to you.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.600]   This is the non-negotiables, these are deal breakers.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.200]   Her first one on there is tattoos, okay?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.440]   If he has tattoos, that's a deal breaker.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.000]   The number two is if he's not a believer, okay?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.640]   I'm just gonna go ahead and give you some free advice,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.720]   that's a bad order.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.320]   Heavy drinker, quick temper, controlling,
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.080]   these are all deal breakers if he has tattoos.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.460]   Let me show you her husband here, they're married now, okay?
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.640]   [congregation laughing]
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.380]   That's my boy Kenny, that's not a shirt, okay?
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:57.480]   Brother's tatted up, and God's just laughing, okay?
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.680]   God's like, hey, and so some of you are like,
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.680]   okay, it's only this race, no kids, I can't have kids.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.800]   Listen, you're like, really, that's not good?
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.640]   I can't do that?
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.160]   Here's what I tell you, care about what God cares about.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.720]   I mean, have standards rooted in Scripture.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:25.440]   Have your standards rooted in Scripture.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.080]   Remember when I said preference robs you of paradise?
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.560]   Have your standards rooted in Scripture.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.040]   Let me give you a good Scripture.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.800]   I taught on this, it's actually the number one
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.840]   listen to podcast on the porch.live
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.280]   called Identifying the One, and it was this text.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.080]   It says, it's the text, don't let anyone look down on you
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.400]   because you're young, it's 1 Timothy 4:12.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.600]   It says this, but find someone, I'm saying,
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.940]   but find someone who sets an example for believers
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.680]   in the way they talk, in the way they act,
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:01.600]   in the way they love, in their faith, and in their purity.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.520]   You want a good list straight from the Scriptures?
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.680]   Here's some non-negotiables.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.000]   I wanna find someone, I wanna inspect the way they talk,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.320]   I wanna watch the way they act,
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.080]   I wanna watch the way they love others,
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.560]   I wanna observe their faith, and I wanna know their purity.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.760]   That's a fantastic list straight from the Scripture.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.480]   So set standards that are rooted in Scripture on the who,
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.840]   but not just the who, how about the how?
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.920]   You can right now, what can you do right now?
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.760]   You can make a list from the Scriptures
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   on who you want to marry, and also how you want to date.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.280]   And so like, what do you mean by that, right?
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.560]   You can date intentionally for marriage.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.760]   We don't date for fun, we don't date for pleasure.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.500]   A date is an interview.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.880]   It's you trying to find someone
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.440]   that you're gonna spend the rest of your life with.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.600]   You're interviewing them.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.800]   We don't play games, right?
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.640]   Games are fake.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.120]   You don't hang up on somebody
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.560]   to see if they'll call you back,
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.520]   or not respond to their text
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.200]   just to make them wait a little bit.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.560]   Romans 12, nine says, "Love must be sincere."
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:04.040]   Games create fake relationships, that's what they do.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.440]   You can just be sincere.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.640]   You can say what you mean.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.280]   You can talk about where this is going.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.120]   You can be intentional.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.180]   And then you date with absolute purity.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.320]   Talked about that last week.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.840]   First Corinthians six, verse 18 through 20 says,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.120]   "Flee from sexual immorality.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.340]   "All other sins a person commits are outside the body,
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.400]   "but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body."
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.380]   It says this, listen, "Do you not know that your body
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.540]   "is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you,
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.940]   "whom you've received from God?
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.920]   "You are not your own.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.680]   "You've been bought by a price.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.180]   "Therefore, honor God with your body."
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.160]   Okay, what does this mean?
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.860]   Anybody follow the Harvey Weinstein thing?
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.280]   The producer in Hollywood accused of sexual assault
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.440]   and rape and, did you guys catch this?
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.300]   It's interesting if you didn't, you know,
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.400]   watch the news every now and then.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.600]   Ben Affleck, Ben Affleck spoke up and he just said,
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.060]   "Hey, that's appalling, you know, what he did.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.020]   "That's crazy."
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.660]   And then what happened is someone said,
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.560]   "Hey, Ben, I just wanna remind you,
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.320]   "do you remember when you groped Hillary
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.540]   "on Total Request Live?
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.440]   "You grabbed her breast, you remember that?"
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.400]   And then Hillary comes back and says,
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.880]   "Hey, I remember that.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.900]   "I was a child, right?
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.880]   "Hillary Burton."
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.160]   And now Ben Affleck's caught all this bad rep
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:43.220]   because he grabbed this girl's breast.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.040]   And let me ask you a question.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.360]   What's wrong with that?
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.900]   Why is that not okay that he did that?
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:36:00.100]   I hope what you're thinking is because it's not his body.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.560]   That doesn't belong to him.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.960]   He can't just do what he wants to with it.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.760]   It's not his.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.240]   And here's my newsflash for you.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.760]   It's not hers either.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.440]   It's God.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.080]   Do you not know that your bodies are temples
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.400]   of the Holy Spirit who is in you,
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.600]   whom you've received from God?
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.840]   You are not your own.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.000]   You are not your own.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.160]   You are not your own.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.540]   You've been bought by a price.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.760]   That price was Christ.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.460]   It was Jesus's blood.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:29.320]   Therefore, honor God with that body.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.600]   It's his body.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.280]   So you think, "Well, I can do whatever I want to with it
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.280]   "because it's mine."
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.120]   No, it's not.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.320]   You got it on loan.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.340]   And so before you put your hand up her shirt,
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.760]   why don't you ask for permission from her father?
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.960]   That's a game changer.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.600]   Before you get all handsy, right?
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.040]   Before you lay down on the couch,
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.960]   you're watching a movie,
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.280]   before you go there, a little makeout session,
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.480]   "Hey, God, are you okay with this?"
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.320]   Man, before we go there,
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.000]   let's just spend a little bit of time in the scripture.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.080]   Make sure it's a buzzkill.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.120]   Don't have shallow standards.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.360]   Have standards that are rooted in scripture.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.480]   On the who and the how, write it down.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.520]   Don't have shallow standards.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.280]   Have standards rooted in scripture.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.960]   Number five, you wanna practice poorly,
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.140]   you passively pursue Christ.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:38.180]   You are practicing poorly
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.100]   if you are passively pursuing Jesus.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:47.860]   Some of you, man, you gotta self-identify right now
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.260]   'cause this one's important.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.460]   I'm not saying you gotta raise your hand.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.340]   I'm just saying in your mind,
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:54.500]   you gotta say, "Okay, that's where I'm at."
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.580]   Some of you, you look at Jesus like he's a hobby.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.220]   Like your whole week comes and goes
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.220]   and Tuesday comes, you're like, "Oh yeah, the porch.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.380]   "Man, yeah, let me go give me some Jesus."
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:12.100]   He's like your walking buddy, me and Jesus.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.060]   And you live your whole life
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.060]   and you just kinda add Jesus to it.
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.760]   It was never meant to be that way.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.700]   You are not walking buddies with Jesus.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.300]   You are running hard after Christ.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.700]   Friends, if you're like, "Man, I don't know how to do this.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.300]   "Do I wanna be hot or cold or lukewarm?"
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.300]   Listen, you go all in.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.940]   Listen, if you hear me, I want you to be radical, sold out.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.800]   If you need, you're like, "Well, how do I do that?
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.100]   "I don't wanna sell everything I have."
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.020]   Sell everything you have if that's what it means for you.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.980]   You move, you're like, "Well, I'm gonna move
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.820]   "to a hut in Africa."
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.300]   Sure, man, if he calls you to get on a plane.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.020]   Okay, I'm not kidding.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.620]   Like you go all in.
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.140]   So what, you want me to share the gospel
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.060]   with everybody I work with?
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.860]   Everybody, every single person you work with.
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.380]   Tell them all about Jesus.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.580]   You're not gonna get up there
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.300]   and God's gonna be like, "Man, I'm just disappointed
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.660]   "'cause you were just a little too zealous.
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.260]   "You told one too many people about me."
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.940]   That's not gonna happen.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.260]   You go all in.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.420]   There's nothing that you will give up down here,
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.140]   nothing you will sacrifice for his name
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.700]   that you will regret, not one thing.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.500]   You go 100%.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:22.660]   And some of you, you've not bought into the faith
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.260]   of Ben and Jennifer or Brad and Angelina.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.940]   You bought into the faith of American Christianity
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.700]   and you are completely okay having lukewarm Christianity
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.460]   and it is not okay.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.700]   It's not Christianity.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:40.580]   It's not Christianity of any kind.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.180]   He says you're neither hot nor cold,
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.780]   so I spit you out of my mouth.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.500]   And I'm not fear mongering right now.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.420]   I'm not trying to scare you into the faith that won't work.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.060]   I'm trying to get you to examine your life
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.900]   just to say, you know what, self-identify in your mind.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.260]   Am I all in with Jesus?
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.300]   Did I wake up thinking about what he gave for me
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.500]   on the cross?
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.620]   Or am I beat down by my sin?
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.300]   Or am I lost in the world?
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.380]   Or is marriage such an idol for me
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.260]   that Christ is in the backseat?
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:15.820]   He says, Hebrews chapter 12, verses one and two,
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.460]   therefore, since we are surrounded
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.200]   by such a great cloud of witnesses,
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.820]   the heroes of the faith, those who've gone before us,
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.660]   other brothers and sisters who love Jesus,
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.480]   let us throw off everything that hinders us.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.860]   Let us deal with our hurts and our habits that hinder us
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.220]   and the sin that so easily entangles us
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.500]   and let us run with perseverance.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:38.140]   The race marks out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.180]   not just the beginner of our faith,
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.340]   the pioneer of our faith or the starter of our faith,
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.100]   but the perfecter and the finisher of our faith.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.060]   The one who says it is finished,
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.420]   the one who gave his life for us.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.580]   Let us run hard after him.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.900]   And what happens, right?
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.280]   This is what you do is you live your life and you run.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.220]   You wake up and you run and you're running a race
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.300]   and you're serving.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.380]   And somebody says, hey, the church needs this.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.580]   You say, I got it.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.220]   And all of your resources are his and you're running.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.140]   And we're gonna go to Haiti, I'm in.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.780]   We're gonna go to Ethiopia, I'm in.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.780]   Hey, we need people to serve over here, I'm in.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.380]   And you're running and you're at the porch on Tuesdays
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.900]   and reaching on Mondays and church on Sundays.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.260]   And you're just running the race.
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.860]   And as you get down the track, you look beside you
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.740]   and you start to see the same people.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.080]   Oh, we were in Ethiopia together.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.100]   We were in Haiti together.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.900]   Oh yeah, last Tuesday, we were playing broomball.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.100]   Oh, you did that porch thing.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.500]   Oh yeah, I was serving there too.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.620]   Oh, I see you again.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:32.980]   And you just start seeing the same people
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.860]   and you look back and you say, hey,
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.520]   you wanna run forever with me?
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:44.000]   And they say yes.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.340]   And that's what it looks like.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:54.540]   Hey, you just wanna keep, we've been running towards Christ.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.820]   You wanna keep going?
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.020]   You wanna just keep going?
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.020]   They're like, we can keep going.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.180]   Yeah, let's keep going.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.100]   You keep going.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:11.980]   And so you throw off everything that entangles you,
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.560]   the hurts and habits.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.540]   You serve and you kill selfishness.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:20.180]   You run with Jesus' people, the great witnesses.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.980]   And you commit to only looking for a partner
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.540]   who is running hard after him.
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.020]   The point of this message
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:35.100]   is that if you're here and you're waiting to get married,
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.900]   you don't have to wait.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.460]   You're not just waiting.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:40.740]   Hear me clearly.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.780]   Every single thing that I said tonight,
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.060]   you can begin to do today.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.180]   It's preparing.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.940]   It's not just waiting.
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.180]   It's preparing.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.120]   And it's a really tough message to give
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.620]   because some of you are gonna take this
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.260]   and try to create a formula and say,
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.380]   well, if I do these five things,
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.540]   then God has to give me this.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.740]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.140]   You may do these five things,
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.100]   walk outside and get hit by a meteor.
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.000]   That may happen.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.500]   I'm just saying, man, I don't know what he has for you.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   I have no idea.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.260]   Man, that gets me more emails than just about anything.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.940]   You're telling me, God, if I have a desire for marriage
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.220]   that it's not promised to me?
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.980]   There's nothing promised to you except for God himself.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:22.780]   Can I tell you something?
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.620]   Some of you are disappointed by that.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.380]   It's just 'cause you don't understand.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:33.040]   And others of you, and particularly you gentlemen,
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:38.120]   you need to hear, stop being passive.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.460]   You need to go through this list and you say,
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.300]   man, am I good?
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.280]   Like if I've dealt with my hurts and my habits
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.580]   and I'm serving and I'm in the church
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.540]   and I'm killing selfish,
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.820]   I mean, you need to turn to someone
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.280]   to your right or your left and say,
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.520]   will you spend the rest of your life with me?
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.460]   Or start with coffee?
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.960]   I mean, whatever works for you, you know?
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.100]   But you need to move, you need to act.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.180]   And one of my fears in saying that
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.580]   is some of you unhealthy men,
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.380]   you're gonna hear that and take that as permission to act.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.140]   And I hope you get to a place where you're like,
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.340]   man, I'm gonna get well.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.820]   But if you're here, man,
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.140]   and you're running hard after Christ
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.220]   and you're doing these things and you wanna be married,
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.220]   start by finding a godly woman
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:22.200]   and asking her to spend time with you.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.320]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:34.380]   All of those celebrities, you know,
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.260]   I mean, you could look at what they have in common.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.540]   They had their greatest passion in common,
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.800]   be it music or acting or whatever,
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.180]   but it wasn't enough.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:48.900]   I mean, they had incredible chemistry and shared interests,
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.300]   but it wasn't, they're beautiful.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.960]   I mean, we could go down the list.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.040]   They're all very attractive.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.120]   It wasn't enough.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:01.200]   There's gotta be something more to hold you with someone.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.680]   I've done about 30 weddings, okay,
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.640]   about 30 weddings in ministry.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.880]   And of those 30 weddings, I've done about 15,
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.080]   Monica and I have done about 15 of the two-on-two counseling
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.720]   and everyone we sit in our living room
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.760]   and we counsel before the wedding,
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:17.960]   you know, we meet with them several times
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.520]   and they take a test.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.880]   It's called the prepare test.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.920]   It's to prepare you.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.040]   And in that test, we can see, you know,
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.720]   where they need to prepare, you know,
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.040]   and we can ask them good questions around that.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.260]   And it seems like of the 15 people we've met with,
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.460]   they've all missed the same questions.
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.960]   And it's all around these rose-colored glasses
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.480]   and the expectations of marriage.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.960]   And it's just gonna be so different
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:41.800]   than what they think.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.720]   Every single one of them, to a couple,
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.120]   has missed the same questions, some of the same questions.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.980]   And I just reflected on that today
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.640]   and I thought about those 15 to 30 couples
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.180]   and I thought about what they've been through
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.620]   since I've done that wedding.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.340]   Some of them have been laid off.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:03.020]   One of them moved, the couple moved to another city,
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.300]   bought a house, and the first week they were there,
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.420]   they lost their job.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:11.860]   They got, some of them struggled with infertility.
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.320]   They thought they'd get married and then have kids
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.160]   and then they couldn't.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.600]   One of them had, got pregnant, carried the child
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.100]   to full term and lost the baby.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.520]   Another one lost a child at 16 weeks.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.480]   They struggled with miscarriages.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.400]   Some of them have gotten cancer.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.000]   I was on the phone with one of them today.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.740]   His wife had a double mastectomy.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:38.320]   That was about a week after her mother passed away,
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.080]   dealing with cancer.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.520]   You don't know what the future holds.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:50.280]   And so when I talk in terms of practicing poorly
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.040]   and preparing, it's not just for marriage, it's for life.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.840]   I have no idea if God has marriage for you or not,
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.800]   but I do know that today you can begin to prepare
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.380]   for whatever he has for you tomorrow.
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.120]   So don't hide hurts and habits,
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.160]   heal from hurts and deal with habits.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.720]   Don't stay selfish, serve selflessly.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.640]   Don't look in the wrong places, only look among God's people
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.000]   and don't have shallow standards,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.440]   have standards rooted in scripture.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.200]   Don't passively pursue Christ, passionately pursue Christ.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:33.960]   I think we all just, at the end of the day,
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.100]   we wanna be chosen.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.760]   Think back to me in basketball.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.360]   Like I can remember just standing there, the lineup
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.360]   and it's like I'll take him, I'll take him,
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.520]   I'll take him, I'll take him,
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.800]   until I'm there all by myself.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.600]   And it's extra embarrassing when you're like
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.480]   the tallest guy there by a foot.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.880]   They're like, nobody wants the tall guy?
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.440]   I think that's our fear, right?
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:01.360]   And like we wanna be, like we want someone to say,
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.960]   man, I know you, like everything about you,
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.920]   the way you giggle and the weird way you fold the towels
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.280]   and I love it, it's so cute.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.720]   The thing you do with your nose
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.200]   and the way you comb your hair and it's amazing.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.000]   Everything about you and we just say,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.440]   of all the people in the world, I choose you.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.460]   Before you leave here tonight,
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.340]   I want you to know God did that.
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:31.960]   He took you pornographers and legalists,
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:40.100]   adulterers, struggle with masturbation,
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:45.140]   alcoholics, drug users, self-righteous.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:52.940]   He takes you and he cleans you up, cost him his life,
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.420]   cost him everything, man.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:00.860]   This is really humbling to think he, God,
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:05.260]   has to take you and wash you, bathe you in his blood.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.220]   He cleans you up and he purchases you.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:14.540]   It's as though he grabs you by the face and he says,
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:16.580]   you're mine, you belong to me
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.460]   and I'm gonna spend forever with you, forever with you.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.140]   In the next 70 years, I don't know what you get
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.780]   to experience but I know that if you've trusted in Christ
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.400]   his death and resurrection for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.200]   you get to spend forever with God.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.420]   Friends, when did that stop being enough?
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:38.040]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:43.040]   When did it start having to be that and something else?
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:49.060]   Telling you, in a thousand years,
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.620]   a million years, a billion years,
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:55.020]   that's all that's gonna matter, that God chose you.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:58.180]   Father, I just wanna thank you.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.560]   I pray that that truth, would you help, please,
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.500]   that truth hit our hearts in a new way.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.020]   Help us to believe it.
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:13.560]   Father, thank you for sending your son, Jesus,
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:21.060]   purchasing ourselves to you,
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:28.120]   promising us forever with you and your kingdom.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:34.440]   God, as we sing now, how amazing you are
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.140]   and how great is your love, would you fix in our hearts
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:42.420]   that it's enough, that we are yours and you are enough.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.260]   Would you fix that in our hearts right now, God, please?
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:50.620]   In the name of your son, Jesus Christ, amen.
