[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:28.440]   - Alright, what's up guys?
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.160]   Welcome, everybody joining us online and live
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.240]   in all the other Porch locations.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.460]   That's right, if you didn't just hear,
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.300]   we are live streaming from Houston, Texas,
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.840]   which is a first for us and Porch Houston.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.400]   Good to be back, man.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.720]   How fun.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.600]   People, together, my extra extrovertedness, man.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.440]   It's missing people, so it is fun
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.160]   to get to be down here with you guys.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.800]   We are continuing a series called Therapy.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.040]   This your first week with us?
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.000]   You can check out the Porch app
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.480]   and you can find all the different messages
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.000]   that we've covered so far as we've gone through
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.960]   four different therapy sessions, if you will.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.520]   If ever our nation, or ever there was a time
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.460]   where people needed to go to therapy,
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.060]   we is there because we have all been experiencing
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.200]   a lot of turbulence in life.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.960]   And things were already bad before that.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.720]   Anxiety was at record highs.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.440]   Our generation, or the generation of young adults
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.680]   out right now, has higher levels of anxiety
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.420]   than any other group of people in the country.
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.280]   In fact, studies have shown that a psychiatric ward patient
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.280]   in the 1950s has the same amount,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.080]   or had the same amount of stress and anxiety
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.320]   as the average young adult today.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.240]   People are anxious, and we were anxious before COVID.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.760]   Mental health has been a huge issue,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.620]   and as we've talked about, if you've been with us,
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.100]   it's not always an issue that the church covers a lot of.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.240]   So we're not done with this series,
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.240]   and we're just continuing it tonight.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.480]   But we're gonna launch into, I think,
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   a tremendously crucial topic, especially for this season.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.660]   It's fun to be back in Houston.
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.840]   I'm from Houston originally.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.660]   I'm an Astros fan 'til I die,
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.020]   even though they did what they did.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.920]   And I'm a little bit sick, but it is not COVID.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.100]   I've had two tests.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.100]   It is not positive.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.180]   I'm the only person in America
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.300]   with a bacterial sinus infection right now, apparently.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.100]   But let me start with this
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.900]   to frame up where we're going for tonight.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.500]   When I was in college, I had a buddy of mine
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   who spent some time, one, he did what you do
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.540]   when you're in college, and you have a free day.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.100]   He just decided, I'm gonna go out to this lake
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.660]   that was nearby the campus that we went.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.700]   Anyone, any Aggies in the room in here?
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.540]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.260]   Yeah, so Lake Brian, he goes out.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260]   He's gonna go hang, read books, do it, you know,
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.140]   you do when you're in college.
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.500]   And he goes out, spends a day reading,
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.860]   chilling in a hammock, just kinda having the day out there.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.260]   And at some point, he realizes
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.780]   he needed to go to the bathroom.
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.380]   And there weren't any bathrooms around,
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.180]   and he didn't need to go,
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.020]   man, this is going somewhere too, by the way.
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.940]   He had to go, not number one, but number two of the bathroom.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.060]   So he does with guys, ladies, you should know this,
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.900]   will do in that situation, go to the woods,
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.540]   take care of business, use some leaves,
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.980]   everything's fine, it's all great.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.100]   He does so, goes back, reads his book,
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.060]   it's a great afternoon, jumps in the water,
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.460]   it's all good and fine.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.660]   Goes back home that night, falls asleep.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.780]   In the middle of the night, he wakes up,
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.260]   and he is covered in a poison ivy rash
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.300]   in a very unfortunate location.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.340]   It was like he was in a poison oak, not poison ivy,
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.620]   which is pretty much the same thing.
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.580]   Poison oak diaper rash was consuming his body.
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.820]   And this was basically a roommate of mine,
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.580]   and got to see all the experience
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.460]   that that was for the next month.
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.620]   But here's what began to happen.
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.580]   If you don't know this about poison ivy or poison oak,
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.940]   in order for a rash to heal, it has to be out in the light.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.860]   That's a very difficult place
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.940]   to consistently get exposed to the light.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.860]   And so for the next month, he did the same thing.
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.420]   He'd go to class, he'd sit in his chair,
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.300]   kind of squirm in tremendous pain,
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.740]   and then he'd go back home, and he would take an oatmeal bath.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.940]   I don't know why you take oatmeal baths,
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.980]   but apparently oatmeal's not just for breakfast anymore,
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.020]   it works through poison oak.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.980]   But this is what he would do,
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.740]   because he had to get it exposed to the light.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.220]   And the longer, or because it was difficult
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.220]   to bring out into the light,
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.820]   it delayed healing of it taking place.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.420]   So it was there for weeks, I repeat, weeks.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.740]   And I learned, just through that incidence,
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.740]   a important principle as it relates to poison oak
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.700]   that translates into the scripture
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.940]   we're gonna look at tonight, teaches
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.700]   that the longer something is kept in the dark,
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.580]   it delays it from healing.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.540]   And the same is true in you and I's life.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.500]   The longer that we keep things in hiding,
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.620]   we keep things in the dark,
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.020]   we don't bring other people in
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.780]   and open up about where we are struggling,
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.700]   we delay experiencing healing in our lives.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.340]   As I said, this is a really important topic,
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.020]   because as a pastor, and it probably goes without saying,
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.700]   all of us have seen it, there has been spikes
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.500]   in all types of, alcohol is through the roof sales,
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.900]   prescription drug addiction is through the roof,
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.580]   sexual sin and pornography is through the roof.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.700]   And we all came in here and everybody looks pretty
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.060]   and they look like, you know,
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.700]   somebody that would be fun to go,
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.780]   we're hanging out together,
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.780]   but all of us came in with stuff in our life
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.860]   that if we are not intentional to bring into the light,
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.020]   we will not experience healing.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.820]   And it's a problem that's not going away,
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.980]   it's only gonna get worse
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.380]   and it brings with it certain things.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.020]   So tonight, we're gonna look at four ideas
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.220]   as it relates to healing.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.020]   As I've said, this series is about therapy.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.100]   My wife is a counselor and one of the things
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.780]   that if you go see any different counselor,
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.660]   they will suggest is you have to bring things forward,
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.940]   you have to be in relationship with other people
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.580]   where you can share what's actually going on,
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.220]   if not, it's a recipe for anxiety,
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.540]   it's a recipe for depression
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.660]   and it is a recipe that ends in addiction.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.620]   And so now we're gonna look at one of the principles
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.980]   behind why that is and cover four different ideas.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.780]   I'm gonna write or I'm just gonna give you the first one
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.540]   and I'll show you the scripture it comes from.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.940]   But you may not know this, but shame brings anxiety.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.260]   If you're carrying shame from an eating disorder in here,
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.140]   if you're carrying shame from a same sex attraction
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.620]   you've never told anybody about,
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.060]   an abortion that's a part of your past
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.340]   you've never told anybody about,
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.740]   or at least nobody recently.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.660]   From sexual sin in your own life or from anything,
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.300]   it will bring with it anxiety every time.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.140]   Here's how we know this,
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.860]   this comes straight out of Genesis chapter two
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.260]   and chapter three where basically,
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.460]   if you're not familiar with Genesis,
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.500]   it's a story of kind of where did everything originate from?
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.380]   God creates the world, everything's perfect.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.700]   Adam and Eve are the only two people on the planet,
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.200]   they're the crown of God's creation.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.580]   God performs a wedding ceremony
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.180]   with just Adam and just Eve.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.460]   And Adam looks at her and sings the very first version
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.580]   of "Your Body's a Wonderland."
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.140]   He's like, "This naked girl's for me
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.380]   "and they're naked and without shame," the Bible says.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.220]   It says this,
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.980]   "Because of this, a man will leave his father and mother
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.060]   "and hold fast to his wife
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.660]   "and they shall become one flesh.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.700]   "And the man and his wife were both naked and not ashamed."
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.780]   Just two love birds running around in the garden of delight,
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.480]   which is what the word Eden means.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.780]   And they experienced no shame.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.700]   And then God says, "There's one command during this time,"
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.940]   you're probably familiar with it,
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.860]   "What was the one command?
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.180]   "You can't eat from this one tree.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.800]   "Everything else, fair game,
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.820]   "just don't eat from the tree of the knowledge
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.660]   "of good and evil."
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.780]   That was the entire rule book,
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.860]   that was the entire Bible.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.660]   The entire Bible could have fit on a fortune cookie.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.300]   That was it, just don't eat from that one tree.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.020]   Adam and Eve, like five minutes go by
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.700]   and they eat from the tree, of course,
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.560]   and all of a sudden sin enters the world
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.940]   and with it came shame and with it came anxiety.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.540]   We're told that after eating it,
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.580]   their eyes were opened
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.580]   and Adam and Eve ran into essentially the forest
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.940]   and they ran from God.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.380]   Previously, when they heard God coming,
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.740]   they ran towards him, now they run from him.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.740]   Because they were afraid, because shame brings anxiety.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:14.620]   The more that you and I hold on and hide things,
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.700]   you're gonna bring more and more anxiety in your life.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.820]   Am I saying if you have anxiety,
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.660]   it's 'cause you're hiding something?
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.340]   No, I'm saying if you're hiding something,
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.980]   you're gonna bring anxiety into your life.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.100]   It says this, Adam said, "When I heard you coming,"
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.240]   this is Genesis chapter three, verse 10,
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.900]   "the sound of you, God, in the garden,
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.820]   "I was afraid."
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.500]   Man's first interaction with fear, with anxiety,
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.680]   is introduced, "Because I was naked and I hid myself.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.260]   "I was ashamed."
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.460]   Rather than bring their sin to God
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.340]   and what they had done to God, they ran from him
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.500]   and they began to attempt to hide
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.500]   what they were ashamed of in their life.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.060]   All of us have gotten used to, I think,
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.180]   if Houston and most places around the country
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.820]   that are listening, or anything like Dallas,
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.980]   we've all gotten used to these.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.020]   Anybody know what this is?
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.380]   This is an N95 mask that I'm pretty sure is a fake,
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.260]   but it nonetheless works to go into the store.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.100]   And do you guys have like mask mandates?
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.980]   - Yeah. - Well, you have to,
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.940]   pretty much everywhere you go now.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.260]   Such a weird time.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.660]   Anyways, we've all gotten used to wearing these.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.900]   The truth is, most of us have been wearing masks
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.000]   our whole life.
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.420]   You never told anybody about what happened to you.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.940]   You experienced some sort of abuse.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.020]   It wasn't your fault and you never told anybody.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.180]   And you've been hiding.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:42.020]   And the tragedy is, as long as you hide,
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.440]   God will not heal.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.900]   And you're gonna carry shame that you don't have to.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.540]   They cover it up with fig leaves.
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:55.020]   We hide today, we hide behind our words.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.660]   We hide behind not telling people the truth.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:03.360]   And anytime we do, the reality is,
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.940]   God cannot heal what we won't reveal.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.780]   It's the second idea.
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.880]   So shame brings anxiety,
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.540]   but God won't heal what we will not reveal.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.580]   Proverbs 28, verse 13 says this.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.580]   Whoever conceals or hides their sin does not prosper,
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.860]   but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:30.700]   Solomon says, whoever hides or conceals their sin,
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.780]   what's going on, will not prosper.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.700]   That sin's not going anywhere.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.060]   If anything, it's only gonna get worse.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.900]   But whoever confesses, who brings it out into the open,
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.740]   telling someone not just God,
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.780]   but other people in their life will experience healing.
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.460]   In other words, Solomon would say,
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.020]   anything that you and I refuse to bring others into,
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.020]   and I know it's all over this room, man,
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.780]   and God's not angry at you, and you're embarrassed,
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.020]   and you think I'm talking to you, and I am talking to you,
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.180]   and you're carrying shame for it, and you don't have to.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.620]   And God who loves you says, anything you won't reveal,
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.620]   I cannot heal, I will not heal.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.320]   But he invites you, it's possible.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.600]   You can come out of hiding.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.100]   You can experience freedom.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.060]   And someday, you're thinking to yourself,
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.540]   I'm not gonna do this forever.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.100]   When I get married, I'm gonna stop looking at pornography.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.740]   When I get married, I'm gonna stop drinking so much.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.780]   When I get married, I'm gonna stop doing this.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.300]   Let me tell you the truth.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.780]   That's not changing when you get married.
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.620]   That's changing when you stop hiding.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.620]   Marriage doesn't make sin go away.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.580]   If anything, it magnifies it.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.340]   And anything that you say, nope, not bringing this out,
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.440]   is something where in effect, you say to God,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.400]   I'm not allowing access to this in my life,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.340]   because God will not heal what we are unwilling to reveal.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.800]   So the flip side, the third idea,
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.480]   is that confession is the cure.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.360]   Confession, and by confession, I mean,
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.160]   telling someone other than God.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.280]   All of us, I know everybody in here,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.040]   you know, you did it again, you slept together,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.560]   you crossed the boundary with your boyfriend
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.920]   or your girlfriend that you promised
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.080]   you wouldn't do it again, and you go home,
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.400]   you lay on your pillow, and you say,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.720]   God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, please forgive me.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.720]   That type of confession, let me just be abundantly clear,
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.980]   biblically, is worthless.
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.640]   If you're a follower of Jesus, and you've confessed sin,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.980]   you've trusted what Jesus has done,
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.440]   it says that you and I are to bring our confession
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.080]   to other people inside of our life,
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.880]   and by worthless, I don't mean it doesn't matter,
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.020]   or it's not practical, or anything,
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.680]   I mean, functionally, it does not change your behavior,
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.940]   because James says the way that you and I
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.060]   experience healing from behavior in our life
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.520]   is by confessing to another person.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.160]   He says this, James, in James chapter five, verse 16,
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.240]   he says, "Confession is the cure.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.660]   "Therefore, confess your sins to each other,
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.480]   "and pray for each other, so that you may be healed."
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.560]   Here's what I love about James writing this verse.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.720]   Like, James just wrote, hey, here's,
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.080]   you wanna experience healing in your life,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.760]   you wanna change, you wanna stop,
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.160]   here's the formula, he says,
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.020]   "Confess to another believer in your life,
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.200]   "have them pray for you, bring it out into the open,
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.760]   "and express that to another person,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.400]   "and you'll experience supernatural healing."
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.600]   Think about who's writing this.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.800]   You guys know who James is?
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.280]   James is the baby brother of Jesus.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.120]   You guys know that?
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.400]   Like, Jesus had, like, little baby brothers.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.440]   He had siblings, sisters, he had siblings in his life.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.660]   How rough would that be?
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.560]   You think your older sister, firstborn, is perfect?
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.960]   How'd you like to follow Jesus,
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.200]   where every night you're sitting at the table with mom,
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.040]   and it's like, why can't you be
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.960]   a little bit more like Jesus?
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.080]   Well, mom, he's God.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.000]   That can't be easy.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.260]   But James didn't just see, like, his brother's perfect,
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.160]   you know, dinner table etiquette.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.720]   He saw his brother give sight to the blind.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.080]   He saw his brother do incredible, miraculous things,
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.720]   laying people, they couldn't walk their entire life,
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.040]   Jesus goes up, his big brother touches them, they can walk.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.760]   He saw him give hearing back to people
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.280]   who had never been able to hear before,
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.100]   open the eyes of people to be able to see,
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.960]   allow people to speak, or give the tongue back to the mute.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.680]   James saw all of this take place.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.880]   He saw his brother supernaturally heal people.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.680]   And then he writes this book we call James,
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.640]   and in it he says, if you wanna experience
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.800]   supernatural healing in your life, here's how.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.860]   You gotta bring other people in.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.880]   It's not going away.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.680]   Maybe it's a hurt from a parent,
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.840]   there's something that happened to you,
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.340]   and it wasn't your fault, but it's not going away
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.200]   unless you bring someone in,
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.100]   unless you bring it out in the open.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.100]   And share.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.100]   And share.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.700]   Which James says, confess,
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:48.700]   and you'll experience the supernatural healing in your life,
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.940]   'cause confession is the cure,
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.240]   it's a part of the equation every single time.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.580]   I think one of the hardest lies
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.060]   that you're gonna have to get over right now
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.180]   is that if you bring it to your life Bible study group,
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.540]   or you bring it to your community group,
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.940]   to the soliciting, your small group, wherever you're at,
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.780]   the lie that you're thinking right now,
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.420]   "I can't share that, that's so embarrassing.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   "What are they gonna think about me?
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.000]   "They're gonna think I'm like some messed up pervert
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.900]   "who I can't believe you even do that,
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.180]   "or you're so messed up."
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.420]   Let me tell you abundantly clear,
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.500]   here's what they're gonna think about you, ready?
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.480]   You're gonna bring that to them?
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.980]   Their trust to believe in your life?
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.580]   Here's what they're gonna, everyone?
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.740]   They're gonna think you're a lot like them,
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.340]   only more honest.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.480]   That's what they're gonna think.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.660]   If they're a believer and a follower of Jesus,
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.660]   as Christians, all of us,
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.960]   in order to get into the club, if you will,
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.900]   you have to acknowledge, I'm not a perfect person,
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.720]   I need a savior.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.340]   That's part of the starting line of being a Christian,
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.940]   is saying, "Don't have it all together?
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.280]   "I don't have it all together?
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.100]   "That's why I need Jesus, that's why I need a savior."
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.500]   And there's something messed up in the church
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.000]   where it's like, after you become a Christian,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.420]   you can't be a Christian anymore,
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.980]   or you have to pretend like you have it all together,
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.500]   when the criteria for getting in is being someone
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   who says, "I don't have it all together."
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.220]   Do you have people in your life
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.900]   where you can bring openly and honestly,
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.900]   you have a small group,
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.300]   do people know what's going on?
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.660]   You don't have to share it with everybody,
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.760]   you're right here on the stage every time.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.340]   But are there people in your life that know
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.780]   how you're doing?
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.940]   They know about your dating relationship,
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.040]   they know about where if Satan was gonna take you out,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.340]   or you're tempted to drift back towards old ways
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.420]   or old habits, do they know those things?
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.380]   Because you will not experience healing
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.280]   unless it involves you revealing it
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.380]   to other people inside of your life.
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.020]   This changed my life in my early 20s.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:47.280]   When I was 12 years old, I was on a bus to a church camp.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.720]   We stopped at this hotel, and we got off,
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.880]   everybody goes in the room, and when you're like 12,
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.720]   you're like, "Dude, look at this,
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.680]   "they got free soap in here, I'm taking it with me."
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.820]   And it's just the whole amazing, you know,
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.560]   kid hotel moment.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.200]   And I was in a room with a guy who threw on the TV,
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.440]   and he immediately went straight to pornography.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.140]   I'd never seen pornography before.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.280]   It was like, I don't even know what to think about this.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.840]   And as a guy, all the different wheels begin to turn,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.000]   and I don't know how many minutes it lasted,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.720]   but if I close my eyes or I think about it,
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.960]   I can see those images still.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.080]   It takes a moment to see and a lifetime to get rid of.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.800]   And that put me on a journey where for the next 10 years,
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.600]   I've struggled with pornography in my life as a Christian.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.000]   And it wasn't something I was proud of,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.960]   it wasn't something I wanted,
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.160]   it was something, honestly, I hated,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.480]   but I was so afraid of what would happen
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.880]   if I actually told somebody that.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.960]   And then when I was in college,
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.480]   it was my junior year of college,
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.680]   this guy who lived across the street,
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.840]   he busts in the door like he's Kramer on Seinfeld
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.640]   or something, and he says, "I don't wanna do it anymore.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.200]   "I don't wanna do this anymore.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   "This is hurting my faith."
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.640]   And he began to talk about his pornography,
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.600]   and he just said, "I need you to hold me accountable.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.720]   "I need you to know everything that I'm looking at."
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.160]   And it was the first time I'd ever seen anyone
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.360]   be that honest.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.080]   And he said, "Hey, will you pray for me?
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.320]   "Will you hold me accountable?
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.560]   "I want you to help me."
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.920]   So of course I prayed for him,
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.120]   and in those moments, it was the first time
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.440]   I'd seen anybody be like that.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.760]   And I prayed and I just said,
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.280]   "Before you go, you're gonna know that
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.600]   "that's a part of my life.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.280]   "I don't want it to be that way."
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   And that was a pivotal moment
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.480]   where for the rest of, like for years after that,
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.520]   we began to put a software on both of our phones,
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.600]   several other friends of ours
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.840]   that had all struggled with that
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.440]   and began to see everything that I was looking at
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.880]   on the internet, and I could see everything that he was.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.360]   And through every time that I was tempted
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.840]   or every time that I looked at pornography again
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.840]   or masturbated again or did any of that again,
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.640]   I brought that to believers in my life.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.600]   Said, "Pray for me.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.280]   "I want you to know this."
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.760]   Even at a thought level before I ever even got there,
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.320]   I just said, "Here's what you need to know.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.640]   "I saw this billboard driving down the road today
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.760]   "and I've been thinking about it since.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.120]   "And I may wanna do something
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.200]   "that I don't want to do in my heart of hearts,
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.760]   "but I kinda wanna do it right now.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.840]   "Will you please pray for me,
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.120]   "hold me accountable and know that."
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.440]   And it changed my life.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.560]   I know inside of this room,
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.640]   it's not just pornography,
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.480]   it's prescription medication addiction.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.040]   It's alcohol.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.560]   It's cutting.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.920]   It's a lot of stuff.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:31.400]   Maybe it's a debt problem, it's out of control.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.080]   And God is not angry at you.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.120]   It's not why he's saying confess,
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.640]   he loves you so much he gave his life for you.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.400]   And he doesn't want you to be owned and imprisoned.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.480]   Maybe it's anxiety.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.040]   And you're just not opening up with other people.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.360]   You're afraid, like, what are they gonna think?
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.440]   Maybe it's depression.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.800]   It's not always even a sin
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.560]   that we're hiding.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.440]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.000]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.840]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.640]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.480]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.120]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.880]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.560]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.160]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.560]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.120]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.560]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.000]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.360]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.680]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.840]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.360]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.880]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.440]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.080]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.560]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.040]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.520]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.920]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.320]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.680]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.040]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.440]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.880]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.280]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.760]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.160]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:48.160]   It's not always a sin that we're hiding.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.440]   They're angry, they're in conflict,
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.560]   they're experiencing division with one another.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.320]   Addiction rates are through the roof.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.240]   Suicide is through the roof.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.120]   Depression is through the roof.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.640]   And the church offers the only solutions to those problems.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.240]   Which first starts with a relationship with Jesus
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.600]   and it starts with walking with God's people.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.240]   Once you're connected to God's son.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.520]   And day by day living authentically
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.080]   and confessing sin with other people.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.520]   So my hunch is, dude,
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.280]   the brightest days of the church are ahead.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.360]   Because we offer a solution to so many of the problems
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.460]   that are gonna plague in our plaguing society
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.840]   as much as they ever have before.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.360]   But if God's gonna use you as a part of his body
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.080]   and in this way and in the mission that he has all of us,
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.840]   if you're a follower of Jesus on,
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.360]   you have gotta get healthy.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.200]   Which means you gotta open up.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.640]   And I'm not talking about if he's gonna use you
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.480]   to go into ministry.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.880]   I'm saying if you're a Christian,
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.040]   you're on the planet, you are breathing
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.880]   because God has a purpose for you
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.000]   to know God and to make him known.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.080]   But the degree to which he is going to use you
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.240]   will be limited to the degree to which you are willing
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.860]   to get things out in the open.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:02.960]   We have this handheld vacuum that we keep in my kitchen.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   And it's one of those things that,
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.920]   it's like a black and decker.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.440]   It's not the most impressive thing of all time.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.500]   Gets the job done.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.960]   Go around and when you have little kids,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.160]   your floors are constantly dirty.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.280]   So there's dirt and there's Cheerios and there's goldfish
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.400]   and just kind of stuff everywhere.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.040]   So because of that, all my ladies in the house know
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.160]   that any mama out there, like she has like certain things.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.720]   This is one thing I've realized about women,
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.640]   men is like they're okay with like clutter everywhere.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.960]   And then there will be this one type of clutter
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.060]   not okay with.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.040]   So this could be like, for her, it's like, man,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.800]   hey, it could be disgusting room.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.040]   Gotta have clean sheets.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.280]   Gotta have clean sheets.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.520]   If you're not clean, do not come into this bed.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.840]   The other thing with her is floors.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.960]   She's like, man, it can be just kind of chaos everywhere.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.760]   I should have really shared this with her
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.600]   before I shared this story,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.660]   but it can be chaos everywhere.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.440]   And then, hey, just want clean floors.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.360]   So we keep this vacuum nearby,
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.920]   get anything that's cut up.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.200]   Every now and then, because it's a really small vacuum,
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.880]   there's like a small spout at the front of it.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.240]   Don't we get something that will get lodged inside of there.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.240]   What happens whenever like half of the vacuum is clogged up?
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.200]   It's operating at half capacity.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.440]   It's not able to function or operate as well as it could
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.400]   'cause half of it is blocked.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.040]   You know what's further interesting?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.080]   It's like whenever like a goldfish gets stuck in there,
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.120]   it doesn't just block half of it.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.840]   It also increases the likelihood
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.540]   that other things are going to get caught and blocked.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:35.400]   Further decreasing its effectiveness.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.120]   It's gonna have to do with you.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.280]   Anytime you and I get something lodged in our spirit,
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.000]   in our soul, in our life, whether it's a sin,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.160]   or maybe it's hurt,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.560]   maybe it's something that happened to you,
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.280]   if you don't deal with it and get it out,
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.040]   you're not operating at 100% and you won't be.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.280]   And just like in that vacuum illustration where,
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.160]   hey, man, as long as it's there,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.880]   it's gonna block other things that are there.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.460]   As long as you never deal with that hurt from your dad,
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.920]   you're gonna be more sensitive
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.560]   and more quickly prone to get hurt from other people.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.520]   You're gonna pick up things that maybe in neutral,
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.160]   you wouldn't pick up, but you're gonna pick them up.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.480]   As long as you're addicted to pornography,
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.760]   you're gonna walk around and every girl that you see
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.200]   or every guy that you see,
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.200]   you're gonna begin to think through
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.800]   what they would look like naked
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.520]   because there's something blocking there.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.840]   And the more that, the longer that it's there,
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.780]   that problem's not going away.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.040]   If anything, it is getting worse
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.720]   and you're not gonna operate
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.820]   and experience all that God wants for you.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.360]   I don't know what that looks like for you tonight.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.280]   To confess to another believer in your life.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.060]   But I know that those who are in the room
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.120]   that are listening, that are thinking,
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.820]   and I'm talking to you, you know,
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.160]   there's somebody in your life
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.960]   you need to bring that forward to.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.920]   Maybe it's a volunteer here,
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.400]   maybe it's a life Bible study here,
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.240]   maybe it's a community group for wherever you're listening.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.720]   This is why we hammer being connected
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.280]   and being known and having relationships with other people
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.040]   'cause what you hide will not heal.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.680]   When I was 22, I'll close here,
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:08.600]   I went to the dentist for the very first time.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.000]   And it was an interesting experience.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.520]   I'd never been before.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.760]   I tell the story and people are like,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.320]   how did your mom, what is your mom, parents not love you?
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.520]   I think I had straight teeth.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.000]   And she was like, hey, get back in the game, you'll be fine.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.720]   So when I was 22, I got dental insurance.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.120]   I was like, oh man, this is exciting.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.940]   I got dental insurance.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.960]   I'm gonna go to the dentist, this is gonna be amazing.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.720]   And I go, and your first time at the dentist,
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.080]   it was like I relived the seven-year-old experience
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.780]   you probably had where you're like, oh dude,
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.160]   the chairs, man, they got suckers afterwards.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.080]   And I'm experiencing all of that at 22.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.280]   And the dentist comes in, they do the X-rays, they take it.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.640]   And he comes back and he says, I got good news,
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.000]   I got bad news.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.600]   I said, all right, let's start with the good news.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.400]   And he says, good news is your teeth
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.300]   are relatively straight.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.960]   Okay, bad news is you have 14 cavities.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.160]   Yeah, I know, I was like,
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.040]   what do I not have 14 teeth?
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.840]   What do you mean 14 cavities?
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.280]   He's like, first off, you have 32 teeth.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.360]   Second off, there's three surfaces on every tooth,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.740]   and so you can actually get three cavities
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.700]   on a single tooth, which I had done, thankfully.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.280]   Or not thankfully. (laughs)
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   Thankfully. (laughs)
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.240]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.960]   He begins to go through a diagnostic list of questions
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.040]   of like, what are you doing?
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.560]   Are you drinking a lot of soda?
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.400]   What's your diet like?
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.280]   How often are you brushing your teeth?
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.580]   Are you sleeping with candy in your mouth?
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.440]   To find out what is causing this problem
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.240]   inside of my mouth.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.960]   And of course, I wasn't doing that.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.680]   I just didn't like to floss, but point being,
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.120]   that day, I did something that over and over,
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.880]   I feel like I've seen God have me do in life,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.440]   and I've seen the power of when we do something similar
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.640]   as it relates to our spiritual life
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.360]   and our spiritual health.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.520]   That day, I opened up my mouth,
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.720]   and I allowed somebody to look in
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.000]   and see things that I may not have seen.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.420]   And when they identified or they saw something
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.500]   that may be harmful, that may be hurting,
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.440]   that may be leading to further brokenness down the road,
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.660]   they begin to say, "Hey, you need to make some changes
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.360]   "as it relates to your dental health."
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.560]   And the same way, that's the exact idea
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.820]   that the Bible says you and I are to do inside of our life,
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.300]   where we open up our lives,
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.780]   not our mouth to other people, but our lives,
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.060]   and we allow people to speak into
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.140]   the things that we're doing,
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:37.500]   to know where we're hurting ourselves, maybe,
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.340]   to know where we're struggling, where we're tempted,
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.620]   or we're just believing a lie.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:47.540]   And if you do, you'll begin to experience
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.500]   healing inside of your life.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.260]   And God has invited you, "Man, I don't want you
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.480]   "to live the rest of your days owning,
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.380]   "or having this own you.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.740]   "How long are you gonna carry this?"
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.900]   And you keep pushing off, saying,
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.580]   "No, I'll deal with it later, I'll deal with it later."
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.540]   The day you'll deal with it is the day you decide,
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.380]   "I'm gonna bring it into the light."
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.780]   Why would you waste, why would any of us waste
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.600]   another moment believing the lie of one last time?
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.540]   It never works, it never happens.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.780]   The one last time happens when you and I choose.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.100]   I don't care what anyone thinks,
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.640]   I'm bringing it out into the open.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.700]   And you'll begin to experience healing.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.880]   If you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.320]   there's nothing that can separate you from God's love.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.380]   You'll spend eternity with Him forever,
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.580]   but He's invited you to experience
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.720]   greater and greater freedom on this earth.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:44.900]   But that'll involve you and I opening up our lives
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.100]   to other people and letting them speak into,
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.020]   doing what Ephesians, I'm sorry,
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.020]   Hebrews chapter three, I'm closing here,
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:57.060]   says, "Take care, brothers, lest any of you
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.480]   have an evil, unbelieving heart,
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.820]   leading you to fall away from the living God.
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:08.480]   But exhort or call out one another daily,
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.920]   as long as it is called today,
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.920]   so that none of you would be hardened
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.300]   by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.560]   He says, "You want to experience the remedy
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.960]   for spiritual heart disease.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.760]   It involves having other people in your life
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.280]   that can call you out where you need to be called out,
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.760]   that can call you," the word exhort,
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.040]   such a churchy word, just means,
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.400]   "I'm gonna call you to be everything
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   that God wants you to be,
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.000]   everything that you and your heart of heart want to be.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.440]   And I need you to lock arms with me,
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.400]   and I'm not letting go of you,
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.320]   and you're not letting go of me,
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.440]   and we're gonna walk through life like this together."
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.440]   If you don't have that,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.000]   you're not gonna experience the abundant life
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.840]   God wants for you.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.280]   And it's not coming from some church program
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.240]   where you sign up for this class
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.080]   and you'll experience that.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.080]   It comes from having real relationships
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.760]   with people who, like you, are trying to follow Jesus,
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.160]   and we need one another.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.320]   And you're not gonna experience healing,
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.520]   you're not gonna be the husband you wanna be,
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.800]   you're not gonna be the wife that you wanna be,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.120]   you're not ready to get married if you don't have that.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.840]   'Cause you got some stuff you gotta deal with.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.400]   God already paid for it and dealt with it,
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.720]   consequence ultimately on the cross for that.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.240]   But tonight and today and every day
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.280]   is a day where as believers,
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.560]   we go to war through opening up our mouth
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.320]   and saying, "This is where I'm struggling.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.800]   I need you to know this."
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.440]   And when you do, when you do, when we do,
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.880]   healing happens.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.000]   Or you can just keep hiding.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Let me pray.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.960]   Father, I pray for every person in this room
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:47.160]   who has walked through a difficult last six months.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:52.360]   Maybe they've lost their job
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.720]   or they've lost somebody that they love,
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.840]   or they've just experienced anger and hurt
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.480]   and bitterness and confusion
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.760]   and all the emotions that all of us have felt.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.240]   That in the midst of all of that pain,
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.400]   they turned to something to distract them
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.120]   or to help them cope with.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:20.680]   And it was something that is owning and continuing to own.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.280]   Maybe it was an eating disorder.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.200]   Maybe it was an old relationship
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.120]   that had no business being in.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.160]   Maybe it was a bottle of alcohol
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.560]   or a bowl of weed or whatever it was.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.760]   And they keep feeding that and feeding that.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.120]   And they're not opening up to anybody
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.480]   that you right now would pierce through their heart,
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:43.200]   give them the courage to follow you
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.600]   and to open up honestly
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.280]   and walk in the light with other people.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.080]   And when they do, you meet them there
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.000]   in healing room, rush in.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.960]   Just like you rush towards Adam and Eve
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.720]   to cover their sin,
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.240]   to call them out of hiding,
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.960]   that that would happen for friends all over this room.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.800]   Thinking that Jesus paid for all of it on the cross.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.560]   And we're not defined by anything other
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.400]   than our faith in Him and what He did on that cross.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.840]   And we worship you now in song.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.200]   I thank you for Port Houston,
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.000]   where the brightest and best days in your church be ahead
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.240]   because of the men and women in this room
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.000]   who radically go all in with you
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.200]   and they follow you with recklessness
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.240]   because they respond to the incredible love
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.120]   that you have recklessly poured out for all of us.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.400]   We worship you now in song, amen.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.740]   (whooshing)
