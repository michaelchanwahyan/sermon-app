00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Hey again. Porch, it's good to see you. How are we doing tonight? Yeah? Awesome. So good to have you here.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 So grateful you would trust us with your evening. Not only those of you here in the room, which it's great to see you.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Also all of you that are tuning in online, it's great to have you with us.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Special shout out to our Porch Live locations. Can we give them a round of applause please? Yes.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 We love that God's doing work here, but he's doing work out there too.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Special shout out to Des Moines, Dayton, and Fresno. We love that you guys are a part of the evening.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Porch, I am so excited. Let me tell you why. Because tonight you get to hear from, and I'm not just saying this,

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 this is an empty lip service, one of my favorite communicators of the Bible.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And before I introduce him to you, what I wanted to tell you tonight is something that we're committed to here at the Porch

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 is introducing to you new voices. Voices that maybe you haven't heard before, but you need to hear.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And you will be glad you have heard from. People that don't just stand on a platform of trend, but stand on a platform of truth.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And that's the guy that's coming tonight. The individual that's going to be teaching you tonight, he is a good friend of mine.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 We knew each other in Houston, Texas. And he is genuinely someone that I look at the example of and say,

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 "Man, I want to love Jesus like that. I want to walk with Jesus and believe in Jesus and have the kind of intensity and fervor that that guy has."

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And you're going to see exactly what I mean in just a minute.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Porch, will you all do a great job of helping me welcome my friend, Tyler Moffitt.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 [Applause]

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Love you. Thank you, God.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Porch, how we doing tonight? Come on.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Man, it's surreal for me to be up here because I did the math.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 It was 10 years ago almost to the day that, so I grew up in Houston, but I spent a number of years in Dallas.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And I was living with a host family up in Allen, Texas.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Anybody from Allen? Come on. Go Eagles, right?

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And anyway, I come down 75 all alone about 10 years ago.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And I'm like, I'm going to go to the porch by myself.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And I show up and I sit right up there.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So I understand what you guys are feeling.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And I walk in. I had no idea what to expect.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And I was just blown away by what you just experienced worshipping of thousands of young adults across Dallas that are just giving praise and honor to Jesus.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And we're like, man, there's so many of us. This is amazing.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And then Shane and Shane was leading worship.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I'm like, Shane and Shane. I just, I was, you know, a fan.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 So they finish and they pray. Everyone bows their head.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 The lights get dark and I'm like, my roommates got to know I saw Shane and Shane.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 So I take out my camera from my iPhone 5 and I'm like, I got to get a picture.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 So I take a picture and it goes flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And everyone mid-prayer turns around like, what the heck, moron.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And I'm standing there alone like, oh, Lord, I just, the rapture could come right now.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 That'd be awesome.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And, but you know what?

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I came back and came back and just got poured into through this place.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And I love Kylan. Kylan and I got to know each other in Houston.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And man, he is the real deal.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 He's on his knees just praying, begging for revival in this city and in your heart.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And so to be here is just amazing.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Hey, real quick about me, and then we're going to jump, we're going to dive into the text.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I think we have a picture of my family.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 This is my wife, Jen, and our three little kiddos, ages four, three, and one, just turned one.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And they wanted to come, but my wife was like, I need them in bed.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 You know, I'm like, I get it.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And so they're not here, but we live down in Houston.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 But my wife and I actually met here in Dallas.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 In fact, I was working at a different church, but my wife was going to Watermark.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 True story.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Some of you are going, that's all I need.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I can find marriage at this place.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Let's go, right?

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And, but seriously, she was here and I would slip over Saturday nights or Tuesday night to the porch or to Watermark to come and hear from the word.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And as I look back in Dallas, my time in Dallas, there's some really sweet years.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 But also, and I even felt it as I was driving up 45 today, my time in Dallas was some of my most insecure years of my life.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I mean, I failed at my job in relationships with my family more during my time in Dallas than any other season.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And, and some of that began to wash back over me, even as I was driving in.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And I thought, maybe some of you here tonight, some of you are killing it.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 You're just, you drove in on your Tesla, just loving life, right?

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 But others of you, man, you're in that insecure place.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And I just go, I get it.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 I feel that.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And I think God wants to speak to us tonight, wherever you are on that spectrum, but he wants to speak to you.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And so we're going to dig into his word.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So if you have your Bible or they're on your phone, go to the book of Isaiah.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And we're going to be in Isaiah chapter 49.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Isaiah 49, the book of Isaiah is kind of wild because a lot of coffee cup verses, right?

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 A lot of cute, your grandma's got it in her house, but you read the book of Isaiah and it's judgment, wrath, fire, exile.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And you go, this is not that nice.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 And yet in chapter 49, there's a bit of a shift.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And that's what we're going to see today.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Hey, wherever you're at in this place, I believe God wants to speak to you tonight.

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And so let's pray and ask him to come and commune with us in a mighty way.

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And then let's dig in.

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Let's pray.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Father, we believe that you reign above it all.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Everything we just sang is not just some cute word.

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 It is true.

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And so come Holy Spirit, invade this place.

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 May there not be one inch of our lives that you leave untouched after an encounter with the living God.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Oh, we expect big things, big things tonight.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 So come speak through your word.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Your servants are listening in Jesus name.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Amen.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 All right.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 I remember when my wife and I first got married, we decided we were going to do Whole30.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Any of you know what Whole30 is?

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Okay.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Wow, some Whole30 enthusiasts.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Whole30 is where for 30 days you don't eat any gluten, any sugar, or any dairy.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Some of you are like, you just described my diet, right?

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And that was me.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 For 30 days, no gluten, sugar, dairy.

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And my wife and I were excited.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 We had been eating a lot, you know, in our wedding and after.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And we're like, let's just go for it.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 So we did it.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And we made it three-fourths of one day through Whole30.

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Breakfast, we killed it.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Lunch, killed it.

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Dinner, we get invited to BJ's for a friend's birthday party.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And we had the talk on the way there.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 We're like, salad, no croutons, no cheese, oil and vinegar on the side.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 We got this, you know.

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And so we sit down at our table.

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And sure enough, the waitress starts with us.

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 What do you guys want?

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Salad, oil and vinegar on the side, no croutons, no cheese, fist pump, right?

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 You know, and she's like, okay.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And then before she goes to the next person, she goes, oh, by the way, pizza's half off tonight.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 We're like, ooh.

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And then we hear every one of our friends, pizza, pizza, pizza, meat lovers, pepperoni, pizza.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 And then we get to the end.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 She's like, anything else?

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And right before she leaves, we're like, yeah, change ours to pizza.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 We want pizza.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Because here's the thing.

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 The ideal of Whole30, the idea of getting in shape and eating healthy sounded so good until we were confronted with sugar and dairy and gluten in a BJ's pizza.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Now, here's why I say that.

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 So often, everything we sing about, the gospel we declare is an ideal that many of us, if it was on a test, we would go, that's what I want.

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 That's what I want in my life.

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I intellectually believe it.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I've done the whole thing.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I've gotten baptized.

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 But deep down, when you start living the reality of life, it's a little more messy; right?

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And so sometimes we would go, yes, I believe it's true.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 You reign.

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And yet deep down we're just staring at these ceiling tiles going, God, I want to believe it's true.

135
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 But reality of my life right now feels a lot different.

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 See, Isaiah, the reason why we're in Isaiah is because in the book of Isaiah, it's written by a prophet named Isaiah, written to people in exile, Babylonian exile, going back over Israel's history.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And what he's telling them is, look, there's a reason why you're in the place that you're in.

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And so much of the book is judgment, judgment, judgment, but then it changes and it shifts to a moment of salvation.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Look at Isaiah 49 and look at verse 13.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Isaiah 49 is all, here's God saying, this is the salvation I'm bringing.

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 It's soon.

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 It's eventual.

143
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 It's ultimate.

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And then verse 13 is the climax.

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 God says, "Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Break forth, O mountains, into singing."

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Why?

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 "For the Lord has comforted His people, and He will have compassion on His afflicted."

149
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 He says, despite all that you're experiencing right now and all the judgment and all the things that came because of your sin, salvation's coming, so you better start singing.

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Comfort is coming.

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Compassion is coming.

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And we're going to watch in the next three verses how Israel, how the people of God respond to this amazing word of salvation.

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And the first thing we see from the people is an honest feeling, an honest complaint to this salvation that's coming.

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Look at Isaiah 49, verse 14.

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 It says, "But Zion said, but the people of God said, 'The Lord has forsaken me.

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 My Lord has forgotten me.'"

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Okay, so pause there.

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 They just heard salvation is coming and sing for joy, comfort, and compassion, and their response, they interrupt God and they say, "That's great, but you know what we feel?

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 We feel forsaken by you.

160
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 We feel forgotten by you.

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 That's what we feel."

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 It doesn't say they don't believe in God or believe in His promises.

163
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 What it says is despite what they intellectually believe, they feel forsaken.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 They would maybe even say, "God, I believe in your promises, but it's not what I feel right now.

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I don't feel loved by you."

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And this happens in relationships all the time.

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Some of you know.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 You're trying to have an intellectual conversation about truth.

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Do you love me?

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Right?

171
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Or something like that.

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 I'm not saying it can happen either way, but sometimes the guy says, "I love you."

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 And what does the girl say?

174
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 "Yeah, but I don't feel loved by you."

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Some of you, this is close to home.

176
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 "I don't feel it.

177
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I'm hearing the words that you're saying, but I don't feel it."

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And here's the thing.

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 When you don't feel loved by God, you have to get that love from somewhere.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Some of you have that void.

181
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Again, you would say, "I believe in God," but you don't feel loved by God.

182
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 And when you don't feel loved by God, you have to get it from someone.

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Some of you are in relationships right now where everyone in your life is saying,

184
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 "This is a toxic relationship.

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Get away from this guy.

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Get away from this girl.

187
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 What are you doing?"

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And yet you keep going back like a gravitational pull.

189
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And people are going, "What are you doing?"

190
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And you go, "I don't feel loved by God, so I have to."

191
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Maybe you wouldn't say this, but "I have to get this love from them."

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Some of you, your career, you have to get acceptance from your boss

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 or from your coworkers.

194
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 People are going, "Why are you burning yourself out?

195
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 You're going to run off a cliff."

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And you go, "I have to be accepted by them.

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 I won't be able to go to sleep at night if my boss doesn't feel like

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I've done a good job."

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Some of you, it's your parents or relationships or friends.

200
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 You're actually up at night having panic attacks, anxious,

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 because you're managing everyone's opinion of you.

202
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 That's just how you spend your life.

203
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 "Oh, she's maybe mad.

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Oh, he said that one thing.

205
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Oh, they used a period at the end of their text, so they're ticked at me."

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And you're just constantly juggling people's opinions of you.

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And you're going, "What is wrong with me?"

208
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And I just want to say maybe it's that you don't feel secure

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 in the fact that God loves you.

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Because if you did, if you felt secure,

211
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 you walked around with the confidence that God loved you,

212
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 it's like a superpower.

213
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 No one on this earth can say something that will lead to anxiety at night

214
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 because you're secure in God's love.

215
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And the first thing that we see with the people of God is they own it.

216
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 We feel forsaken. We feel forgotten.

217
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 So what does God do? How does God respond?

218
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 We see what God does is he responds with comforting words.

219
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Look at verse 15.

220
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 So they say, "The Lord's forsaken me. He's forgotten me."

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Look at what God says.

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 God says, verse 15, "Can a woman forget her nursing child

223
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?"

224
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And God says, "Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you."

225
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 So notice what God doesn't do at the beginning.

226
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 They say, "We feel forsaken by you."

227
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 God doesn't say, "Well, suck it up! A big whoop!

228
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I'm creator, you're creation, figure it out!"

229
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 But he also doesn't pander to them.

230
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 "Oh, I'm so sorry. What can I do to make it feel better?"

231
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 What God does is he actually uses an analogy, a simile,

232
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 and he says, "I want you to think."

233
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 He says, "I want you to think of a nursing mother with her baby."

234
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Which is a little weird, but this is what God says.

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 God says, "Think of a nursing mom with her little baby."

236
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 This sits very close to home for me.

237
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 We've got a one-year-old. He nurses with my wife.

238
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And God says, "My love for you, think about it,

239
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 is like a mom with her little baby, nursing her baby."

240
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And really, when you actually look into the science

241
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 behind a nursing mom, the love, the connection that goes on,

242
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 there's actually three layers to this love

243
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 of a nursing mom to her baby.

244
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 A nursing mother is giving physical love,

245
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 physical comfort to her baby.

246
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 So literally providing for the baby's physical needs.

247
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 That's the first thing.

248
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Then the nursing mom is providing emotionally.

249
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 There's actually something in the brain called oxytocin

250
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 that is released when a mom is feeding her baby

251
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 that bonds her to her baby.

252
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And then the third thing about this kind of love,

253
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 it's unconditional.

254
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 It's all give and no take.

255
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 It's all give from the mom and all take from the baby, right?

256
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 She doesn't get to the end and go,

257
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 "That's going to be $27.32 for that, no tax."

258
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 You know, that's not how that works.

259
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 It's all give.

260
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And God says, "My love for you is physical.

261
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 My love for you is emotional.

262
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 My love for you is unconditional."

263
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 But it's even more.

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 God says, "Even these may forget you,

265
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 but I will not forget you."

266
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 The truth is, as great as moms are,

267
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 some of our moms are not good moms.

268
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Some of you, a lot of you probably have great moms.

269
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Some of you would go, "Man, my mom didn't love me."

270
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And God goes, "I know."

271
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And even for those of us who had good moms,

272
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 eventually our moms will pass away and die.

273
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 But God says, "My love for you will never die.

274
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 My love will never be destroyed."

275
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 This is the truth, the amazing truth of what we sing,

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 the amazing truth of what we declare.

277
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 And it's amazing.

278
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 It's great, but it's all talk.

279
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 It's still all talk.

280
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And here's the problem with talk.

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 When all you have in a relationship is talk,

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 I love you, I love you, I love you,

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 and no action, you can conclude there's no love.

284
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Some of you, that's what you needed tonight.

285
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 That's what you needed.

286
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 If all you hear is talk, I love you, baby,

287
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 I love you, I love you, but you don't see any action,

288
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 it's all talk.

289
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And there's a sense in here where we hear these words

290
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 from God, right?

291
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 God loves you, God loves you, God loves you,

292
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 and we go, "That's great."

293
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 But that doesn't feel like,

294
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 it doesn't feel like that in my life right now.

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 It just doesn't.

296
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Talk, talk, talk, but I don't feel it.

297
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And so that's why God takes it one another level

298
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 in verse 16, where he has a powerful display of his love.

299
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Look at verse 16.

300
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 He says, "Behold," which is the Greek word for look at me,

301
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 "I have engraved you on the palms of my hands,

302
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 "and your walls are continually before me."

303
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 So he says in verse 15 that,

304
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 just like a nursing mother,

305
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 that's my love for you even more so,

306
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 but then he says, "Behold, look at me,

307
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 "I've engraved you on the palms of my hands."

308
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 This is a weird, interesting text to read

309
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 in the original language in Hebrew,

310
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 because even in their context,

311
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 it would be somewhat normal for a master,

312
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 for a master's name to be tattooed

313
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 onto a servant's arm or on their hand.

314
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 That would be somewhat normal,

315
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 but it would never be the other way around.

316
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It would never be the name of the servant

317
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 tattooed on the master's hand.

318
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 But the thing is, it doesn't say tattoo.

319
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 The word is engraved.

320
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And engraved in the Hebrew is actually the word for pierced,

321
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 with a chisel or a spike.

322
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Now why in the world would someone, out of love,

323
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 trying to display their love for someone else,

324
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 allow their palms to be pierced with a chisel or a spike?

325
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 What a horrible image.

326
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And yet, years later, there would be a man named Thomas.

327
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You know Thomas, Doubting Thomas?

328
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And Thomas is going to hear all kinds of great talk

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 about what's just happened with Jesus.

330
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 He's alive, he's risen, he's the Messiah.

331
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And what does Thomas say?

332
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Do you remember?

333
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Thomas goes, "Nah, I'm not going to believe it

334
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 "until I see it with my own eyes."

335
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And what does Jesus say to him?

336
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Jesus comes and appears before Thomas,

337
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 and he goes, "Thomas, come here.

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 "Look at the palms of my hands.

339
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 "See my love that I have for you."

340
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 This is not just talk.

341
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 This is action on a bloody cross for you.

342
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 See, 2,000 years ago, the man Jesus

343
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 that we love to sing about and talk about

344
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 and raise our hands to in this place

345
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 that every knee will bow to,

346
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 he not only was in heaven, but he took on human flesh

347
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 and he came to this earth.

348
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And he lived a perfect life

349
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 and he said a lot of words.

350
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 In fact, people called him a good teacher,

351
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 but he was so much more than that.

352
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 What Jesus came to do is not just show us

353
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 the way to God or the way to life.

354
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 He came to be the Isaiah 49, 16

355
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 fulfillment display of the love of God in your life.

356
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 When he stretched out his hands on that cross

357
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 and allowed those Roman soldiers to pierce his hands

358
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 on that cross and he suffocated to death,

359
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 he sang in that moment,

360
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 "I see you in the midst of your pain,

361
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 "your broken relationship, your failure at work,

362
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 "the insecurity that you have driving down 635 every day,

363
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 "hating traffic, hating life."

364
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 He goes, "I see you.

365
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 "And I don't just tell you that I love you.

366
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 "I'm displaying it right now."

367
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 No other religion on the planet has that.

368
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 No other religion.

369
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Our King didn't just say,

370
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 "I wanna come and have you dwell with me.

371
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 "I'm gonna display.

372
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 "I'm gonna come down and display my love for you."

373
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And for us, when we come to Jesus,

374
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 he says, "I will accept you."

375
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It's interesting.

376
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Romans chapter five, verse eight says that,

377
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 "But God demonstrates or shows,

378
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 "he demonstrates his love for us

379
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 "in that while we were sinners, Christ died for us."

380
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And then if we come to him,

381
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Jesus says in Matthew chapter 11,

382
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 he says, "Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden

383
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 "and I will give you rest."

384
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 This is what I've been praying for you.

385
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Some of you are here tonight

386
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 because it's time to release that burden

387
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 that you've been holding onto.

388
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Release it, surrender it fully to Jesus.

389
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And that's scary and that's unknown

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 and it's not gonna fix all your problems overnight,

391
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 but that kind of surrender

392
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 is what Jesus is calling us into.

393
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I mentioned my family

394
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and how I have three kids,

395
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 older daughter and then two sons.

396
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And my son, Ty, I think we have a picture of him.

397
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 This is Ty, he's three years old and he is my buddy, man.

398
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 He's my junior, you know, we named him after me,

399
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 not just 'cause I'm vain, maybe,

400
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 but because man, we just, we wanted, we just believed,

401
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 man, we wanna name him Ty.

402
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And everything about his birth was great.

403
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Everything about the delivery was great.

404
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 This was three years ago back in 2021

405
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 and he was born happy, healthy, everything was awesome.

406
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And the night after he was born, my wife's holding him

407
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and she's looking at him and she goes,

408
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 "Man, he looks a little blue,

409
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 "like his lips are a little blue.

410
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 "You think that's weird?"

411
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And typical husband, I'm like,

412
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 "Ah, babies turn weird colors, I'm sure he's fine."

413
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Okay, and then he got better and so the nurse came in

414
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and we said, "Hey, his lips were a little blue,

415
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 "but other than that, he's fine."

416
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And she kinda real serious was like,

417
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 "Hey, if that happens again, you let me know."

418
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 We're like, "Okay, okay."

419
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 So sure enough, a couple hours later, I'm holding him,

420
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 his lips turn blue again, his whole body starts to turn blue.

421
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So we call the nurse, she comes running in,

422
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 picks him up from me, shakes him, shakes him again,

423
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 and then runs out of the room without saying a word.

424
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 We're like, "What?"

425
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 You know, about five minutes later,

426
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 she comes back in with the doctor and they sit us down.

427
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 They're like, "Hey, you need to know,

428
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 "what just happened with your son is called,

429
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 "he had an apnea spell, which means he stopped breathing

430
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 "for at least 20 seconds and began to turn blue.

431
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 "We had to use some measures to bring him back."

432
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 They said, "This shouldn't be happening with a term baby,

433
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 "and so we need to monitor him in the neonatal ICU unit,

434
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 "the NICU, for the next five days."

435
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And we're like, "Ah, we're supposed to go home that next day,

436
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 "we were so excited, we had like a little party ready,

437
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 "and we're just like, 'What is going on?'"

438
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And they said, "Oh, by the way, because it's COVID,

439
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 "you have to go home at night and he has to stay here."

440
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And my wife's just like, "What? Are you kidding me?"

441
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And so we're like, "Oh, Lord,"

442
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 and I'm kind of trying to fight it, you know, like,

443
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 "Are you sure? I didn't sign anything."

444
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And we just do this whole thing, they're like,

445
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 "No, we have to monitor him, this could be really serious."

446
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 We're like, "Whatever."

447
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 So we begin the process of being in the NICU.

448
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Some of you know this world from siblings or friends, whatever.

449
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And we're going back and forth, day one, day two, day three.

450
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 The end of day three, on a Tuesday afternoon,

451
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 my wife would just be going up there back and forth all day.

452
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I remember telling her, I'm like,

453
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 "Hey, let's go home for like an hour, you need to shower, okay?

454
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 "And I'm going to cut the grass, and then we'll come right back."

455
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 We'll come right back. She's like, "All right."

456
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 So we go home.

457
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 We're not home for 15 minutes before we get a call

458
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 from the nurse practitioner.

459
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And she says, "You need to get up here right now."

460
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 We're like, "What?"

461
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 So we get in the car, we head to the hospital,

462
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 and he's hooked up to even more machines.

463
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 I think we have a picture.

464
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And they said, "Here's what happened."

465
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 They said, "Your son had another apnea spell,

466
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 "and this time we had to use artificial breath

467
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 "to bring him back.

468
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 "He was dying, and we had to bring him back."

469
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 They said, "We don't know what's going on.

470
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 "We need to give him a head ultrasound.

471
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 "We need to give him a spinal tap,

472
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 "and we may need to transfer you to another hospital."

473
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And I'm ticked.

474
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 I'm like, "What? What is going on?

475
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 "Like, no, we're getting out of here."

476
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And they look, I remember the nurse practitioner

477
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 looking me in the eyes and going, "Mr. Moffitt, listen to me."

478
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 She said, "Your son could be very sick,

479
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 "and you need to hear this, your son could die."

480
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And then they sent us out of the room to give the spinal tap.

481
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I remember my wife and I just in shock

482
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 going down to the hospital lobby,

483
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 and sitting down, and then just began to weep.

484
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Some of you have had this moment.

485
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And in our tears of just frustration and confusion

486
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 and anger and sadness,

487
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 just some words that I had memorized years earlier,

488
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Psalm 73 came over me.

489
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 It said, "Home of I in heaven, but you, God,

490
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 "there's nothing we desire besides you.

491
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 "Ty's heart and his flesh may fail,

492
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 "but God be the strength of his heart and portion forever."

493
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And then the end says, "As for me, it's good to be near God."

494
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And I don't even know if I believed those words,

495
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I just said them.

496
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And that night we went home,

497
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 and we were just incredibly sad and frustrated, went to sleep.

498
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Next morning, my wife goes straight to the hospital,

499
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 and I was like, "I just need a minute."

500
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 And I remember getting in my room, shutting the door,

501
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 and getting down on my face before God.

502
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 And having that moment that some of you have had

503
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 where I just cried out to God,

504
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 "God, what is going on?

505
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 "I'm supposed to be Ty's dad.

506
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 "I'm supposed to be his protector, his provider.

507
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 "I'd rather take trade places.

508
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 "What is going on?

509
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 "Are you in control or not?

510
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 "Are you God or not?"

511
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And just weeping like, "God, what's going on?"

512
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 And just in God's timing, I'm listening to a soundtrack

513
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 in the back in my room, and the song comes on.

514
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And the name of the song was called

515
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 "Sovereign Over Us" by Jeff Johnson.

516
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And the words just went like this.

517
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 It says, "There is strength within the sorrow.

518
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 "There is beauty in our tears.

519
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 "And you meet us in our mourning

520
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 "with a love that casts out fear.

521
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 "You are working in our waiting, sanctifying us,

522
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 "when beyond our understanding,

523
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 "you are teaching us to trust."

524
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 The chorus says this, "Your plans are still to prosper.

525
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 "You have not forgotten us.

526
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 "You are with us in the fire and in the flood.

527
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 "You are faithful forever, perfect in love.

528
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 "You are sovereign over us."

529
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And the bridge just says this,

530
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 "Even what the enemy meant for evil,

531
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 "you turn it for our good and for your glory.

532
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 "Even in the valley, you are faithful,

533
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 "and you're working for our good and for your glory."

534
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And it's hard to describe it, Porch,

535
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 but in that moment, that song going on,

536
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 all my face before God, I met God.

537
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 I had been in ministry, I'd done baptism,

538
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 I'd said the prayer, but that was the moment for me

539
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 where all that I was holding onto,

540
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 all the control that I had in my life,

541
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 that so much of my insecurity leading up

542
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 was built around that, just melted away,

543
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 and I just said, "God."

544
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 All right, you're either God or you're not God,

545
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 and I trust right now in the midst of the valley, you're God.

546
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And so, Father, if Ty never gets better, I will trust you.

547
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 And then I remember saying this,

548
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 "And God, if you take away my son's life,

549
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 "you're still good and you're still God,

550
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 "and I will worship you."

551
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I remember getting up, getting in my car,

552
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 and driving to the hospital,

553
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 and I hated that drive to the hospital, I hated it.

554
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And all of a sudden, that very drive

555
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 became a moment of worship.

556
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 And I realized for maybe the first time in my life,

557
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 my worship cost me something.

558
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Sometimes we just sing the songs, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

559
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 It was the first time I'm going, "You are good.

560
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 "You are good. Right now, you're good.

561
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 "You're on the throne. You reign.

562
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 "You are king. You're sovereign and in control."

563
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I believe that right now. I believe it.

564
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I remember parking my car, getting in the elevator.

565
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I used to hate that elevator ride up to the fourth floor.

566
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And all of a sudden, I just began to go,

567
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 "Okay, God, this is a moment of ministry.

568
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 "It's a moment of communion with God.

569
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 "So I love you. I love you. I trust you."

570
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 I would walk into that NICU room, hated that NICU room,

571
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 became a moment of seeing other people that were in that room

572
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 with worse issues than us.

573
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And all of a sudden, we began to ask them, "What's going on?"

574
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And God infused His presence into the midst of my brokenness

575
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 and our valley in a way that's hard to describe.

576
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And the end of the story is five days passed,

577
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 and he never had another apnea spell.

578
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 So they said, "Hey, look, we can't promise

579
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 "that this thing isn't going to happen again,

580
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 "but you're free to go home."

581
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And we're like, "Okay," you know?

582
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And we drove home, kind of fear and trembling,

583
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 but trusting God, and three years later,

584
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 he hasn't had another one. Praise God.

585
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Yes.

586
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 [cheers and applause]

587
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 But there's a deeper healing that went on.

588
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 You know, I praise God.

589
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Every time we look at Ty, I would just,

590
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 "Thank you, God. Thank you."

591
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And yet, the deeper thing that went on

592
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 was communion with God in the midst of the valley,

593
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 trusting that He was good, even when I didn't feel it,

594
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 knowing that beyond words, a display, a Savior's--

595
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Jesus had it, my name and yours,

596
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 engraved on His hands at the cross.

597
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 So I know some of you have walked through similar things,

598
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 and some of you have gone through harder.

599
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Some of you, the outcome didn't turn out like this.

600
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 God never promised us.

601
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 He never promised us peaches and roses.

602
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 I got lots of stories where the ending

603
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 didn't turn out like this,

604
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 and yet it's the moment of surrender

605
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 that God goes, "That's what I'm after in your life."

606
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Some of you, that's where you're at tonight.

607
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 I mean, come on. You're in the routine.

608
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 You're coming to the porch. You're singing the songs.

609
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 But you don't believe it. You don't.

610
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 You intellectually can get there,

611
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 but your mind, your heart is broken.

612
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Your mind is wandering.

613
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 You look at that same screen night after night,

614
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 pleasing yourself, going, "Why won't it stop?"

615
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 And I'm telling you, you need to meet with God.

616
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 You gotta have a moment of surrender going, "I'm done."

617
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 God, even if nothing changes, I see it.

618
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 You, your name, my name is engraved on your hands.

619
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Your love has been displayed on that bloody cross,

620
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 and I trust, no matter outcome, I trust you.

621
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 I wanna end with this quote. Ray Ortlund says this,

622
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 "Satan doesn't fear our brilliance.

623
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 He's more brilliant."

624
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 He doesn't even fear our good behavior

625
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 because he can twist morality into hypocrisy.

626
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 But what Satan fears is someone shattered,

627
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 stripped of their dreams,

628
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 so devastated that all they have left is Jesus,

629
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 and to Jesus they turn.

630
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 [applause]

631
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 And I would just say, "Orch, is that you?"

632
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Some of you have had your dreams shattered,

633
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 and yet in the midst of the broken pieces, you go,

634
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 "It's him! It's all about him!

635
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 It's all about him! It's all about him right now."

636
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 You know, this side of heaven is the only time

637
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 in the midst of brokenness we can say,

638
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 "God, right now, I wanna worship you.

639
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 I wanna worship you."

640
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 So we're gonna sing another song,

641
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 and come on, come on, some of us,

642
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 that declaration of surrender needs to happen right now.

643
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 God, I declare it. I declare it. You are good.

644
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Some of you need to come.

645
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 We're gonna have a team up here

646
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 that some of you need to get up out of your seat

647
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 and go, "I gotta talk to somebody.

648
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 I gotta tell somebody."

649
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And it's bold.

650
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 You got all of a thousand people watching you.

651
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Who cares? We're talking about Jesus.

652
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Come up here and talk to somebody,

653
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 and then worship.

654
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Give him your worship

655
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 because he is worthy of it.

656
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 So Father, we love you.

657
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 We love you. We love you.

658
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Despite what we feel,

659
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 we know this to be true.

660
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 You are good.

661
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 So have your way in our lives.

662
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 You are God.

663
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 You reign above it all.

664
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 You are king.

665
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 You are sovereign over us,

666
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 and we love you.

667
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Come, Holy Spirit.

668
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 We long to encounter a living God

669
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 who displayed his love on the cross.

670
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

671
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Come on. Come and pray. Let's go.
