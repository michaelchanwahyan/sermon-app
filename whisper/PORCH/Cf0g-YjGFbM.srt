1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,880
 - What's up guys?

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,520
 Hey, welcome everybody in the room.

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,520
 (audience cheering)

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,260
 All PortsLive locations, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Scottsdale,

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,680
 Indianapolis, all the 13 other PortsLive locations,

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,920
 we are kicking off a brand new series there.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,320
 He said it, looking at shocking statements of Jesus.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,520
 Anybody from Houston, Texas in this room?

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,640
 (audience cheering)

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,480
 Awesome.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,320
 It's my old stomping grounds.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,240
 I grew up in Houston and I grew up in a time

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,880
 where there was something called Astroworld.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,560
 Anybody remember Astroworld?

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,800
 (audience cheering)

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,840
 Man, rest in peace.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,760
 Astroworld was six flags down in Houston

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,160
 and this would be the form of entertainment

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,400
 that me and I had two brothers would go all the time

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,240
 and you go ride the rides at Astroworld.

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,560
 We just loved roller coasters, still love roller coasters.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,960
 And when you're in high school and you're growing up

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,280
 and you go ride the same rides over and over and over

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,620
 and you are a dumb male, you eventually get so bored

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,520
 that you're like, we need to make up some games

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,520
 to play on these rides.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,280
 So the game that we came up with, my older brother had,

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,240
 was that on the ride, you have to change shirts

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,480
 with the person sitting immediately next to you.

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,600
 (audience laughing)

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,440
 And there were certain rules, like only guys can play.

33
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,000
 And the ride had to be one of those

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,280
 where it had a bar that came down, not over the shoulders,

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,540
 and that you had to wait until you were over the hill

36
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,320
 and the ride had begun.

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,000
 And then there was confirmation things that had to be done

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,600
 where you had to confirm, like do you have the shirt?

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,040
 Confirm, I have the shirt.

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,600
 One of us is not leaving, or if it goes somewhere,

41
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,840
 one of us is leaving without a shirt.

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,680
 It ain't gonna be me.

43
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,520
 So we came up with all this stuff,

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,840
 and as you would have it,

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,960
 eventually you do that enough times

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,400
 and that gets kind of boring too.

47
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,680
 So to mix it up, one day I was there with a friend

48
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,600
 and we did this game, we're laughing, it's fun.

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,800
 It's again, it's what dumb high school boys do.

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
 And he had the idea, we should do a full clothes switch.

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,640
 (audience laughing)

52
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,760
 Shirt, shorts, shoes, everything but undergarments.

53
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,600
 And it was like, man, that is bold, that is, oh, let's do it.

54
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,640
 We go on the ride, we get ready to the ride,

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,840
 had it all planned out.

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
 There was a flip in the ride, there were different turns,

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
 and we're going through the process,

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,240
 and we get over the hill, click, click, click, click, click,

59
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,280
 woo, and we're on the ride, things begun.

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,760
 Begin to go through, get up the shirt off.

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,200
 It's just such a terrible story.

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,760
 Get the shirt off, hand him the shirt,

63
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,320
 confirm you have the shirt, he has the shirt.

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,120
 Gets the shirt, we're going through the ride,

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,080
 we begin to work through the shorts,

66
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,600
 and you're trying to shimmy underneath,

67
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,280
 you had to lift your legs up a little bit

68
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,080
 to keep that bar from going all the way down

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,120
 to give you enough wiggle room to maneuver.

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,680
 And going through that maneuver,

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
 get the basketball shorts, hand him the basketball shorts,

72
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,320
 get his shorts, and I realize I've got a problem.

73
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,240
 He was wearing not basketball shorts, but jean shorts,

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,800
 which are much more difficult to do

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
 when you're working with three inches of real estate

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,240
 as you're going on this ride.

77
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,840
 And so I'm like, oh man, this is not going good.

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,680
 Trying to get these pants, trying to get these pants up

79
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,600
 as I'm going on the ride, and we're going around the turn,

80
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,920
 and I'm realizing, man, I've got like 20 seconds left.

81
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,480
 I've got to get these things up.

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,680
 And we go around another turn, we come in,

83
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,540
 and I didn't make it.

84
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,200
 (audience laughing)

85
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,680
 And so I have to stand up, pull up my pants

86
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,080
 in front of lines of people as I walk off

87
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,240
 in another man's shorts as people are like

88
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,480
 hiding their kids' eyes, like what kind of ride is this?

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,040
 (audience laughing)

90
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,560
 And on every roller coaster ride,

91
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,320
 there was a place where they take your picture

92
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,360
 in the middle of the ride.

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,600
 (audience laughing)

94
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,480
 You guys have seen it before.

95
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,960
 So we were like, man, that was legendary.

96
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,320
 Let's go see where the picture was taken

97
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,160
 and what that looked like.

98
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,960
 And we go up and I get to the kiosk

99
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,160
 where there's a lady behind,

100
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,520
 and you have like six different pictures

101
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,280
 of each of the different carts.

102
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,880
 And one of those where our cart would have been,

103
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,000
 there was no picture, it was a black box

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,520
 with a red X over it.

105
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,400
 (audience laughing)

106
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,880
 And I asked the lady, 'cause I was like,

107
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,600
 man, we don't buy this kind of a funny memory.

108
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,480
 And so I'm like, hey, what happened to that one?

109
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,080
 She's like, sir, inappropriate conduct.

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,520
 And I was like, man, but do you think we could buy it

111
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,360
 from you?

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,400
 And she's like, no, you cannot buy it from me.

113
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,280
 It's inappropriate conduct.

114
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
 You're lucky I'm not having you thrown out of the park

115
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,360
 right now for change your clothes

116
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,720
 and decent exposure on that ride.

117
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,280
 And I was like, all right, have a nice day.

118
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,200
 Okay, let's go.

119
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,240
 What does that have to do with this brand new series?

120
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,480
 Well, in that instance, it was clear

121
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,960
 that the conduct that was behaved

122
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,960
 or our conduct was deemed inappropriate conduct.

123
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,560
 And Jesus, over and over and over throughout scripture,

124
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,000
 in a much more serious way,

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,200
 lays out that when it comes to you and I

126
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,080
 as followers of Christ,

127
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,520
 there is an appropriate conduct that is meant to mark us.

128
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,600
 And the consequences for not living out

129
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,320
 that appropriate conduct are much more significant

130
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
 than not getting a picture at Six Flags.

131
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,360
 They're much more connected to the purpose

132
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,960
 that you and I as the church are here.

133
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,320
 And we're gonna kick off a teaching that he had

134
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,160
 that was radical in the first century

135
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,880
 and is equally as radical when it's lived out today.

136
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
 And the conduct that we're gonna talk about

137
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,880
 relates to love.

138
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,080
 Now, love is one of those words that everybody would say,

139
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,520
 like, I love, and we all love things,

140
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,080
 and it's almost become watered down.

141
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,880
 Like, I love my kids, love my wife,

142
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,800
 I love nitro brew from Starbucks,

143
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,440
 I love Audible books, I love Chick-fil-A sauce,

144
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,560
 whatever they put in that sauce, man.

145
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,000
 There's a bunch of things that I would say,

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,560
 man, these are things that I love.

147
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,260
 And you've got your own list, too.

148
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,240
 And Jesus would say, there is a specific group of people

149
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,360
 you are to add to your list of things that you love,

150
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,520
 and it is not optional.

151
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
 Specifically, we're talking about tonight

152
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,820
 on There He Said It, the shocking teachings of Jesus,

153
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,080
 that Jesus commanded that if you are gonna follow him,

154
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,520
 you and I must love our enemies.

155
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,320
 Whatever's on the list of things that you love,

156
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,800
 Jesus would say, it is not finished until you add to it

157
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 loving your enemies.

158
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
 We're gonna look at a passage in Matthew chapter five

159
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
 where Jesus walks through and gives us, really,

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,120
 the command and the call that you and I

161
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,840
 are to love people that don't love us back,

162
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,360
 to love parents that hurt us,

163
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,920
 to love coworkers that mistreat us,

164
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,320
 to love people that judge us because of the way that we look,

165
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,120
 to love people that hurt us and that harm us,

166
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,640
 to love even people, he's gonna say, that hate you.

167
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,020
 In my lifetime, I don't know that there's ever been a time

168
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,160
 where this message has been more important

169
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,040
 in terms of the world around us and the division

170
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,600
 and the tribalism and the hatred and the venom

171
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,760
 that has poured out that social media

172
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,000
 has only made worse and worse.

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,280
 And tragically, how a lot of the way of thinking

174
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,720
 that the world, 'cause if you're in the world,

175
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,960
 you should hate people and you should draw lines

176
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,640
 and you should treat people poorly,

177
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,240
 and if people treat you poorly, you should respond in kind,

178
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,540
 unless you're a Christian.

179
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,880
 And Jesus is gonna say that for anyone

180
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,120
 who wants to follow him, they are called to love

181
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,600
 those who hurt them, those who harm them,

182
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,360
 those who hate them, or said otherwise,

183
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,480
 to love their enemies.

184
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,680
 And if you and I and every person just in this room

185
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,640
 will begin to live out that teaching,

186
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,520
 it's gonna change your world and it's gonna change

187
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,760
 the city that we live in and the city of every place

188
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,800
 that is listening right now, as the body of Christ

189
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,060
 embraces the radical teaching of Jesus.

190
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,800
 And so I'm gonna look at Matthew chapter five with you,

191
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
 we're gonna walk through three things of how Jesus says

192
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,880
 to respond to those who hurt you, those who hate you,

193
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,840
 those who harm you.

194
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,680
 Found in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount,

195
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,600
 as we've covered before, Jesus gave the most famous sermon

196
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,880
 in human history, Matthew chapter five, six, and seven.

197
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,280
 It's incredible, it's powerful, beautiful,

198
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,720
 and in it he covers a lot of topics,

199
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,320
 and one that he covers is how you and I

200
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,160
 are to relate to people, and the radical idea

201
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,320
 of you are called to love even those who hate you,

202
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
 or love your enemies.

203
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,320
 So I'm gonna start in verse 38,

204
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,280
 and we will walk through, he says this.

205
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,800
 Matthew chapter five, verse 38.

206
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,320
 You have heard it said, Jesus talking to this crowd

207
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,360
 of people on a mountainside.

208
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,640
 You've heard people tell you that an eye for an eye,

209
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840
 and a tooth for a tooth.

210
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,960
 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.

211
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,920
 If anyone slaps you on the right cheek,

212
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,520
 turn to them the other cheek also.

213
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,220
 If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt,

214
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,800
 hand over your coat as well.

215
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
 Jesus, what are you saying?

216
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,840
 Jesus brings up, at that day, there was a system of justice

217
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,120
 or a way of thinking about it,

218
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
 an eye for an eye was basically like,

219
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,360
 hey, if you cause somebody to lose their eye,

220
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,240
 you lose their eyes.

221
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
 In other words, a standard of justice

222
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,160
 that you repay harm equal to the harm that was created.

223
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,760
 It was common, it's the way everyone thought.

224
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,840
 You get even.

225
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,240
 If there's somebody that does you wrong,

226
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,040
 there's a girl who breaks girl code,

227
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,480
 starts dating your old boyfriend,

228
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,980
 or the guy that you knew you liked,

229
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,200
 man, you got bad blood, she is out.

230
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,280
 That's how you treat her.

231
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,180
 You got a parent that was not anything like

232
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,480
 what God says parents should be when you were growing up.

233
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,280
 You finally out of the house, you cut 'em off.

234
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,400
 You get payback, you get retaliation.

235
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,160
 And Jesus tells his followers,

236
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,100
 you've heard retaliation is the type of justice

237
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
 you should look for.

238
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,860
 But I tell you something altogether different.

239
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,640
 That if somebody slaps you on the cheek,

240
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,440
 you're to turn the other cheek to them.

241
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,540
 I'm gonna explain and expound what I mean.

242
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,160
 But Jesus is introducing that if you follow him,

243
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,400
 you will look radically different than what comes natural

244
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,700
 in terms of when you are wronged, I wanna get even.

245
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,680
 Not that there still won't be a natural thing inside of you

246
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,760
 that wants vengeance or justice or payback,

247
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,900
 you just don't choose to follow it.

248
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,020
 We're born really naturally with having something

249
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,560
 inside of us that when we're wrong,

250
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,000
 we just come back swinging, just as human nature.

251
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,820
 It's just natural.

252
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,400
 I see this really clearly with my kids.

253
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,600
 I've got a five-year-old and a three-year-old.

254
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,240
 Five-year-old son named Crew

255
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,920
 and a three-year-old daughter named Monroe.

256
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,240
 I think we even have a picture of them.

257
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,240
 And these two all the time will just throw hands.

258
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,840
 Our whole life is like, separate, the two of you.

259
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,720
 Stop hitting your sister, stop hitting your brother.

260
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
 The other day we're outside, we're playing Family Olympics.

261
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,640
 Dad of the year, Family Olympics, okay?

262
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,160
 Olympics are coming up, Team USA, let's do this.

263
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,220
 Got five different events, we're playing the event.

264
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,560
 My son stubs his toe, which hurts when you're five or 35.

265
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,840
 Stubs his toe, he's over there jumping, he's crying,

266
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,480
 tear ducts just going full send.

267
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,360
 My sister, or his sister comes up,

268
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,240
 he's like giving him a big hug.

269
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,440
 He goes, boom, pushes her right on the ground.

270
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,000
 It's like such a sweet moment, it's like,

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,260
 oh man, so sweet, boom, and she jumps up.

272
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,160
 She starts swinging at him like she's in Rocky.

273
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,000
 I'm like, oh my, all right, well cancel the Olympics.

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,120
 We can't have any family time together.

275
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,720
 But this is constantly, it's just what they do.

276
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,880
 Man, you hit me, I'm gonna come back swinging at you.

277
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,800
 It's human nature.

278
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,560
 And sadly, most people never grow out of that,

279
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,820
 that there's something inside of all of us

280
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,600
 that just even feels justified.

281
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,660
 You hurt me, I'm going to hurt you back.

282
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,140
 And Jesus says, man, that's okay,

283
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,080
 unless you're a follower of him.

284
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:16,120
 And then in the face of hurt, being harmed,

285
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,660
 you don't seek retaliation, you seek reconciliation.

286
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,840
 First idea I wanna talk about is what Jesus lays out,

287
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,340
 which is a pretty powerful idea,

288
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,020
 a Christian's response to those who harm them

289
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,280
 is forgiveness.

290
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,460
 A Christian's response to those who harm them

291
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,280
 is forgiveness.

292
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,800
 When he brings up the idea of turning the other cheek,

293
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,020
 he's not saying take there and take abuse,

294
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,800
 or else he would say just take it on the same cheek.

295
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,580
 The Jewish metaphor that he's using,

296
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
 of the metaphor would have been,

297
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,780
 in turning the other cheek, you are starting fresh,

298
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,340
 starting a new relationship.

299
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,860
 I'm choosing not to hold the harm that you have done to me,

300
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,560
 and he's not literally talking about

301
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,700
 somebody slapping you on the face,

302
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,140
 he's talking about the idea of forgiveness.

303
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,060
 You have harmed me, I am going to start fresh

304
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,300
 by forgiving you.

305
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,420
 I'm going to extend forgiveness when I'm hurt.

306
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,000
 What is forgiveness?

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,780
 Let me lay out what it is and then what it isn't.

308
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,820
 Forgiveness, biblically, according to Matthew chapter 18,

309
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,580
 Romans chapter 12, first Peter chapter two,

310
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,140
 is releasing, this is what forgiveness,

311
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,420
 how do you know when you've forgiven somebody?

312
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,420
 It is releasing the demand for justice to God.

313
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,260
 What is biblical forgiveness?

314
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,420
 Or what is forgiveness biblically?

315
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,060
 It is they wronged me, it's not pretending it didn't happen,

316
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:46,060
 it is releasing the demand for justice to get even to God.

317
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:52,340
 That every sin was paid for on the cross by Jesus,

318
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,420
 or will be paid for for all of eternity

319
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,180
 by that person in hell.

320
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,380
 But there's a lot of misconceptions

321
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,660
 around what forgiveness is.

322
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,620
 Forgiveness is not excusing sin.

323
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,420
 It's not saying, oh, that's okay, you cheated on me.

324
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,700
 It's not that big of a deal, it's a huge deal.

325
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,620
 Sin is such a big deal to God that he had to die for it.

326
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,820
 So it's not excusing sin or pretending that it's okay.

327
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,980
 Forgiveness is not forgetting.

328
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,540
 You hear like, oh, you just forgive, you forget,

329
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,060
 as though, man, I'm not even there anymore.

330
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,020
 In order to forgive, you have to remember

331
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,700
 and say, I'm not holding that against you.

332
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,700
 I'm not pretending like it didn't happen.

333
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,860
 But I'm choosing to release the demand for payback,

334
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,680
 to release the debt that was created,

335
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,100
 to release what you owe me, 'cause you hurt me.

336
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,740
 I release that to God.

337
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,180
 Forgiveness is not denying hurt or anger.

338
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,140
 You should be hurt.

339
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,900
 Some of you guys were so deeply wounded

340
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,660
 by what a family member did to you,

341
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,060
 and it was wrong.

342
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,100
 It may have even been abuse.

343
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,180
 God didn't want that.

344
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,860
 He did cause that.

345
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,300
 It wasn't your fault.

346
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,380
 And you forgiving someone doesn't mean,

347
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,940
 man, I'm just gonna pretend like I'm not hurt.

348
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,300
 You should be hurt.

349
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,620
 You should be angry over sin.

350
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,540
 God was, to the point where he would send his son.

351
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,120
 And finally, forgiveness is not conditional.

352
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,620
 For the believer, you and I are called to forgive,

353
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,860
 even if they don't accept it, understand it,

354
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,160
 even if they're not present.

355
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,300
 God has commanded in Matthew chapter 18,

356
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,460
 you and I are to forgive up to 70 times seven,

357
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,300
 or over and over and over.

358
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,460
 The forgiveness is not conditional.

359
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,220
 It is releasing the demand for justice to God.

360
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,700
 It is forgiving as God has forgiven us.

361
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,140
 There's not a person in this room, including myself,

362
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,620
 who has been sinned against more

363
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,260
 than every one of us sinned against God today,

364
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,620
 through your thoughts, through your actions,

365
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,060
 through your words, that all of us have sinned,

366
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,920
 not just against other people and hurt other people,

367
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,720
 we have sinned against God.

368
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,700
 And he has called us to forgive as God in Christ said,

369
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,040
 man, everything you've done, I covered it.

370
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,580
 It's forgiven.

371
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,260
 My death on the cross, it's paid for.

372
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,060
 That's how I forgive you.

373
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,340
 And that's how I call you to forgive others.

374
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,300
 It's not saying stay in an abusive relationship.

375
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,100
 And when Paul talks about this idea

376
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,060
 of loving your enemies in Romans chapter 12 and Romans 13,

377
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,860
 he then goes into the role of government,

378
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,580
 which is there to protect, to bring about peace.

379
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,180
 And so if you're in an abusive environment relationship,

380
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,540
 the Bible is not saying just stay in that,

381
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,420
 say get out, stop enabling that abuse.

382
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,220
 It is talking about when somebody hurts you,

383
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,220
 you and I have been called to forgive them,

384
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,860
 to release that demand for justice to God.

385
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,820
 How do I forgive?

386
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,820
 First thing, if you can overlook an offense,

387
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,420
 you should overlook it.

388
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,780
 Biblically, the Bible says that,

389
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,000
 hey, when it comes to forgiving,

390
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,500
 there's certain things and certain steps

391
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,740
 that you walk through to do it.

392
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,180
 The first thing would be like, man,

393
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,220
 can I just overlook this?

394
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,420
 Do I need to go through the process

395
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,120
 and choose to cancel the debt

396
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,620
 or initiate a conversation with them and their believer?

397
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,460
 Or can I just kind of overlook it?

398
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,780
 Proverbs chapter 19 verse 11 says,

399
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,740
 it is to one's glory to overlook an offense.

400
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,500
 It is a glorious thing to be able to go,

401
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,560
 you know what, they didn't call me back,

402
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,220
 I'm believing the best, life happens,

403
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,620
 people get busy, it's cool.

404
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,860
 It is a glorious thing to be able to overlook.

405
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,100
 So first, can you overlook it?

406
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,060
 How do you know if you can overlook it?

407
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,600
 Well, if you're not able to move past it

408
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,700
 and it keeps coming back,

409
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,580
 you probably are not able to overlook it.

410
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,420
 What do I mean?

411
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,860
 Like it's like this, anytime you eat food

412
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,500
 or there's certain foods that you've eaten before,

413
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
 I've eaten before, and you're like,

414
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,940
 man, that something is not right here.

415
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,380
 And you're in that middle ground where you're like,

416
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,780
 is this food poisoning?

417
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,380
 Is my next 24 hours about to be totally different

418
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,420
 than I had planned?

419
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,300
 Or is this just gonna like,

420
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,360
 man, I don't, it's kind of just feel weird,

421
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,140
 but it's gonna pass.

422
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,420
 And there's times you eventually reach a threshold

423
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,900
 where you're like, it is not passing,

424
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,260
 it is coming back up, I'm gonna see this again.

425
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,980
 In the same way, when it comes to those hurts, offenses,

426
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,060
 if you find yourself driving along the road

427
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,620
 and you're replaying the tape and replaying the tape

428
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,780
 and walking back through,

429
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,740
 and I can't believe they always and they never,

430
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,100
 it's time for you to recognize you can't overlook it.

431
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,060
 You need to choose to forgive it.

432
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,940
 How do you else forgive?

433
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,060
 The Bible says that we do this as Christians quickly.

434
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,300
 We keep what's called short accounts, or I move quick.

435
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,820
 Once I know I can't overlook it,

436
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,260
 I'm gonna go and I'm gonna say, if they're a believer,

437
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,660
 hey, this is how you hurt me.

438
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,820
 Ephesians chapter four talks about,

439
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,740
 Ephesians chapter five,

440
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,740
 not letting the sun go down on your angle,

441
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,820
 which is the principle of just,

442
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,700
 hey, you move quickly to resolve hurts

443
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,500
 with other believers in your life.

444
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,660
 If they are a believer, you go to them

445
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,540
 and you tell them, you hurt me.

446
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,860
 If you can't overlook it,

447
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,980
 it's gonna cause a barrier in your relationship.

448
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,820
 So when somebody hurts you, you move towards them,

449
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,420
 and if they're another Christian,

450
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,420
 you go to them and you seek to be reconciled,

451
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,680
 which means you go and you share, this is how I was hurt.

452
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,080
 While doing so, you own your part.

453
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,340
 Hey, I need to ask for your forgiveness

454
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,960
 for blank, blank, blank.

455
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,240
 But when you say, this is how you hurt me,

456
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,880
 or you bring up how you were hurt

457
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,720
 in order to extend forgiveness,

458
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,480
 you focus, this is really, really, really important.

459
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,080
 When you do that, you focus on the specific action

460
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,720
 that they took and the emotion it created in you.

461
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,680
 In other words, hey, it really hurt me

462
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,920
 when you said you were having all your best friends together

463
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,240
 at the house to hang out, and I didn't get a phone call.

464
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,520
 Action, and that phone call not happening

465
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,800
 made me feel like you don't care about me.

466
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,960
 Emotion, it created.

467
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,000
 It really hurt me whenever somebody told me

468
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,680
 that you had been gossiping about me behind my back.

469
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,200
 Is that true?

470
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,360
 That gossip really hurt me because it made me feel

471
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,860
 like I can't trust you.

472
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,420
 You focus on the specific action

473
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,700
 and the specific emotion that it created.

474
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,820
 You don't focus on character,

475
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,060
 like this is just who you are.

476
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,900
 You're a bad apple.

477
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,220
 You always do this kind of thing.

478
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,060
 You know what?

479
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,900
 I knew this is who you are.

480
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,820
 You don't focus on attacking their character.

481
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,460
 You don't focus on the past.

482
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,140
 You focus on the specific action

483
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,520
 and the emotion it created in you.

484
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,940
 And say, that hurt me.

485
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,020
 And if they're a believer,

486
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,420
 hopefully they're able to look and say,

487
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,720
 will you please forgive me?

488
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,340
 And as it depends on you,

489
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,220
 if you're in that scenario,

490
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,420
 it's your responsibility

491
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,980
 and call from Christ to forgive those

492
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,340
 even when they've hurt you.

493
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,300
 The Bible teaches,

494
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,620
 retaliation is not a sign of strength.

495
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,800
 In other words, getting even is not a sign of strength.

496
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,700
 It is a sign of weakness.

497
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,880
 That it is a sign of strength to extend forgiveness,

498
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,220
 to ask for forgiveness,

499
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,020
 and that you and I, as Christians,

500
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,220
 the response to those who hurt us,

501
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,860
 is to forgive.

502
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,740
 Paul says this in Romans chapter 12,

503
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,580
 talking about the same thing.

504
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,560
 Repay no one evil for evil.

505
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,500
 Give thought to what is honorable in the sight of all.

506
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 If possible, so far as it depends on you,

507
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,020
 live peaceably with everyone.

508
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,480
 Beloved, I want you to think about this verse.

509
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,900
 In a culture, in a world,

510
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,500
 that screams for justice,

511
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,480
 screams for justice because they are made

512
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,880
 in the image of God,

513
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,840
 and God put inside of every human heart

514
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,760
 a desire for justice.

515
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,780
 But that desire for justice leads them

516
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,000
 to come out swinging and attacking other people,

517
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,360
 and the Bible says that is never the road to justice

518
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,920
 or vengeance.

519
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,320
 It says, never avenge yourselves.

520
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,020
 That's crazy.

521
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,140
 Never avenge yourselves.

522
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,820
 Wait, Paul, you mean never?

523
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,660
 Like, you know, what about a couple times when you--

524
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,580
 Never avenge yourself.

525
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,480
 Leave it to the wrath of God.

526
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,740
 For it is written, vengeance is mine.

527
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,620
 I will repay, says the Lord.

528
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,620
 I was reading this week,

529
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,620
 and maybe the most powerful recent example

530
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,180
 of what I was reading was recent,

531
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,600
 of something that happened about six years ago

532
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,900
 in 2015 in Charleston.

533
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,520
 And it was one of a man who quoted the verse

534
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,240
 that I just read.

535
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,480
 He was a man who, in 2015,

536
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,140
 there was a shooting,

537
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,020
 and a horrific act of evil took place,

538
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,240
 where a young man went into a church

539
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,360
 where people were having Bible study

540
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
 and worshiping God.

541
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,440
 And with hatred in his heart,

542
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,040
 he shot at people just worshiping God.

543
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,500
 And victim after victim killed.

544
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,540
 There were nine of them that were killed

545
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,360
 at St. Emmanuel's in Charleston, South Carolina.

546
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,380
 And each of those victims left behind family,

547
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,300
 and some of the family, in the aftermath,

548
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,860
 spoke directly to the killer

549
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,660
 and gave one of the most powerful examples

550
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,660
 of what Christians do in the face of horrific,

551
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,880
 horrific evil, and they forgive.

552
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,960
 Here's one of the men who lost his wife.

553
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,160
 His wife was killed.

554
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,640
 He looked at the murderer in the face,

555
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,680
 in the courtroom, and he said this.

556
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,280
 I want you to know, I forgive you, son,

557
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,500
 and my family forgives you,

558
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,320
 but we would like you to take this opportunity

559
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,420
 to repent, repent, confess,

560
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,060
 and give your life to the one who matters most,

561
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,340
 Jesus Christ, so that he can change it,

562
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,940
 and he can change your attitude.

563
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,280
 It's breathtaking.

564
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,580
 In the face of hours after you killed my wife,

565
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,400
 he says, I forgive you,

566
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,840
 and I hope that God has mercy on you.

567
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,960
 Years later, he was asked, four years later,

568
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,800
 do you regret doing that or saying that?

569
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,340
 That's what he said.

570
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,380
 The man was asked, four years later,

571
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,300
 if he had any second thoughts.

572
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,620
 He said, I always get asked that.

573
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,900
 People want to know why, even if he did repent,

574
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,900
 why would I ever forgive the man who murdered my wife?

575
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,340
 My answer to them is always the same.

576
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,180
 I chose to forgive the racist killer

577
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,580
 because I believe and trust God's word

578
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,580
 when he tells me vengeance is God's to repay, not mine.

579
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,640
 I need not avenge the vile deeds of this killer.

580
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,240
 It is mine to avenge.

581
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,580
 I will repay the scripture promised me, God says.

582
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,520
 Christians in the face of harm, forgive.

583
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,520
 Verse 41, Jesus continues.

584
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,680
 If anyone forces you to go one mile

585
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,160
 and goes with them two miles,

586
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
 oh, I'm sorry, go with them two miles,

587
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,200
 give to the one who asked of you,

588
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,320
 and do not turn away from the one who went as far to you.

589
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,720
 At this point, my guest, Jesus,

590
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,800
 teaching this crowd of people, the audience gasps

591
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,660
 'cause what did Jesus just say?

592
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,100
 Well, he's not just saying,

593
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,800
 hey, if anyone wants to go one mile on a walk, go two,

594
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,420
 do a 5K, he's pointing out a specific Roman law,

595
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,460
 at this time, Rome ruled the known world,

596
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,060
 and Rome would go in and they would basically conquer

597
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,500
 through strength and might and oppress people

598
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,540
 that were there, and they had a law

599
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,260
 that any non-Roman citizen, which is the vast majority

600
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,460
 of the world that they'd conquered, were not Roman citizens.

601
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,200
 Any non-Roman citizen, a Roman soldier,

602
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,800
 could come up and say, hey, for the next mile,

603
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,560
 you carry my armor, and every citizen was obligated,

604
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,280
 I have to go with them, so in other words,

605
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
 think about that in your life.

606
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,480
 You're trying to make plans,

607
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,200
 you're running out the door to work,

608
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
 you're supposed to meet people at dinner,

609
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,480
 and in the first century, you're on your way to dinner,

610
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,560
 Roman soldier grabs you, and you're walking a mile

611
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,460
 out of your way, and then you gotta walk a mile

612
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,360
 just to come back and join friends at P. Delicious

613
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,040
 or wherever they were eating food that night

614
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,120
 where you were supposed to meet 'em,

615
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,080
 and it just totally derails your plans.

616
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,040
 And Jesus says, hey, when they do that,

617
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,720
 and I know everyone in here, you hate Rome.

618
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,240
 The racial tension and division was far even stronger

619
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,680
 or as strong, not stronger in terms of the brute

620
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:00,040
 and the brutality of Rome, and Jesus said, hey,

621
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,840
 when they ask you to go a mile, go two.

622
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,200
 Radical new lifestyle that Jesus was calling

623
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,640
 his people to live out.

624
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,280
 He said, you've heard it said, love your neighbor

625
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,440
 and hate your enemy, but I tell you,

626
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,440
 love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,

627
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,200
 that you may be children of your Father in heaven,

628
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,340
 who sends the rain on the righteous and the unrighteous,

629
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,600
 if you love only those who love you,

630
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,800
 what reward will you get?

631
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,240
 Or not even tax collectors doing that.

632
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,680
 And if you only greet your own people,

633
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,720
 what are you doing more than others?

634
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,920
 Don't even pagans or people who do not know God.

635
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,280
 Jesus just said, a Christian's response

636
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,440
 to those who hate them is love.

637
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,200
 Second idea from the text, a Christian's response

638
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,800
 to those who hurt them is forgiveness.

639
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,520
 A Christian's response to those who hate them is love.

640
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,440
 That he said, even to your enemies, I want you to love them.

641
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,440
 I want you to, when somebody is attacking you,

642
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,840
 I want you to pray for them.

643
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,520
 How much would the world change if every person

644
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,640
 who claimed to be a Christian said,

645
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,080
 I don't care what you do to me, I'm gonna love you.

646
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,720
 I'm gonna pray for you.

647
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,360
 I'm gonna give to you.

648
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,420
 And you can attack me, you can write me off,

649
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,280
 you can call me a bigot, you can do whatever you want,

650
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,680
 but I'm gonna pray for you.

651
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,640
 Jesus said, if you are gonna follow me,

652
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,760
 your response in the face of hate is love.

653
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,720
 Who are we to love?

654
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,320
 Jesus said, even your enemies.

655
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,920
 Here's the burden that I feel for this message.

656
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,920
 Just try to be as real and articulate

657
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,620
 the heaviness that I feel.

658
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,400
 We live in a time that is so divided.

659
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:12,560
 And there's a world where there's industries

660
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:19,260
 that literally are committed to creating outrage

661
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,880
 and division and tribes and dividing and separating

662
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,100
 based on sex, based on your sexuality,

663
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,680
 based on the color of your skin,

664
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,400
 based on the class that you're a part of,

665
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,160
 based on the story that you have,

666
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,520
 and trying to pit people against each other and attack,

667
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,360
 all of which is not new.

668
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,480
 It's amplified because of the interconnectedness

669
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,980
 in the world in which we live.

670
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:51,240
 What is also not new but is toxic

671
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,120
 is any time that worldly line of thinking,

672
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,960
 which is, man, I'm gonna divide you, I'm gonna see you,

673
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
 I'm gonna break things down,

674
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
 I'm gonna hold things against you,

675
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,520
 I'm gonna put you in a specific box,

676
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,640
 hold it against you,

677
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,800
 when that line of thinking bleeds into the church,

678
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,180
 it is toxic and it is happening.

679
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,720
 And Jesus says, like, let me write out

680
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,240
 in a way that I know, candidly,

681
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,680
 some of you guys are just gonna write me off

682
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,240
 'cause of the color of my skin.

683
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,620
 If you hold animosity or hatred or bitter

684
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,740
 bitterness towards any person,

685
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:38,580
 you don't look like Jesus, you look like the world.

686
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,460
 And may, I ask, is the way that you see yourself,

687
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,580
 see your group, see people,

688
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,580
 more informed by the world around you or the word of God?

689
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,120
 If you are a Christian, there is no group

690
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,660
 that has a stronger connection

691
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,820
 or you are a part of no group

692
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,980
 that is more important than the fact that you

693
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,980
 and all of us who are followers of Jesus are one family.

694
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,140
 And the world around you is gonna sell the lie

695
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,060
 as they always do.

696
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,660
 Satan's primary job, always has been, always will be,

697
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,620
 is to divide.

698
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,940
 John chapter 10 says, he came to divide.

699
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,800
 You see division, that's him winning.

700
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:23,580
 Racial prejudice is divisive.

701
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,300
 If that needs to be said, will you forgive me?

702
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,240
 Any person who divides based on the color of skin

703
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,620
 is not operating underneath the principles of Jesus

704
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,340
 but of the world.

705
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,700
 And that goes in any direction.

706
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,940
 And he says, you and I, even if they are the worst

707
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,760
 of the worst, you're to love them.

708
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,020
 And he says specifically how to love them.

709
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,980
 And he introduces prayer.

710
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,820
 He says that you and I are to pray for them.

711
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,540
 Imagine what your life this week would look like.

712
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,940
 And maybe just the person that is such a jerk to you

713
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,180
 at the office and you just go in, you're gonna decide,

714
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,400
 you know what, I'm gonna start every day praying

715
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,060
 for this person and not praying, God, will you smite them

716
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,420
 and take them out so I can have their job.

717
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,120
 I'm gonna start praying, God, will you bless this person?

718
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,820
 Will you get a hold of their heart?

719
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,260
 God, will you save this person?

720
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,080
 Like they hold against me the fact that I'm a Christian,

721
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,420
 the fact that I follow you.

722
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,500
 I know that they treat me different

723
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 and I know that they, honestly, they kind of make fun of me

724
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,460
 but God, I just wanna pray for them.

725
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,580
 I wanna pray for the family member

726
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,460
 that really, really hurt me.

727
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,580
 I wanna pray for the friends that I feel like

728
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,240
 they just totally turned their back on me.

729
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,660
 God, I wanna pray, would you bless them?

730
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,140
 When Jesus' audience heard prayer,

731
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,460
 they would have thought of the Jewish prayer of the day

732
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,020
 which is Lord, will you bless them and keep them,

733
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,480
 make your face shine on them.

734
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,420
 This week, when you feel that rising up to go,

735
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,980
 man, I cannot believe the Christian response is to say,

736
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,960
 God, I'm gonna pray for that person.

737
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,900
 I'm gonna pray that you'd get a hold of their heart,

738
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,660
 that if there's areas of their heart

739
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,340
 and they are a Christian,

740
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,140
 maybe they could more fully yield to you.

741
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,940
 I'm gonna pray that you would allow that to happen

742
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,820
 'cause a Christian's response to those who hate them,

743
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,980
 who hurt them, is to love.

744
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,740
 Paul would say this in that same passage in Romans 12.

745
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,660
 He said, if your enemy is hungry,

746
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,460
 think about how radical this is.

747
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,740
 To us, we kinda read it and you're like,

748
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,060
 oh, that's so nice and not really practical.

749
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,740
 He says, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.

750
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,280
 If he's thirsty, give him something to drink.

751
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,580
 By doing so, you'll keep burning coals on his head.

752
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,300
 Don't overcome evil by evil, but overcome evil with good.

753
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:52,300
 Our world is so, again, my heart breaks for the church

754
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,900
 because the world has always been this way.

755
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,580
 When the church starts going,

756
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,660
 hey, you're over here, you're over here, it's tragic.

757
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,260
 And there's a lot of believers that

758
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,580
 the mark or the conduct of their life,

759
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,060
 it doesn't look different from the world.

760
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,860
 They're more influenced by the way the world

761
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:17,060
 tells them to think than the word of God says they should.

762
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,540
 Like this, my five-year-old son plays YMCA soccer

763
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,740
 and we'll go to the games and was coaching a soccer team

764
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,420
 and we went to a game and I got there early

765
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,180
 and saw the game that was going on before us.

766
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,580
 And the YMCA, because it's five-year-old soccer

767
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,820
 and I don't know who they put over that,

768
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,820
 but had two teams that had the same color jersey.

769
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,340
 And five-year-old soccer is already pretty chaotic

770
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,460
 where it's like, hey, Bobby, no, get back over here.

771
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,860
 Pull your pants up, get over here.

772
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,380
 But when both teams have the same color jersey,

773
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,580
 it's like, okay, we just call this a draw

774
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,900
 and go get Capri Sun 'cause this is no point in playing.

775
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,940
 'Cause they can't tell, nobody stands out.

776
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,780
 There's no difference.

777
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,600
 I can't tell the difference

778
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,300
 between who's on my team and who's not.

779
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,300
 And tragically, when it comes to the topic of love

780
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,840
 and division and hate, there's too many Christians.

781
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,800
 You got the same jersey as the world around you.

782
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,620
 You don't stand out.

783
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,400
 Nobody can tell.

784
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,260
 You're just right in line.

785
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,360
 You look like everybody else.

786
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,980
 When Jesus says, no, no, no,

787
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,140
 I'm introducing something new,

788
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,380
 my people will be marked by love in the face of hate,

789
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,220
 in the face of anger, of compassion.

790
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,460
 Finally, he says this,

791
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,240
 "I tell you, love your enemies

792
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,540
 "and pray for those who persecute you

793
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,440
 "that you may be children of your Father in heaven.

794
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,020
 "He causes the sun to rise on evil and the good,

795
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,960
 "and he sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

796
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,120
 "If you love only those who love you,

797
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,260
 "what reward will you get?

798
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,780
 "Are not even tax collectors doing that?

799
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,620
 "And if you only greet your own people,

800
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,180
 "what are you doing more than others?

801
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,320
 "Do not even pagans do that."

802
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,720
 He brings up an interesting topic where he says,

803
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,220
 hey, I want you to love and pray for those who hurt you

804
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,480
 that you may be children of your Father in heaven.

805
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,060
 In other words, I want you to do this

806
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,820
 to reflect who your Father in heaven is

807
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,020
 because that's what your Father in heaven does.

808
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,980
 That's how he treats those who hate him, harm him,

809
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,860
 his enemies, if you will.

810
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,640
 Third idea from the text is that a Christian responds

811
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,920
 the way Christ responded to them.

812
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,920
 A Christian response to hurt is forgiveness,

813
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,940
 to those who hate them or harm them is love,

814
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,340
 and a Christian ultimately responds

815
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,680
 the way Christ responded to them.

816
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,300
 He brings up the idea of when you do that,

817
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,460
 you look like your Father in heaven.

818
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,140
 I can see the family resemblance.

819
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,860
 When someone hates you, whether it's online,

820
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,180
 whether it's in person, whether it's behind your back,

821
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,980
 and you respond in love, it's both supernatural

822
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,340
 and it shows your family resemblance

823
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,580
 to your Father in heaven.

824
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,980
 My kids, both times that they were in the womb,

825
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
 you walk through the same thing.

826
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,980
 I had a girl on my staff that just transitioned today

827
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,260
 who's going to be a mom.

828
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,860
 Whenever you're pregnant and going through all those stages,

829
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,540
 both you and you get these sonograms

830
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,480
 and you kind of look at the picture

831
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,940
 and it's like, man, this little tiny alien or something,

832
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,620
 and you're wondering, what are they gonna look like?

833
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,100
 What color hair are they gonna have?

834
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,940
 What facial features are they gonna have?

835
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,940
 Is it a boy, is it a girl?

836
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,020
 What color eyes are they gonna have?

837
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,020
 You're just kind of wondering

838
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,660
 and you're kind of putting it together.

839
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,860
 While you don't entirely know,

840
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,140
 you kind of have a ballpark of,

841
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,260
 man, they're gonna look something like this.

842
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,540
 In other words, they're not gonna come out

843
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,500
 like a cheetah or dotted.

844
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,940
 And if they're my child,

845
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,300
 they're gonna come out extra Caucasian and pasty.

846
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,500
 And if they're your wife, depending on,

847
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,380
 you just kind of know like, oh,

848
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,300
 this is kind of be what they're gonna look like together

849
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,980
 because they're our children

850
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,740
 and they resemble their parents.

851
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,920
 And the Bible says that those who are children of God

852
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,520
 resemble their Father in heaven.

853
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,520
 That it's just gonna happen.

854
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,700
 It's not a prerequisite to being a children of God.

855
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,840
 It's what children of God do

856
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,200
 because it's impossible for me and my wife

857
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,020
 to have a baby that has no resemblance to us at all.

858
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,620
 In the same way, you will not be a child of God,

859
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,420
 you are not, if you have no resemblance

860
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,660
 to your Father in heaven.

861
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,900
 And one of the ways that you and I resemble Him,

862
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,840
 according to Jesus, is that in the face of hate, you love.

863
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,300
 In the face of harm, you forgive.

864
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,920
 That you look people who mistreat you in the eyes

865
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,120
 and like Jesus on the cross, you love them.

866
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,960
 What do I mean on the cross?

867
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,400
 On the moments He was being killed.

868
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
 In Luke chapter 24, we're told that Jesus

869
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,720
 is having His nails, or having nails

870
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,760
 driven through His hands and His feet.

871
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,720
 And as it's taking place, He looks these men in the eyes

872
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,780
 and He says, "Father, forgive them.

873
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,120
 "They do not know what they do."

874
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,080
 In the face of the worst mistreatment and injustice

875
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,040
 and horrific act ever, He looks them in the eyes.

876
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,820
 He prays to God, "Father, will you forgive them?"

877
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:31,640
 And Christians, and it is not easy, maybe simple,

878
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,640
 but it is only by God's power can you and I

879
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,080
 extend forgiveness in the face of incredible harm.

880
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,960
 And Jesus says, "When you do, you look like your Father

881
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
 "in heaven."

882
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,520
 That's the family resemblance coming through.

883
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,040
 I know in a room like this,

884
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,020
 there is a lot of hurt represented.

885
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,560
 And the application for some of you may be,

886
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,800
 man, you need to get aside by yourself, in your car,

887
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,520
 tomorrow when you wake up, and you need to walk through

888
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,840
 and evaluate, who do I need to forgive?

889
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
 Like maybe there's groups of people.

890
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,480
 I like hold something against.

891
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,080
 Some of you, you do.

892
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,480
 Maybe there's somebody in your life

893
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,560
 that you're trying to just push out

894
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,880
 and you don't want anything to do with.

895
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,680
 Maybe they're from your past

896
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,760
 and they're not around anymore,

897
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,320
 so it's kind of out of sight, out of mind.

898
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,360
 But if you were honest, you hold something against them.

899
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,220
 Maybe it was a dating relationship,

900
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,480
 but they took something from you.

901
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,480
 And you at a deep level have hate, anger.

902
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,900
 Maybe it's justified in terms of like,

903
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,680
 man, what was done was not right.

904
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,440
 But you holding onto that anger is only gonna hurt you

905
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,520
 and you need to make the decision,

906
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,000
 man, I'm gonna forgive that person.

907
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,200
 All of us have the responsibility

908
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,320
 to ongoing, continually forgive.

909
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,880
 Jesus said in Matthew chapter 18,

910
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,080
 Peter said, "How many times do I forgive God?"

911
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,820
 He said, "Over and over and over, like God forgave you."

912
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,680
 I have had to walk through this

913
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,080
 in so many different relationships in my life.

914
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,080
 And one of the more meaningful or painful

915
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,880
 was with my own father.

916
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,520
 And worked through and forgave.

917
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,280
 And my parents split when I was young

918
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,100
 and he just wasn't around and present.

919
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,940
 And every now and then,

920
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,120
 I'll have feelings that will pop up

921
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,880
 and I'll be just like, man, that hurt or that hurts.

922
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,760
 A month ago, it was a meeting that we do every week

923
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,640
 at Watermark called Staff Prayer.

924
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,360
 Couple hundred of our staff come in for the whole church

925
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,920
 and we just prayed and share things.

926
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,800
 And at that meeting, we're in this big circle.

927
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,760
 The guy who was leading the meeting said,

928
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,640
 "Hey, we just had Father's Day.

929
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,900
 "Why don't you turn to those who are around you

930
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,840
 "and share some of your favorite memories with your dad?"

931
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,460
 So everybody turned, kind of immediately,

932
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,160
 whoever's sitting next to you.

933
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,160
 And I sat in this small circle and they shared.

934
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,020
 And I sat there and I said,

935
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,760
 "I don't have a memory

936
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,300
 "of one that is a pleasant memory.

937
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,280
 "I don't have one that comes to mind."

938
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,100
 And I was fine, it was okay.

939
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,620
 But if I don't take that to the Lord and say,

940
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,680
 and I'm choosing to forgive him,

941
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,800
 that you took from me a dad who was around,

942
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,120
 I don't have that, you took it.

943
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,660
 And I can either hold onto that

944
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:40,040
 and say, you took from me a memory, a happy memory.

945
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,760
 Got tons in this circle, I don't have a one.

946
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,640
 And I can either go, and I am holding that against you

947
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,000
 and I resent you and I am angry.

948
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Or I can say, God, I'm choosing to release that to you.

949
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,520
 You don't owe me anymore.

950
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,880
 He doesn't owe me and I forgive you.

951
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,480
 And anytime those emotions come back up,

952
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,760
 I say, man, I forgive you.

953
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,600
 Because Jesus said, the response for Christians

954
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,280
 is to be and respond like Christ responded to them,

955
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,640
 which is forgiveness and love and mercy.

956
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,800
 And when they do, I'm laying on the plane,

957
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,760
 they look like their father in heaven.

958
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,160
 They look like Jesus.

959
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,640
 There's a moment in the New Testament

960
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,120
 that's such a powerful picture of this.

961
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,120
 It's in Acts chapter seven

962
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,120
 and it's the very first martyr in Christianity.

963
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,760
 It's a guy named Stephen.

964
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
 Stephen was a deacon.

965
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,320
 A deacon was one of those guys in the early church,

966
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,080
 he was a leader, he cared for the widows.

967
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,200
 It's his job, care for the widows in the church.

968
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,360
 People who lost their husband, he'd provide food for them,

969
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,800
 he's bringing stuff over to the house, he's caring for them.

970
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,800
 And he is arrested for following Jesus.

971
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,960
 And they bring him before this court

972
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,920
 and they're like, we've heard that you follow Jesus.

973
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,040
 And they begin to basically

974
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,880
 throw all kinds of accusations at him.

975
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,360
 And he says, yes, Jesus is God.

976
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,800
 And they call him a blasphemer.

977
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,960
 And he's the savior of the world

978
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,640
 and he died for you and he died for everyone.

979
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,080
 And they call him a blasphemer.

980
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,040
 Says they rip their clothes

981
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,560
 and they drag him outside of the city walls,

982
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,220
 this group of religious men.

983
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,960
 And they call on him to denounce Christ

984
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,000
 and he refuses to.

985
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,060
 And they pick up rocks and they begin to stone him.

986
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,480
 And it says this,

987
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,420
 as they stoned him, Acts chapter seven, verse 60,

988
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:47,180
 then he fell on his knees and he cried out,

989
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:53,220
 "Lord, do not hold this sin against them."

990
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,500
 As rock after rock pelted his head

991
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,940
 until he breathed his last breath.

992
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,220
 And in the midst of that narrative,

993
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,780
 something incredibly powerful happens.

994
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,160
 The only time in the whole scripture that this happens.

995
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,020
 Stephen says, as rocks are flying towards him,

996
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,100
 he says, he looks up at the sky and he says,

997
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,420
 "I see heaven opened up

998
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,420
 "and the son of man standing at the right hand of God."

999
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,780
 Standing at the right hand of God.

1000
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,660
 You know, every other place in the Bible,

1001
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,380
 Jesus is told to be standing at the right hand of God.

1002
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,700
 Every one of them has the same thing.

1003
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,340
 He's seated.

1004
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,240
 He's seated at the right hand of God.

1005
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,780
 With one exception, in the stoning of Stephen.

1006
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,580
 And Stephen, as he's breathing his last breaths,

1007
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,420
 he says, "I see the son of God."

1008
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,500
 And he's standing.

1009
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,380
 And scholars have long pointed out,

1010
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,980
 it's as though Jesus, in a moment, rises to his feet,

1011
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,140
 giving a standing ovation

1012
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,660
 for in the face of hatred and love and anger.

1013
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,260
 Father, forgive them.

1014
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,900
 They know not what they're doing.

1015
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:01,740
 You and I have been called, if you're a follower of Jesus,

1016
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,700
 in other words, you've trusted in Jesus

1017
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,740
 and his death and resurrection on the cross,

1018
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,760
 paid for all of your sin,

1019
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,300
 everything messed up you've ever done,

1020
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,260
 and you're forgiven.

1021
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,620
 And he rose from the dead, the payment cleared.

1022
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,460
 And because you believe that,

1023
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,740
 you're gonna live forever with him.

1024
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,380
 You and I have been called, and Jesus says,

1025
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,660
 "You are not given the option,

1026
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,040
 "in the face of hurt, to not forgive.

1027
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,540
 "I am calling you to forgive.

1028
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,260
 "In the face of hate, you are called to love."

1029
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:31,300
 And you can sit there and you can justify it,

1030
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,240
 write it off, and write me off,

1031
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,560
 but you're not writing me off, you're writing him off.

1032
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,540
 That's what he said.

1033
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,180
 Let me pray.

1034
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:48,820
 Father, I pray for anyone in this room

1035
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,740
 who has hurt,

1036
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:59,860
 was so terrible and messed up

1037
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,780
 that you came to die for the person who caused that hurt,

1038
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:12,140
 that you would allow your spirit and grace

1039
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,500
 to bring forgiveness about.

1040
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:19,080
 I pray for just us as the body of Christ.

1041
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:24,020
 Would you help us to be those who look like you

1042
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:29,400
 in the face of anger, hatred,

1043
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,540
 attacks?

1044
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,200
 Would you give us the strength

1045
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,100
 to respond like Jesus did, would?

1046
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,000
 Would you unify your church,

1047
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,880
 your bride, who you bought and you ransomed

1048
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,980
 from every tribe and every tongue and every nation,

1049
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,240
 and that forever and ever and ever

1050
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,720
 we'll be a family together.

00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,980
 Would the voices of the word of God,

1052
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,060
 the voice of the word of God,

1053
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:59,700
 be louder in our lives and our hearts and our minds

1054
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,940
 than the world around us?

1055
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:05,660
 And that we would love even our enemies.

1056
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,160
 In Christ's name, amen.
