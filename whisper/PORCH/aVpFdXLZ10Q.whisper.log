[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:40.720]   What's going on, guys?
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.200]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.320]   How are we doing?
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.840]   I love it.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.120]   I love it.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.480]   Hey, Dallas, good to be with you.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.200]   Fort Worth, tuning in.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.480]   Good to be with you guys.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.560]   People in Houston, there's a gathering starting in Houston.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.640]   Folks, tuning in from all over the world,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.480]   we're so glad that you can be with us as we
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.040]   open God's word tonight and learn something.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.400]   His spirit makes known to us the things of Him.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.920]   And so I don't know when you became a Christian.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.240]   I know there's probably hundreds of you here tonight that
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.320]   have yet to become a Christian.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.000]   But when I had trusted in Christ after having been in church
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.720]   my entire life, when I was from a small town,
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.600]   and so when I moved to Dallas, I learned
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.080]   that I like shiny things, OK?
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.160]   Nice things.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.360]   And so what this looked like in my life, I loved nice cars,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.640]   and I loved--
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.360]   my other strong affection is kind of a silly one,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.920]   but I really liked nice watches or timepieces, if you will.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.160]   And so I was in the business world in corporate America,
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.880]   and my watch--
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.240]   my boss, rather, had this amazing watch.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.200]   And so I would always look at it with just covetous eyes.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.640]   I wanted that watch.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.920]   And so I liked watches, but this one particular watch
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.880]   held my deep, deep affections.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.160]   I'll show you this picture.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.120]   It's a Breitling Bentley.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.680]   And so it's made for Bentley Motors.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.640]   And so the best of both worlds, right?
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.800]   Timepieces and cars combined, a very nice watch,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.400]   a very nice car combined into one beautiful piece of jewelry
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.520]   that tells time.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.560]   And so I wanted that watch badly.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.600]   It's about $10,000, OK?
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   So this is before ministry, by the way.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.120]   Yeah, it cost-- well, some of you.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.360]   That hit home.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.160]   You're like, wow.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   Yeah, so $10,000, and I wanted it.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.040]   And my love language is gifts.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.720]   And so we're going to take up an offering.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.520]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.960]   And so my best friend at the time--
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.720]   he's still my best friend-- goes on vacation.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.560]   And he comes back.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.280]   And so because my love language is gifts--
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.680]   I had showered him on birthdays and those sorts of things.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.360]   It definitely was not his love language.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.960]   It was not reciprocated well.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.560]   And so he comes back from this vacation.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.200]   And he says, hey, man, I got you something.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.280]   And he kind of makes this formal to-do about it,
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.320]   you know, sits me down.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.720]   And I'm like, finally, you know, finally.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.640]   And I'm sitting there.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.680]   And he goes, yeah, you know, I know I've heard you say just
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.120]   some things that you like.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.720]   And so he hands me this.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.600]   And I take it, and I open it up.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.400]   And he hooked a brother up, man.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.680]   And I'm sitting there, and I'm like, I can't.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.960]   Like, I can't-- what?
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.760]   And he says, yeah.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.120]   He says, man, you've been a good buddy to me, good friend.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.960]   You've been generous to me.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.640]   And so I just want to give this to you.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.640]   I know you love it.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.040]   I know you love it.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.560]   I thought about you when I saw it, and I got it for you.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.600]   And I'm like, I don't know even if I can do that.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.160]   I was a Christian at the time, a fairly new Christian.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.120]   And I don't even know if that's like good stewardship.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.200]   I don't think I can-- you know, I've
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.960]   got to give that to the poor or something.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.360]   And so some homeless man in Dallas
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.320]   would be walking around with a Bentley, a Breitling.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.640]   And he goes, he's just like, it's yours.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.160]   And I'm like, but bro, I can't believe
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.280]   you spent that much on me.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.160]   He's like, what are you talking about?
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.760]   He's like, I know what that watch costs.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   He's like, it's $50 in Chinatown.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:19.000]   He was like, oh, you thought it was real?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.200]   He's like, no, it's a replica, counterfeit, fake.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   Now, I don't know if you saw it, but it's made--
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.920]   I mean, this is masterfully made to the exact weight.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.440]   All of the exact markings, the exact emblems,
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.200]   everything on the outside looks exactly like the real thing.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.120]   You can't even tell that it's not the real thing
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.440]   until you open it up and you look inside.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.760]   But it's fake.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.400]   That's what being fake means, is everything on the outside
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.800]   looks like it's legit.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.920]   It looks like it's the real thing.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.440]   But the inside is not the same.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.160]   The inside's not Swiss parts, not 21 jewel movements.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.040]   The inside's not Breitling made for Bentley.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.200]   No, the inside's cheap metal, cheap gears,
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.360]   pieces that will break down, pieces that won't last.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   And it's counterfeit.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.520]   And so in the same way some of us have been in church
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.240]   and we say, hey, I have a faith.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.640]   I know God.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.880]   And we've learned this language.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.000]   And we've learned some Bible verses.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And we've learned to study the Bible.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   We've learned to take pictures and to share.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.400]   What we're learning, and we've learned how to talk smart
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.240]   in circles so that others think that we're following God.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.640]   But when we get all by ourselves,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.840]   there's no relationship with God.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.600]   Doesn't that define our faith, like who we are
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.400]   when we're by ourselves with God?
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.600]   Like when we're talking with him
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.720]   and there's actual relationship there.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.440]   All that other stuff's done for men.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.560]   That's fake Christianity.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.360]   That's fake faith.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.280]   So tonight I wanna talk about with you
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.920]   how to spot fake faith from counterfeit Christians.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.200]   Because if you look at this, it's very, very difficult
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.080]   to tell that it's fake.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.560]   You'd have to be trained in how to know that it's fake.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.240]   How do you spot fake faith from counterfeit Christians?
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.560]   Now some of you, you're here and you're like,
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.360]   no, no, man, okay, well, the message is lost on me.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.960]   I'm the real deal, I'm a Christian.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.000]   I trusted in Christ.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.960]   It was really, I believed in him in my heart.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.360]   I confessed with my mouth, believed in my heart.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.840]   And you know, I'd say, but even you,
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.920]   there's elements of your faith, I promise,
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.240]   that as we examine the scriptures
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.720]   of what Jesus is gonna tell us tonight in Matthew 6,
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.080]   there are parts of our faith
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.400]   that have drifted towards being fake,
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.480]   that have been for the approval of man.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.720]   We've done to impress people,
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.160]   things we do to impress people.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.840]   That's the only reason anyone has anything that's fake.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.440]   Why does someone buy a fake Breitling?
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.400]   Why does someone buy a fake Tory Burch?
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.360]   Why does someone buy something that's fake?
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.880]   It's to impress people,
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.800]   to look like they have the real thing when they don't.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.200]   And why does someone have a fake faith?
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.440]   To impress Christians, to impress people.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.560]   And so we're in Summer on the Mount,
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.680]   which is just a series we're doing
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.280]   on the most famous sermon of all time,
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.280]   Jesus's Sermon on the Mount.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.920]   If you went home and read it, I said this,
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.440]   it would take you about 15 minutes
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.840]   to read through the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.160]   But in that 15 minutes, Jesus covers law,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   missions, adultery, lust, love, hate, judgment,
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.960]   marriage, divorce, enemies, the poor, prayer,
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.760]   anxiety, money, materialism, heaven and hell
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.480]   in 15 minutes if you read it.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.440]   And so we're taking it,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.160]   we're chopping it up in these little excerpts.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.640]   We're gonna be in chapter six, verses one through 18,
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.920]   if you want to turn there.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.960]   Last week, David talked about loving your enemies.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.440]   And consistently in Jesus's Sermon on the Mount,
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.120]   he goes after the hearts of men.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.160]   He goes after the inside.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.960]   Because the religious people of this time
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.580]   did so much for the appearance of holiness.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.200]   They did so much to appear holy.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.360]   And can I just tell you something
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.440]   that kind of concerns me up front?
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.000]   Is I don't know that they knew they were fake.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.060]   Like when somebody is a con
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.320]   and they live in that con for so long,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.400]   I don't know that they actually know
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.640]   that they're conning people.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.440]   Like I watched a movie just this weekend with my wife,
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.760]   Big Eyes, I don't know if you've seen it,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.360]   it's about this guy who pretends to be an artist.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.480]   And he lives in that for so long
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.220]   that he actually thinks he's an artist when he's not.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.960]   And some of us, we've lived in Christianity for so long
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.760]   that we believe we're Christian,
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.840]   but when we get in our car by ourselves
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.520]   and no one else is looking, there's no relationship.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.720]   And so the men of Jesus's day
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.740]   did so much to appear spiritual.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.040]   Do we still do this?
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.520]   What's the number one reason people don't trust Christ?
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.040]   People aren't Christians.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.840]   What's the biggest reason?
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.800]   Is it because they look at Jesus,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.840]   they're like, "I didn't really like his teaching,
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.460]   "all this stuff about love your enemies,
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.300]   "that's just not my thing."
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.220]   I mean, is that what it is, they reject Jesus?
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.460]   They reject Jesus's teaching?
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.200]   Why do people reject Christianity?
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.300]   Because Christians are hypocrites.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.800]   That's the number one reason I hear.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.920]   You go to church, Christians are a bunch of hypocrites.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.080]   They say one thing, they do another.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.500]   They say, "Hey, this is how you should live,"
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.580]   but then they live however they want.
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.940]   They say, "Hey, the Bible is true,"
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.440]   but then they don't actually abide by it.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.360]   They don't even read it.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.840]   Christians are hypocrites.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.720]   And so tonight, Jesus is going hard after hypocrites.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.520]   Let's go.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.340]   Verse one, "Be careful not to practice your righteousness
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.960]   "in front of others to be seen by them.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.920]   "If you do, you will have no reward
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.040]   "from your Father in heaven."
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.080]   It's the summary of this entire message
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.200]   right there in verse one.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.400]   Let me read it to you again, lean in.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.500]   "Be careful not to practice your righteousness
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.740]   "in front of others to be seen by them.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.000]   "If you do, you will have no reward
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.400]   "from your Father in heaven."
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:13.080]   So when you give, he's gonna give us three examples tonight,
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.140]   giving, praying, and fasting.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.620]   We're gonna look at how fake faith gives,
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.400]   how fake faith prays, and how fake faith fasts.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.440]   And he starts with the giving.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.880]   "So when you give to the needy,
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.480]   "do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.480]   "in the synagogues and on the streets
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.080]   "to be honored by others.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.440]   "Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.820]   "But when you give to the needy,
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.300]   "do not let your left hand know
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.100]   "what your right hand is doing
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.480]   "so that your giving may be in secret.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.960]   "Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret,"
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.920]   'cause he's God and he knows all things,
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.420]   "then he will reward you.
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.800]   "Do not give or be generous to impress men."
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.000]   Anybody ever been in a church where they pass the plate?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.960]   You ever done that?
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.160]   Like, where does your mind go when they do that?
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.800]   I grew up in a church that passes the offering plate.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.480]   Actually, I grew up in one where they come by
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.800]   with the baskets, which is even worse
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.120]   'cause he's standing right there, you know,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.720]   he has the basket.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.360]   And my mind always, like, I think it's human nature,
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.800]   I'm thinking, man, who's watching me right now, okay?
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.640]   It's all I got, dude, a dollar, what are you talking,
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.000]   you know, who's eyes on me?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.640]   Now, can you imagine if we pass the plate,
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.300]   if you're a guest with us tonight, we don't do that.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.560]   We don't take up an offering here.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.040]   We believe that the Lord loves a cheerful giver,
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.960]   as the scriptures say, and so you can give in the back.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.360]   We don't pass a plate here.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.200]   But if you've ever been in that environment
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.480]   and you're sitting there, you can imagine,
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   like, if I'm out there and there's a plate passing
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.920]   and I'm watching you kind of, you know,
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.600]   dig in your pockets and I'm like, hurry up.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.280]   And so I go in my wallet, right,
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.000]   and I'm going to see what kind of money I have
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.960]   and I realize I don't have the dollar bill
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.400]   that I usually give in the offering.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.360]   All I have is the 10, the 20, and 100,
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.160]   and I'm like, oh, I guess I don't give tonight,
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.800]   'cause all I, and then I'm like, you know what?
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.780]   I'm going for it.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.920]   I'm gonna be extra generous this evening.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.840]   I'm gonna give this $10 bill.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.520]   That's gonna happen, and so I see it coming to me
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.520]   and I'm just like, okay, you know, stop taking your time,
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.840]   let's get to me, and it gets me.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.760]   The plate's right there, and I stand up.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.400]   I stand up and I just grab this guy here.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.240]   And I just.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.820]   (horn blaring)
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:34.640]   Attention, please.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.340]   May I have your attention, please?
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.680]   I love the way the Lord is moving in this establishment.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.560]   And I see that you guys are asking for an offering,
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.840]   and I would like to generously give of myself
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.320]   the money that I saved on trumpet lessons.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.640]   I would like to donate this here $10 bill
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.160]   for the cause of ministry in this establishment.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.580]   You're welcome.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.960]   Thank you, you're welcome.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.600]   That's right, and feel free to name the building after me.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.560]   Jesus, I love this.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.720]   I love what he's doing here
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.760]   'cause this, Jesus is showing you his personality.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.800]   He's using satire.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.880]   He's using sarcasm.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.120]   He says, hey, don't give like those who have the trumpets
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.680]   and they give to be noticed by men.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.440]   I'm telling you, they've received their reward in full.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:36.600]   Like, there's no history of people actually announcing
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.640]   what they give with trumpets.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.820]   He's being funny.
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.720]   I love that.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.600]   And so there's like a contradiction.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.520]   Another reason people don't like the scriptures
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.000]   is they say, well, the Bible contradicts itself
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.980]   because in Matthew 5:16, it says in the same sermon,
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.680]   it says, in the same way, let your light shine before others
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.540]   that they may see your good deeds
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.880]   and glorify your Father in heaven.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.740]   Is that a contradiction?
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.880]   Let your light shine before others?
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.600]   No, because you let your light shine before others
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.740]   for God's glory, but if you do it for your glory,
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.000]   it's disqualifying.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.640]   You've received your reward in full.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.540]   Now, if you give for God's glory
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.720]   or you do good deeds for God's glory
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.280]   or you're living to, for him alone, awesome.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.600]   If you do it to impress anybody whose eyes are on you,
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.820]   it doesn't count.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.120]   God doesn't receive it.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.440]   So my first point this evening
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.360]   is fake faith gives to get noticed.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.640]   Fake faith gives to get noticed.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.260]   Giving lots for the wrong reasons
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.880]   is not giving, it's getting.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.760]   If you give for the wrong reasons,
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.320]   you give to get noticed.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.780]   That's not giving, that's getting.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.700]   That's gaining something.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.660]   You're not being generous.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.460]   You're exchanging what you have for attention.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.160]   That is not being generous.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.780]   First Corinthians 13, verse three says,
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.580]   "If I give all I have to the poor
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.120]   "and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.020]   "but do not have love, I gain nothing.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.500]   "If I give everything for the wrong reasons,
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.040]   "I gain nothing."
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.900]   And so why you give matters more than what you give.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.820]   Jesus is going out of his way to say
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.540]   if you give to impress people,
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.040]   there is no reward in that.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:26.500]   Likewise, if you give because you are afraid
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.740]   of what it will look like if you don't give,
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.080]   you're giving out of the fear of man.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.980]   And he says there's no reward in that.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.700]   The church I grew up in, they had this,
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.820]   I don't know if you guys have ever seen this,
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.820]   it's like these baskets on a stick.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.860]   And so when they would call for the offering,
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.220]   the offering men would come down the aisle
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.840]   and they'd gather, not offering men,
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.780]   I don't know what they were called,
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.020]   but there were these men that would take your money
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.460]   and they would come up here
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.020]   and then they'd spread out throughout the church
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.460]   and they'd walk down the aisles
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.540]   and they'd have this basket like this.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.940]   And so before church this one day,
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.980]   one of the guys who was one of the offering men
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.140]   kind of got into this argument with another guy
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.060]   who was just attending church that morning.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.340]   And so they kind of got into an argument
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.740]   and the guy that was just attending
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.380]   said something to him that wasn't very nice.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.020]   And so when they go to the offering,
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.020]   he takes this basket and he gets to that guy
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.420]   who was like in the third row
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.560]   and he just puts this basket in front of him
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.760]   and he just sits there.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.020]   And the whole church is watching,
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.020]   and it's not a big church,
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.540]   but the whole church is watching
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.500]   and he just sits there and the guy's like.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.460]   And he just starts shaking it a little bit.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.780]   And he just, he looks at the basket and he goes.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.900]   And the guy, I've never seen him,
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.380]   he just turned bright red,
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.420]   like blood just rushed to his head.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.180]   He sat there and he eventually goes for his wallet
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.020]   and he pulled something out and he gave,
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.920]   but he did so for the approval of man.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.500]   And in the same way, I think so many of us do that.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.540]   Like whenever we do anything benevolent or philanthropic,
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.860]   we do so because we know people are watching us
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.020]   or we celebrate it via social media or whatever.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.920]   Look at me.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.220]   That's right, blowing my trumpet.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.540]   Yes, I am that guy.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.900]   Yes, I did.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.820]   Yes.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.020]   And he says, there's no reward for you.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.600]   You've received it in full.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.340]   Second Corinthians chapter nine, verse seven says,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.580]   each of you should give what you have decided
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.980]   in your hearts to give,
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.740]   not reluctantly or under compulsion,
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.380]   for God loves a cheerful giver.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.700]   That's why we don't pass a plate here.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.700]   I don't want you to be motivated by the person
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.620]   sitting next to you with their eyes on you.
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.260]   That's not a good reason to give.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.540]   And so this is not saying
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.740]   that you can't have accountability around giving,
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.220]   it's saying don't give to impress people.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.300]   And so what's that heart check?
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.060]   Have you ever guys helped somebody
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.540]   go on an international discipleship trip
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.420]   or you might call them a mission trip?
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.900]   And when you give online,
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.500]   there's always this box that you can check
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.140]   that says anonymous, but who wants to do that?
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.420]   I mean, if I give anonymously,
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.220]   I mean, they won't know that I gave to them.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.460]   I mean, they won't say thank you or anything.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.760]   Like that's not, how does that count if I give anonymously?
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.140]   You want a heart check?
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.260]   Give when no one's looking
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260]   and give more than you're comfortable with.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.980]   That will help you.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.280]   That will help your heart.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.480]   But it's not saying that you can't have accountability
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.940]   around this.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.460]   It's saying the reason that you share
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.060]   should not be to impress people.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.600]   I live in community,
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.320]   which means I just have this small group of guys
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.360]   we meet with weekly, couples actually.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.000]   And they know all of my finances.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I do not spend $100 without running it by those guys.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.440]   If I'm gonna make a significant purchase,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.600]   I run it by those men first
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.980]   just so they can help me check my heart
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.800]   so I'm not buying $10,000 watches.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.980]   And we're going through our finances
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.060]   on this one particular year.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.660]   And I'm talking to this, to my buddy,
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.960]   and I just see that $25,000 comes out of his account.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.480]   Now to paint the picture,
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.000]   this guy makes much less than most of you.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   So he's just a normal guy, has a normal job.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.080]   He's not a baller or anything.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.920]   I mean, he's just like one of you guys.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.580]   And I see this 25 grand come out of his account,
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.560]   and I'm like, "Hey, what is that?"
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.800]   And he's like, "Well, I don't know if I should tell you."
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.920]   And he references this.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.520]   And I'm like, "No, I mean, tell us
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.220]   so we can celebrate appropriately."
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.740]   And he's like, "Well, we gave that."
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.560]   He's like, "We saved that to give."
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.040]   And I just said, "When?
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.280]   You know, when did you do that?"
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.120]   And he goes, "Well, I drove to the church
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.640]   all by myself.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.280]   I walked down that quiet hallway."
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   And he said, "It's deafening,
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.300]   the sound that a check makes
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.400]   when it hits the bottom of the offering,
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.440]   and no one's there to hear it,
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.280]   no one's there to see it.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.440]   It's just you and God."
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.520]   He said, "We saved that to give."
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.360]   And you know what?
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.200]   I wasn't impressed by that.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.320]   I was influenced by that.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.560]   So we don't share to impress.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.520]   We share to influence in the context of community.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.360]   That's fine.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.720]   But we don't share to impress people.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.960]   We don't give to get noticed,
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.320]   or we don't give to impress.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.600]   We give because we believe everything we have is God's.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.800]   We have it on loan for his purposes.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.880]   God, what I have is yours.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.080]   It's not my money, it's yours.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.440]   That savings account is yours.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.240]   All that I have is yours.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.240]   The cattle on a thousand hills are yours.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.760]   And so verse five,
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.600]   "And when you pray,"
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.520]   he's going prayer now,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.440]   "do not be like the hypocrites,
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.320]   for they love to pray standing in the synagogues
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.720]   and on the street corners to be seen by others.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.040]   Truly I tell you,
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.840]   they have received their reward in full.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.440]   But when you pray, go into your room,
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.640]   close the door and pray to your father who is unseen.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.720]   Then your father, who sees what is done in secret,
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.400]   will reward you.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.240]   And when you pray,
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.080]   do not keep on babbling like the pagans,
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.160]   for they think they will be heard
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.640]   because of their many words.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.480]   Do not be like them,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.400]   for your father knows what you need before you ask him."
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.440]   It's just interesting that Jesus is giving this sermon.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.920]   He's like, "Hey, this is what's really important."
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.480]   And I don't know that we still heed these words today.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.040]   He's like, "Hey, I want you to listen to me, guys.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.600]   I only have so many words that I can give
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.920]   in the most famous sermon of all time.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.840]   It's gonna be reserved for thousands of years
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.360]   so that people can read it and learn from it.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.120]   And this is what I want you to know.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.520]   Don't pray like the pagans
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.920]   who try to impress people with their many words."
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:24.800]   "This then is how you should pray.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.600]   Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.160]   Your kingdom come, your will be done
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.760]   on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.200]   Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our debts
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.200]   as we have forgiven our debtors.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.720]   And lead us not into temptation,
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.480]   but deliver us from the evil one."
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.320]   And then he goes on, further heart surgery.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.240]   "For if you forgive other people when they sin against you,
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   your heavenly father will also forgive you.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.720]   But if you do not forgive others their sins,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.160]   your father will not forgive your sins."
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.520]   Do you know what Jesus is doing here?
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.760]   Jesus is intentionally praying an unimpressive prayer.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.120]   It's a very similar prayer to Luke 11
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.360]   when he grabs his disciples and he says,
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   "Hey, let me show you how to pray."
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.360]   Listen, not what to pray, but how to pray,
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.200]   which is different than what to pray.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.360]   And he says, "Don't go on babbling the same things
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.600]   over and over like the pagans."
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.440]   What is that?
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.480]   And then what do we do?
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.000]   We take it, "Our father who art in heaven,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.840]   hallowed be thy name.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.000]   Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.840]   as it is in heaven.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.880]   Give us this day our daily bread.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.840]   Hail Mary, full of grace.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.680]   The Lord is with thee.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.840]   Holy Spirit, glory be to the Father and to the Son
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.680]   and the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning,
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.000]   is now and ever.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.040]   Angel of God, my guardian dear,
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.200]   to whom God's love and trust be here.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.280]   Blessed is the Lord in these, I guess,
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.120]   which are about to receive,
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.160]   that I bow down to Christ, Lord, amen.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.120]   Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.880]   and let this food to us be blessed."
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.680]   God is great, God is good.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.520]   What do we do?
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.320]   We babble these things and our hearts detest from our words.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.480]   We're not thinking about what we're saying.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.600]   Maybe you are.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.440]   I didn't.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.400]   Maybe you do.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.200]   Maybe you say that, "Our father,"
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.680]   'cause you're my father.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.600]   You're in heaven, I'm not in heaven.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.440]   And maybe your heart's attached to the words, "Awesome."
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.240]   I'm not talking to you.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.560]   But I think most of us, we go through this routine,
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.080]   the very thing Jesus is telling us not to do,
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.920]   and we pray the what, not the how.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:18.400]   Bill Moyers was a former Baptist minister
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.760]   and special assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.160]   And the president had invited Mr. Moyers over for dinner
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.000]   with his family there in the White House.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.360]   And when he came in, President Lyndon B. Johnson said,
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.400]   "Would you say the prayer?
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.160]   Would you say grace before our meal?"
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.520]   And so when Bill Moyers began to pray before the meal,
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.280]   President Lyndon B. Johnson interrupted him and said,
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.080]   "Bill, Bill, speak up, I can't hear you."
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.080]   And he simply said, "Mr. President, I wasn't talking to you."
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.600]   And I love that because I think so often
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.120]   when we pray publicly,
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.400]   when we pray in the presence of others,
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.560]   and this is very true within the church as well,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.320]   when we pray in the presence of others,
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.560]   we pray for them, not for their benefit,
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.860]   but to impress them.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.840]   And so my second point this evening
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.640]   is fake faith performs prayers for people.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:20.200]   Fake faith performs prayers for people.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.960]   That's how you spot a fake faith,
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.480]   someone who performs prayers.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.560]   Hey, I wanna pray, I want it to be special,
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.480]   I want they to hear me.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.160]   And so if you're praying and thinking
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.700]   what others think about your prayer,
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.640]   you're not praying, you are performing.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:38.600]   And likewise, if you're afraid to pray publicly,
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.720]   then you don't understand what prayer is.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.400]   Because it has nothing to do with who else is there
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.680]   and who else is listening.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.440]   Prayer is simply conversation with God, that's all it is.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.760]   It doesn't matter who's listening,
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.640]   we're not thinking about who's listening,
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.920]   we're simply conversing with the creator of the universe.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.400]   At my school, in high school,
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.440]   we had this deal called see you at the pole.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.200]   Anybody have that?
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.040]   See you at the pole.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.160]   You remember this day,
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.720]   like you were gonna gather around
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.120]   and pray around the flagpole,
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.840]   and so you get there and you're surprised who's there,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.680]   you're like, really?
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.240]   You're like, you're a Christian?
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.920]   [congregation laughing]
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.760]   Man, I had no idea.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.840]   And they're like, people are coming up to you,
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.520]   they're like, so you're a Christian?
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.600]   Yeah, man, I had no clue.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.920]   Man, never knew that, wow.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.600]   And you're sitting there and you grab hands,
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.600]   and like the rule in my school
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.640]   is they would go around a circle in order,
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.560]   which is always a little nerve-wracking.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.200]   'Cause I mean, you see it coming like a train,
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.360]   and if you didn't wanna pray,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.960]   you simply squeeze the person's hands next to you.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.000]   That's just a pass, I pass.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.160]   Not today, you know?
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.760]   And so, you're sitting there,
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.840]   and so what I'm thinking about
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.040]   as everybody else is praying,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.640]   is I'm noticing who's passing.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.000]   I'm not a Christian at this point, but I'm a faker.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.840]   And so, I'm seeing who's passing,
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.440]   I'm like, oh, yeah, scared to pray in public, huh?
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.320]   You know, and so it's coming closer,
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.360]   and I'm like, this is my time, I'm coming out.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.000]   Like, this is gonna be big, you know?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.240]   These people are gonna know how much I love God
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.480]   by what I'm about to say.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.320]   I mean, this is gonna be amazing.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.520]   People are gonna trust in Christ,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.720]   'cause this prayer that's about to happen.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.520]   And it's coming closer, and I'm thinking,
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.240]   okay, like, how do I start this, you know?
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.680]   Okay, Father, God, Daddy, Jehovah, Jireh.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.040]   And it gets closer, and then they did a double skip on me.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.880]   So, skip, skip, and I'm just out there now.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.720]   I'm like, did she just squeeze my hand?
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.200]   It's my turn.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.200]   Two people passed, and now I'm,
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.800]   Heavenly Father, God in heaven,
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.960]   day by day, we pray by day.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   Lord, protect our country, amen, squeeze.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.920]   And I'm like, what just happened?
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.760]   I can't feel my legs.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.520]   What did I say?
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.000]   What did I, afterwards, I'm talking about,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.760]   hey, did you, so did you hear my, like, what did I say?
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.160]   Like, something about day by day,
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.560]   in the country, I don't know.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.960]   Have you ever noticed how some people pray
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.360]   so different than they talk?
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.000]   It doesn't seem like they're conversing with God.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.280]   It seems like, in those times,
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.120]   we're trying to impress someone.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.760]   Father God, Father God, Almighty Lord,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.640]   Father God, Father God, Jesus, Father.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.520]   My uncle says we're the we just church.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.080]   I said, what does that mean?
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.960]   He says, you know, you're the church that says we just,
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.480]   we just, and Lord, we just wanna ask you,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.840]   and we just, and we just.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.720]   Could you imagine, like, if my daughters
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.600]   talked to me that way?
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.200]   Like, I got two little girls, they came up,
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.120]   and they're like, Father, Daddy, we just wanna ask you.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.000]   I'd be like, just ask me.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Why are you telling me you just wanna ask me?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.360]   We just wanna ask you, if in your grace and mercy,
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.480]   you might grant us dessert this evening,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.960]   for thy mercy and thy benefit, and glory and honor.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.600]   I would just be like, what?
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.080]   You want ice cream?
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.720]   I mean, just tell, like, what are you saying right now?
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.920]   Why do we do that?
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   Can I tell you why we do that?
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.760]   We learn that.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.680]   Fake Christianity's contagious.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.440]   When it's been modeled for you,
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.360]   you take it and you run with it.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.280]   Why do we go, Father God?
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.040]   'Cause you heard Father God, that's why.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.000]   Father God, we just wanna, what?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.120]   You heard somebody say that,
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.800]   and so you repeat it over and over.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.520]   And the reason I bring that to your attention,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.800]   'cause I'm guilty as well,
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.360]   is because we wanna make sure
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.480]   our heart's connected to what we're saying.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:49.320]   And we're praying to God, not to anyone else,
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.400]   not to who is listening to us.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.280]   We're not trying to press anyone with our prayers.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.100]   We're talking to God.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.480]   Your prayers are not performances, they're conversations.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.160]   Now, granted, they're conversations with the Creator
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.300]   who could kill you as you sit there,
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.200]   but they're conversations.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.280]   And so Jesus says, pray like this.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.860]   Acknowledge he is holy.
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.620]   He says, pray like this.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.860]   He has desires and so seek to know them.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:17.760]   He knows your needs, ask that he meets those needs.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.640]   And he forgives, and so should you.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.500]   And he strengthens you in temptation,
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.080]   and so in temptation, rely on him.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.120]   Amen.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.600]   And then he continues the heart surgery,
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.680]   and he says, if you can't forgive others,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.820]   you don't understand the gospel.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.820]   To which I'd encourage you
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.160]   to listen to David's talk last week.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.540]   If you cannot forgive others,
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.440]   then you do not understand how the Father forgives you.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.000]   And so bottom line, in prayer,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.520]   don't perform to impress people.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.720]   And so in the church, I really feel that temptation.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.880]   I'm gonna end this message with a prayer,
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.000]   and all of you are gonna be listening.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.600]   There will be thousands of people listening to that prayer,
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.160]   and so sometimes I start that prayer in my head,
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.320]   and I just say, Lord, there's a real temptation right now
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.440]   to wanna be liked.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.480]   God, Galatians 1:10 says, am I now trying to win
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.840]   the approval of God or of men,
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.880]   for if I'm trying to please men,
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.960]   I'm not a bond servant of Jesus.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.120]   And God, I just care too much
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.320]   what these people think about me.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.600]   Would you heal my heart,
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.120]   and would you allow me to talk directly to you
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.160]   for our benefit and your glory, God?
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.000]   Help me.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Help me not to perform with a bunch of words babbling
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.080]   that I've learned from fake Christians
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:37.960]   or fake Christianity, fake faith.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.800]   Help me.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.160]   Start your prayer with that.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.440]   Verse 16, and when you fast,
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.960]   do not look somber as the hypocrites do,
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.320]   for they disfigure their faces
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.120]   to show others they are fasting.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.880]   Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.840]   But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.400]   so that it will not be obvious to others
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.360]   that you are fasting,
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.840]   but only to your Father who is unseen,
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.080]   and your Father who sees what is done in secret
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.840]   will reward you.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.720]   Praise God for the scriptures,
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   'cause I know that so many of you came in here this evening
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.240]   fasting and just not knowing what to do,
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.840]   you know, messing your hair all up
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   and letting everybody here know you're fasting.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.240]   I know that's been a real popular conversation this evening.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.080]   You've turned to your neighbors and said,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.840]   "Yes, I am fasting, not even Whole30."
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.200]   Nope, I'm fasting.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.800]   I'm going without, no, the problem is we don't fast.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.840]   And Jesus, God on the earth, Christ,
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:46.480]   we're Christians, little Jesuses, followers of Christ,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.240]   says when you do this, he just assumes the close.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.600]   He assumes that we do this,
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.640]   and the problem is we don't do this.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.680]   And I think it's one of the most powerful
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.720]   spiritual disciplines out there
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.920]   that we don't frankly take advantage of,
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.640]   that we don't benefit from.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.600]   And so my third and final point is fake faith sacrifices
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.440]   or goes without to appear spiritual.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   Fake faith sacrifices to appear spiritual.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.440]   And so Jesus assumes we do this.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.280]   I don't know if you knew this,
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.280]   Jesus talks more about fasting than baptism.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.880]   I mean, there's some of you here that believes
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.080]   baptism is contingent on salvation.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.920]   It's not, by the way, okay?
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.360]   But some of you here actually think that it is,
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.600]   and I'm telling you, Jesus had more to say about fasting
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.880]   than he did baptism.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.360]   He says, hey, this is really important
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.680]   that you would do this.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.080]   And we don't do it.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.040]   We don't go without.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.360]   We don't wanna be uncomfortable in that way.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.800]   It just seems weird.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.640]   And I'll tell you that if we did fast,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.320]   if we did go without, we'd wanna tell everyone.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.000]   Like I don't skip dessert without telling someone.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.400]   I'm like, do you see that willpower, man?
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.320]   No, sir, no dessert for me.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.200]   I'm like, get the trumpet, man.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.240]   That's right, not even a Whole30, just self-discipline.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.740]   Relying on the Spirit, that's what just happened.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:17.200]   Bill Bright, who founded Campus Crusades, now called Crew,
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.600]   he fasted every year of his life for 40 days,
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:27.600]   from 1994 until he passed away in 2013, I think.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.840]   2013, no, 2003.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.680]   2003.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.480]   Of malnutrition.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.080]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:44.600]   Father, forgive me.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.640]   Ah, no, he's a godly man.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.640]   A truly lot of people know Christ
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.400]   because of the work of this man.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.800]   And so he went from 1994 to 2003
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.440]   and fasted every year of his life for 40 days
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.320]   like Jesus did.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.840]   Jesus fasted as an example.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.140]   Why would Jesus fast?
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.120]   As an example to us, that we would fast.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   Showing him that, hey, he went through challenges too,
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.680]   as a human, fully human, fully God.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.660]   He was hungry.
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:13.120]   And so, Bill, so what do I mean by fasting?
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.120]   All he drank for 40 days was water and juice.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.560]   That's it.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.720]   Like, could you imagine being in a business meeting
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.680]   35 days in?
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.760]   You hadn't eaten for 35 days and not telling anybody.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.840]   I'd be like, guys, before we start this meeting,
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.200]   I just gotta tell you something.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.440]   And I need a trophy.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.480]   And dessert, you know?
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.080]   I was like, somebody needs to hear this, okay?
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.720]   I've gone 35 days without eating.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.440]   Like, there would be, it would be Instagram,
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.320]   Twitter, like Facebook, everything would be going crazy.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.320]   I'd be like, yes, I did, 35 days.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.920]   I made it, 40 days.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.560]   I'd want everyone to know, but he did it.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.400]   When he did this, it wasn't public knowledge.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.240]   He didn't tell anyone.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.880]   He wrote a book about it now, telling us how to do it.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.560]   But it wasn't something that he did to impress people,
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.040]   but to influence people.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.240]   And many have been influenced by his life.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.440]   And I love that fasting is not just a reminder
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.360]   to depend on God.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   Some of you have probably heard that
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.400]   when you have hunger pains,
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.200]   then you can be reminded to go to God.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.680]   Fasting is actually strengthening your resolve
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.120]   to overcome sin, why?
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.680]   Because it's going without what your body naturally desires.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.320]   Your body naturally desires food.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.560]   Everything inside of you naturally desires food.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.600]   And so you resist that and you strengthen your resolve
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.840]   and your ability to resist that, just like sin.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.240]   Your body naturally desires sex.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.880]   Your body naturally desires attention from men.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.560]   Your body naturally desires money or whatever that is.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.440]   And so you strengthen your resolve to resist that temptation.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.760]   That's what fasting is.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:55.000]   And so fast, fast from things like social media.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.720]   Okay, people come up to me all the time
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.160]   and ask about if something is a specific sin.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.560]   They'll say, "Hey, is it a sin to drink alcohol?"
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.640]   And I'll say, "I don't know, fast from it and ask God."
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.760]   And then they'll be like, "Why don't you like,
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.400]   "go 40 days or six months without drinking
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.320]   "and ask God if it's a sin.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.640]   "It may be a sin to you, I don't know."
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.920]   And they're like, "I don't wanna go six months
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.280]   "without drinking, well then it's probably a sin."
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.520]   I mean, the Bible says don't be enslaved by anything.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.160]   Don't be in bondage to anything.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.400]   So if people come up to me and say,
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.320]   "Well, is masturbation a sin?"
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.720]   I say, "Is it something that you participate in?"
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.720]   Yes, okay, well fast from it and ask God if it's a sin.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.400]   To be clear, show my cards on that,
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.560]   I don't think drinking is a sin,
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.720]   I think getting drunk is a sin,
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.360]   I do think masturbation is a sin.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.120]   But wherever you're at, like, and I will tell you,
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.480]   anything that you can't stop, you're in bondage to.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.560]   And so if you're wondering if something is a sin,
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.640]   fast from it.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.320]   Take six months and say, "I'm gonna go without that."
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.880]   Or 40 days, start there,
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.160]   "I'm gonna go without that thing completely."
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.920]   And ask the Lord to reveal to you, fast from food.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.720]   That's what Jesus is specifically calling us to,
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.320]   especially when making big decisions.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.840]   I'm telling you, I believe it's the most powerful
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.400]   spiritual discipline that the Lord uses.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.160]   Don't use it like superstition,
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.840]   but just say, "God, I'm gonna do this to draw near to you
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.400]   "so that I can hear your voice clearly."
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.960]   Father, would you speak into this specific decision?
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.240]   But do not fast to appear spiritual.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.320]   Do not fast to impress people.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.160]   This is just a line the Lord gave me
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.680]   as I prepared for this message, and so,
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.000]   it's this, I want you to write it down.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.480]   We are so focused on our need for affirmation,
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.680]   we've lost the practice of adoration.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.200]   We are so focused on our need for affirmation,
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.600]   we've lost the practice of adoration.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.200]   It's no fun to do something super spiritual
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.520]   if no one's gonna notice, right?
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.160]   Like what credit, I mean, what?
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.400]   I don't get any credit from people?
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.240]   That's what he's saying, he says,
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.800]   "You live for God's approval, and God's approval alone,
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.400]   "which you receive through Jesus,
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.800]   "but when you receive it, then you live as though
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.160]   "you have a relationship with the Creator,
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.560]   "that you know Him, and you talk to Him,
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.760]   "and you walk in obedience to Him."
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.640]   You talk to Him, and you walk in obedience to Him.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.800]   But some of us, we live like,
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.240]   well, if no one's gonna notice, like,
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.120]   why would I do that?
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.720]   That's no fun.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.800]   I saw this video this week,
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.280]   and it's just too relevant not to show,
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.360]   and so, you guys watch this for a minute.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.920]   Are you a Christian girl that loves
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.280]   taking photos of her devotions?
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.880]   Do you spend hours framing the perfect picture
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.860]   without the payoff of people noticing
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.280]   how spiritual you are on the internet?
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.920]   Introducing Christian Girl Instagram.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.680]   101 tips and tricks to get more likes
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.480]   on your devotional photos.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.120]   Hi, I'm John Crist with Christian Girl Instagram.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.360]   Do you struggle to get likes
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.360]   on those devotional Instagram photos?
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.480]   Hashtag the struggle is real.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.880]   From the best-selling author of shameless workout selfies
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.320]   comes Christian Girl Instagram.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.560]   I would always get totes stressed out
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.880]   trying to decide which Bible verse to show.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.920]   Not anymore.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.440]   Okay, you're always gonna wanna stay away
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.960]   from common verses like Jeremiah 29 11,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.280]   or John 3 16.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.760]   No matter what verse you choose,
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.560]   you always wanna make sure you highlight multiple verses
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.200]   with multiple colors.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.880]   Because after all, what's the point of having devotions
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.680]   if no one knows about it?
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.600]   I used to spend five minutes reading the Bible,
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.800]   and then like 30 minutes trying to figure out a hashtag.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.120]   Then I found Christian Girl Instagram.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.200]   My book includes over a thousand hashtag suggestions,
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.400]   like coffee with colossians, bliss, serenity, much needed,
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.920]   and of course, hashtag blessed.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.840]   Thanks to inspiration from Christian Girl Instagram,
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.640]   I took down my Marilyn Monroe poster
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.080]   and replaced it with footprints in the sand.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.640]   Christian Girl Instagram now includes bonus tips,
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.960]   like if you're gonna include your hand in the photo,
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.280]   always wear a purity ring.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.400]   And remember, anything leather bound
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.960]   is really gonna pop with that Valencia Instagram filter.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.160]   Christian Girl Instagram is great.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.560]   My devotions are now constantly being interrupted
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.120]   by people liking my post.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.760]   (phone chimes)
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.240]   Buy now, and I'll also include my additional book,
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.920]   Announcing Your Social Media Fast,
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:22.160]   tips and tricks for effectively telling people you're fasting
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.640]   while ignoring all of Jesus' teachings
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.960]   about telling people you're fasting.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.480]   Christian Girl Instagram can be yours today.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.600]   This book and so much more available to you
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:35.080]   all for the cost of less than a pair of yoga pants.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.760]   - I don't always do devotions,
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.000]   but when I do, I Instagram it.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.200]   - So awkward.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.560]   (audience laughs)
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.920]   It's funny 'cause it's true, we know it.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.320]   That's the laughter of conviction.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.160]   (audience laughs)
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.880]   You guys, if you do spiritual things
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.880]   for the approval of man,
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.520]   if you do things to impress man more
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.760]   than to relate or converse with God,
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.840]   you need to question your salvation.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.880]   You need to ask yourself, is my faith real?
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.400]   Do I really believe this thing
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.760]   that I've always said that I believed,
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.640]   or at some point I've begun to say that I believe,
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.280]   or have I learned a way of living
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.120]   that appears from the outside like I'm a Christ follower
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.920]   when I'm by myself, I'm not following Christ?
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.200]   I'm doing what I wanna do.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.640]   And so if you give for the approval of man,
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.920]   if you give to impress people,
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.680]   he says you have received your reward in full.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.480]   If you pray in a performance for people,
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.720]   he says you have received your reward in full.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.560]   These are things that you should do so that God knows.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.720]   For your benefit of your relationship with God,
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:55.120]   he says when you fast or when you make sacrifices
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.040]   and you go through hardships,
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.240]   and you do so to impress people,
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.360]   to appear spiritually, he says,
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.160]   appear spiritual, he says you're not spiritual at all.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.440]   This is what the scripture is saying,
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.440]   this is convicting, especially in DFW.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:22.840]   He says your father sees everything you do.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:27.280]   Do it in relationship with him,
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.960]   to have a relationship with him.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.720]   I want you to imagine for just a second,
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.400]   use your imagination for this one.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.600]   If you worked in a warehouse
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.480]   or on an assembly line in a warehouse,
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.400]   and so you connected, you put widgets together,
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.000]   all day, every day, there's this conveyor belt
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.200]   in front of you and you're just putting widgets together,
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.480]   that's what you're doing, right?
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.880]   And your boss comes to you and he says,
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.480]   hey, I'm going to be constantly inspecting your work.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.240]   And so he has this office that you go up these stairs
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.560]   in this warehouse and there's his office up there,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.680]   it's like this box in the warehouse and it has no windows.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.760]   And so he'll go in there,
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.040]   and you don't know what he's doing in there,
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.520]   but every now and then he'll come out,
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.200]   and when he comes out, the door makes a chime.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.040]   You guys following me?
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.160]   So the boss comes out to inspect what you're doing,
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.520]   he walks down those stairs,
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.800]   and whenever you hear he's coming,
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.840]   you're just like, game on, like you're doing your work,
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.720]   you're doing it, right?
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.160]   But then he goes back up those stairs
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.760]   and he goes into his office,
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.880]   and then you're like, hey, what's up, man,
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.320]   how you doing this weekend?
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.000]   I mean, no, nobody's watching, so let's catch up.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.920]   Man, how was the weekend, what'd you do?
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.720]   Oh my goodness, oh yeah, tell me more about that,
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.600]   let's talk about that.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.760]   And then you're just goofing off,
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.000]   and then that door chimes,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.240]   and you know he's coming down those stairs,
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.080]   and then it's like, okay, hey, game on, he's coming.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.440]   Boss man's coming, let's get after it.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:39.080]   And one day he says, hey, come into my office.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.280]   And you're excited 'cause you don't know what goes on there,
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.240]   you go up those flights of stairs,
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.000]   you go into his office, and you realize
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.140]   the only thing in there is a chair and a TV,
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.920]   and that TV is a feed, it's a camera feed
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.880]   right over that conveyor belt,
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.280]   he's watching you every second,
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.080]   that's all he's been doing up there is watching you.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.760]   And it's the realization that he's seen everything,
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.160]   he's seen the inside.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.440]   God has a camera into our hearts.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.720]   He's constantly watching the feed
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.680]   and the activity of our hearts,
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   the longing of our hearts, the doings of our hearts.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.560]   And this is why Jesus has given this sermon,
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.820]   he said, hey, the Lord knows what you do in secret,
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:25.880]   and the Lord knows what you do for the approval of people.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:31.140]   Live for him, an audience of one.
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:40.000]   So in closing, I'll tell you a story.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.400]   Right after Monica and I got married,
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.800]   we'd been married, my wife and I'd been married
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.700]   for about 10 years, brand new Christians,
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.940]   we had just been in the faith about a year and a half
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:51.280]   at this point, and we went on this trip to New York City,
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.400]   and we did the whole New York City thing,
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.240]   we did it up big, right, and so we go to Wall Street
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.440]   and we see the Empire State Building
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.720]   and the Statue of Liberty and Times Square
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.000]   and all the things that you can see in New York City,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.160]   and she wanted a bag, a purse,
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   I guess I've been told to call it a bag.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.760]   She was gonna get a coach bag at the time, okay?
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.640]   And so now it's Michael Kors or Tory Burch
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.760]   or Louis Vuitton or whatever,
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.480]   but then it was a coach bag
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.680]   and she was gonna get it in Chinatown.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.360]   And so I don't know if you've ever done this,
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.960]   I know I'm in a room full of devoted followers of Christ,
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.780]   so you probably have no idea what I'm talking about,
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.420]   but ladies, let me just inform you,
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.220]   in Chinatown you can get fake purses, okay?
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:31.080]   And so we would go there in New York City
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.560]   and these guys stand on the side of the road
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.980]   and they're like, "Coach, a Gucci product,
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.280]   "coach, a Gucci product,"
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.960]   and I'm like, "How much?"
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.160]   And he's like, "Follow me."
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.320]   And so we follow this guy, which is not safe,
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.000]   and he takes us into this store,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:47.840]   and you walk into the store
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.800]   and there's all these handbags,
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.680]   these purses all over the wall,
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.520]   but none of them are name brand,
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.840]   and then he says, "Follow me,"
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.320]   and he takes us into this back room.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.720]   I'm serious, okay?
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.520]   The wall opens up, okay?
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.720]   So there's all these bags hanging on the wall
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.560]   and it opens up and it's like this magnetic lock on the door
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.600]   and the wall opens up
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.480]   and he takes us into this back closet
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.080]   and he shuts the door, okay?
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.880]   Keep in mind, a decade ago, new Christian,
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.300]   and we're in this room
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.360]   and there's all of these fake handbags on the wall.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.880]   And so my wife, she finds the coach purse she wants
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.640]   and she gets it,
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.440]   and he's showing me watches and whatnot,
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.560]   and we leave with that bag.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.760]   And she's excited.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.600]   She got her purse, her coach purse, her fake coach purse,
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.880]   and her friend has the real one,
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.640]   and so when we get back to Dallas,
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.480]   they're comparing,
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.880]   "Oh, it looks just like,
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.720]   "look, all the symbols are the same,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.020]   "the emblem is the same,
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.480]   "look, the strap is the same,
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.020]   "the leather's the same color,
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.640]   "the stitching is the same."
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.480]   I remember that conversation,
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.920]   "The stitching is the same color."
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.220]   You open it up, the inside looks the same.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.080]   It's like exactly the same.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:53.820]   I remember this conversation,
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.280]   "It's like the same purse,
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.100]   "but I only paid $20 for mine,
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.920]   "and you paid 400 for yours,
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.280]   "like, I win, you know, #winning."
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.560]   And-- (congregation laughing)
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.940]   And the problem is,
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.500]   she began to wear that purse.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.880]   She began to use that purse,
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.280]   she put stuff in that purse,
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.080]   and she went through life with that purse,
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.640]   and you know what happened to her purse,
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.520]   her fake knockoff coach?
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:22.800]   The stitching began to unravel.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:27.300]   The seams began to come undone,
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.500]   the leather began to peel.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.740]   It didn't hold up.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.380]   When life threw things at it,
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.060]   it just couldn't hold up.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.640]   And in the same way,
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.860]   if you're here, and you have a fake faith,
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.180]   can I just tell you something?
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:48.260]   That what lies ahead of you are some real challenges.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.220]   Life is difficult.
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.880]   There are lots of hardships out there.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.920]   I get to see, in vocational ministry,
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.560]   up close, the hardships of individuals.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.220]   Lots of really difficult things lie in store
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:02.640]   for each and every one of you,
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.440]   and it's not anything you need to fret about,
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.480]   or have anxiety about,
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:06.660]   because God's got you.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:10.360]   And if you have faith, you have Him.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:15.460]   And it's enough to carry you through breakups,
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.480]   it's enough to carry you through hardships,
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.480]   it's enough to carry you through illness
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.640]   and loss of loved ones,
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:26.740]   it's enough to carry you through seasons of life
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.280]   that seem unbearable, but a real faith holds up.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.440]   I will tell you that a fake faith
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.580]   comes undone at the seams.
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.100]   I'm not talking about momentary doubts.
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.140]   I'm not talking about having to go back
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.100]   into the Scriptures and be reminded of truth.
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.680]   I'm talking about an unraveling
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.220]   of a faith that was inauthentic,
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.420]   it wasn't real.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:54.680]   God sees what you do in secret.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.340]   I am not trying to change your performance
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.060]   or to make you better at it.
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.660]   I'm trying to drive you back to that point
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:06.660]   where Christ, who prayed to God and God alone,
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.760]   who fasted for 40 days without the benefit
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.180]   of any of you there to be impressed by it,
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.620]   Christ who gave all that He could,
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.860]   His entire life to set you free.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.180]   He said, "Because the things that you have done
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.660]   "to impress people, I will pour out my blood for.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.180]   "It will cost me my heartbeat.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.680]   "It will cost me my breathing.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.500]   "It will cost me my life."
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.240]   And He didn't die to impress anyone.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.760]   He died to reconcile you to the Father.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.340]   And that's where real faith starts.
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.140]   So if you're here and you're like,
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.380]   "Man, I know that I've got a fake faith.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.660]   "I know that I've been pretending.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:52.340]   "My faith is as fake as that brightling."
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:56.900]   I would just encourage you to look at the cross
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.760]   'cause no one likes to find out down the road
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.300]   that what they have is fake
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.800]   when they thought it was real.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.300]   And likewise, I don't want anyone here
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.900]   to one day find out that the faith
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.160]   that they said that they had was fake.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.300]   Let me pray.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.720]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.820]   Father,
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:24.100]   you are in heaven
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:29.380]   and we are on earth.
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:34.420]   And so God, we ask that you would build your kingdom,
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:37.740]   that you would bring it here
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.700]   and that you would do that through us.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.100]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.840]   And Father, we pray that you would meet in this day
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.460]   our needs as we leave here,
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.200]   whatever it is we need to physically live,
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.220]   whatever it is we need to survive,
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.740]   that you would give that to us,
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:56.240]   that you would grant it to us in your sovereignty.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.540]   And Father, when others sin against us
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.820]   in the same way that we've sinned against you,
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.720]   would we be as quick to forgive them
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.740]   as you have been to forgive us?
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.300]   And Lord, as we face temptation
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:17.040]   in a relationship, at work, on a computer,
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.060]   in the mall, out there in the porch cafe,
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:24.860]   wherever we would go, when we face temptation,
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.060]   God, would you please strengthen us
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.180]   by the power of your spirit at work inside of us.
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.800]   Deliver us from that evil, Lord, please.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:37.860]   Yours is the kingdom.
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.260]   And yours is the power.
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:47.140]   And you and yours alone
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:50.540]   and only you and no one else
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:55.540]   is the glory and the honor forever and ever.
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:58.960]   (gentle music)
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:08.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
