2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 >> Porsch, how we doing?

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 We doing okay?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hey, it's so good to see you.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 As always, welcome.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Thanks for entrusting us with your evening.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 We're glad that you would be in this room.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Real quick, we want to do a special shout out to some friends we have in the room.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Some friends that may have gone to launch retreat with us.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Did you go to launch?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 If you're at launch, let me hear from you.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Man, how great was launch?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 It was awesome, right?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 It was amazing.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 If you weren't there, it was an amazing weekend.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 But listen, you're not missing out because we brought a little bit of that launch love home to share with you.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 We're really excited for where God is taking us this evening.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I also want to just recognize a few Porsch Live locations that are tuning in with us from all over the nation.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Special shout out to Porsch Live Fort Worth, Porsch Live Midland, and Porsch Live Scottsdale.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Would you all say hello, Porsch Live, with me, please?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Hey, we have got a very special guest in the room with us this evening.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 He's a minister up at Harris Creek.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 He's a co-host of the Becoming Something podcast.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And he's a dear friend of ours.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I'm really excited to welcome Mr. Nate Hilgenkamp back to the stage.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Would you all help me with that right now?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Love you, bro.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 So good to be here.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Well, I am originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Wow, let's go.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 We've got Christians from Minnesota.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 It's a miracle.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And a few weeks back I went to visit my parents with my wife and my two daughters.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I've got two girls, a 3-year-old and an 11-month-old.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And we were there.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 We woke up one morning.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 We had a few hours until we needed to be at the next place where we were going.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And whenever you have two young kids, you learn that playgrounds are the best place to waste time.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So we started thinking, hey, where can we go?

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And we realized that my elementary school was, like, within walking distance.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And I was like, hey, let's just get in the stroller and let's take them to the playground.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Now, thankfully, I hadn't been there in about 20 years.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So I show up at this playground.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And I'm just, like, hit with so much of what I remember 20 years ago.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But then I look at another part of the playground, and it's totally different.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Like this playground is just cut in half.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And half of it is what I grew up with.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And the other half is completely brand new.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And they looked so different.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 In fact, let me show you a picture that I took of the playground that I grew up playing on.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Here's what it looks like.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Yeah.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And I had to, like, do some Photoshop up there because there was another kid in it.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So, anyway, be impressed.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So I just remember looking at this thing going, I cannot believe this is what I played on.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Like, looking at it, I can just remember my fingers getting stuck in those wheels over and over again.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Like, I cannot believe I still have 10 of them.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 You can't even really see it, but as you go down the slide, there's just this, like, chain hanging there.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Like, it's a perfect place for you to just choke on right before you go down the slide.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Elsewhere, like, there's not bars in the right places.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Like, it is a playground if you're trying to build it in a way in which kids are going to get hurt.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But back then in the '90s, they're like, whatever.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Getting hurt is good for them.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And looking over at the other half of the playground, and I didn't take a picture of it because I just felt creepy taking pictures of a playground with kids around.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 So you're just going to have to take my word for it.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 It looked very different in that it looked incredibly safe.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 It's like they had thought through all the what ifs.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Like, what if the kid falls that way?

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 What if the kid falls this way?

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Like, what if he can't do this?

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 What if she can't do that?

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 It's like they had thought through everything so that whenever a kid would enter that playground, you would know that they're not getting hurt.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Which as a parent, I really appreciate that.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Because I don't want my kids getting hurt.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 But as I looked at these two different playgrounds, I just think it was a picture for where we've been over these last 25 or so years.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Because as culture has grown over these past 25 years, we've grown in our desire for safety.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Which is great when it comes to building a playground.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 It's not great when it comes to building a life.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And here's what I've realized doing young adult ministry.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I've got to be with young adults for a while now.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Here's what I've realized.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 You guys are really anxious about this time of your life.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Because this time in your life is so important.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 This time of your life launches you, if you will, into the next season of your life.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 So you want to make sure that everything in your life goes according to plan in this season.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 You want to make sure that your life feels safe now.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 But because of that, you're just paralyzed by what ifs.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Like I've heard what ifs like, "What if I never get married?"

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Or, "What if I get married, but I get married to the wrong person?"

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Or, "What if I really want to move to a different city, but I never have the guts to move to a different city?"

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Or, "What if I do move to a different city, and I move there and it's the wrong decision?"

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Or, "What if I take a different job and it is the wrong job?"

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Or, "What if I stay in this job and hate this job?"

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Or, "What if" - this is what I just heard a couple weeks ago -

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 "What if my friends invite me to hang out a few weeks in a row, and I say no to them because I've got stuff going on?"

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And then, "What if they just stop asking me to hang out?"

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And I'm like, "You guys! You're exhausting!"

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Because you're crippled by all these what ifs, because you're trying to make sure that your life is exactly how you want it.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 You're trying to make sure that your life is safe.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Here's what I want you to know. Safety is a facade.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Like, the only thing you can plan for in life is that sometimes you're going to get hurt.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Sometimes life is going to feel unsteady.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 So tonight, rather than putting forth an effort to make sure you have a safe life,

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I want to propose a better option as putting forth an effort to have a courageously faithful life.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Your goal is not a safe life, but a courageously faithful life.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And sometimes it won't feel safe.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Sometimes it will feel like you're climbing the monkey bars, and you're looking down going,

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 "If I fall, it's going to really hurt."

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But getting up and climbing is better than not climbing at all,

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 because we're not after safe, we're after courageous faithfulness.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So tonight, how do we move away from a life of safe and into a life of courageous faithfulness?

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 We're going to look at a random part of Scripture. I mean, random, random.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Like, I'm going to mention this guy's name, and I bet, I bet, probably none of you have even really heard of him before.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 I've never heard a message preached on this.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I've never really noticed him in Scripture before until a few weeks ago when I was reading the book of 2 Samuel,

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 and something about his life just gripped me.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Because we're going to look at about a guy named Ahimaz. Ahimaz.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Can you say his name with me? One, two, three. Ahimaz.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Yeah, and we see him in 2 Samuel 15 and 18.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 So if you have a Bible, open up to 2 Samuel 15, and then we're going to jump over to 18 in just a minute.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And to give you some set up on where we're at in Scripture,

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 at this point in Israel's history, there have been two kings.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Israel originally had no king, but they said, "God, we want to be like the rest of the people around us, so give us a king."

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 So God selected a man named Saul, and he was anointed as king over Israel.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 But as he became king, and as he was king, his heart drifted from God,

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 so God anointed another man by the name of David.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And Saul became jealous of David. He began to fight David, to try to kill David.

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And eventually there's this moment in Scripture where Saul's armies are fighting against David's armies,

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 and David's armies win. Saul is defeated, and then David becomes the king over Israel.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Now, he rules largely with wisdom. He largely does a great job leading God's people.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 But then he gets old, and he has a son named Absalom.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 And Absalom was an evil son, and he started to think, "You know, I think I could do a better job ruling these people than my father is."

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 So he starts to slowly but slyly convince the people of Israel that he would be a better king than his father.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 He would go around telling people, "Hey, he's gotten old. We need someone who's strong. We need someone who's courageous.

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 We need to move forward, and he's just taking us backwards, so you need to start following me."

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And one by one, it says that the hearts of the people turn from David to Absalom.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And then in a moment, there's a coup, where David and his army are driven out of Jerusalem,

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 and Absalom and his army begin to take over.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 They come into the city and begin to act like they're truly in charge.

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Now, as David and his army are running away from the city, he actually taps on a few people, a few of his followers, and tells them to stay.

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 He says, "I need you here. I need you to stay in Jerusalem underneath this false king to spy on them.

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 I need you to tell me everything that's going on so that I can come back."

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And he has convinced a few people to stay, and we're going to pick up and read in 2 Samuel 15, verse 35,

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 when he's specifically speaking to a man named Hushai, and he's trying to convince him to stay.

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 He's already convinced two other people, Zadok and Abiathar, and he says this, 2 Samuel 15, verse 35.

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 "Won't the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you?

147
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Tell them anything you hear in the king's palace, and their two sons, Ahamaz," that's our guy, "son of Zadok and Jonathan, son of Abiathar, are there with them.

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Send them to me with anything you hear."

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 So Hushai, David's confidant, arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Okay, what can we learn about Ahamaz from this text?

151
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Well, first, he lived in a land that has been overthrown by an enemy.

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 The true king has been driven out.

153
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 The good king has been exiled, and this false and evil king just rolls into town and starts to take over.

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Now think about how terrifying that would be if you were one of David's followers.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 The best description I can think of is, imagine you're in Europe in the 1940s, and you just see Hitler and his Nazi regime overtake your city.

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Meanwhile, you're going, "This isn't their land. He is not the king, and yet he does have the power.

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 He's not supposed to be here," and it would be terrifying.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And this is what is going on in Jerusalem in this time.

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 For David's followers, he's going, "You're not supposed to be here.

160
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 The good king should be in charge, but evil has come into the city and is now in charge."

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And in the midst of this, it would be tremendous terror.

162
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Ahamaz would be absolutely terrified about what was going on.

163
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 He would want to run from the city because evil was now in charge.

164
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 But in the middle of that, he gets a message.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 He gets a message from the true king, and David says, "Hey, Ahamaz, I need you to stay.

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 I know you want to run, but don't go anywhere because I've got a job for you.

167
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I need you to stay here. I need you to spy on this false king.

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I need you to learn everything about this false regime, and then I need you to run as fast as you can to where I am.

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 And I need you to tell me everything that you've learned, and I need you to go back, learn all you can, and do it over again.

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And I need you to do that because although it looks like there is a man who has taken my power and my position, he won't have it long.

171
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Although it looks like the true king is dead, the true king is just planning his comeback.

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Now, here's why I've grown to love this passage.

173
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 That right there is where we are because we find ourselves in a very similar position in our world today.

174
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 It can seem like the true king has been overthrown.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It can seem like evil is winning, but this is actually how the New Testament describes the world that we live in today.

176
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Take a look at 2 Corinthians 4.4.

177
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Satan, who is the god of this world, little g, god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don't believe.

178
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 They are unable to see the glorious light of the good news.

179
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 They don't understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Now, Satan here is called the god of this world.

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 That doesn't mean he's the king over this world, but he does have tremendous power in this world.

182
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Why? Because just like Absalom, he has slyly deceived the majority of people in this world.

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 He's convinced them to follow a false king.

184
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And if he's the god of this world, that means he has tremendous influence on the ideals, opinions, goals, hopes, and views of the majority of people.

185
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And if that's the case, evil will feel like it's winning.

186
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 But in the midst of that, here's what you've got to know as a follower of Jesus.

187
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Jesus has tapped you on the shoulder and said, "Although sometimes it's uncomfortable living here, I need you to stay.

188
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I need you to be here.

189
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You can't run because I've got a mission for you.

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I need you to learn all you possibly can about this world, and I need you to go to me, and we're going to talk about it,

191
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 and I'm going to send you back with a new mission because here's what you need to know.

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Although it seems like someone has taken my position and power, he won't have it for long.

193
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Because while it may seem like the true king is dead, he's just planning his comeback.

194
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And this is where we are if we're following Jesus today.

195
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 So if you want to live a life of courageous faithfulness, you have to start with this.

196
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 This is true of Ahamas. This is true of us.

197
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Number one, the king has given us a job within enemy territory.

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 This has a couple of implications on your life.

199
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 The first is this.

200
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Imagine how the purpose of Ahamas' life has just shifted.

201
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Now, evil has come in to reign over his city, and his response, along with everyone else who followed the true king, was to run.

202
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 He was going to have to abandon all he ever knew and run away from it.

203
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 But the king says, "Hey, I need you to be a spy on my behalf."

204
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 It just changes everything for him.

205
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 It means when he goes to the market, he's on mission.

206
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 That means when he goes to his job, he's on mission.

207
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 That means when he's talking with his neighbors, he's on mission,

208
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 because the king has given him a job to do within enemy territory.

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 He's learning all he can about this land so he can participate in the overthrow of this land.

210
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Now, the same is true for you.

211
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 When you've been tapped on the king to work for him, like when you heard him say, "Follow me," the purpose of your life shifts.

212
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Like, you're not just at work to get money.

213
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 You are there as a spy and an overthrower.

214
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 You are not just randomly in the city of Dallas.

215
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 You are here to overthrow this city.

216
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 You are not just randomly placed with roommates.

217
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 You are there as an ambassador of the king, as a person of light in the midst of darkness.

218
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Your purpose has changed because you've been given a job by the king.

219
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Secondly, I just want you to imagine what it would be like for Ahamas to carry a message to the king.

220
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Like, he and those other few people who stayed in Jerusalem would gather intelligence,

221
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 and then he, under the cover of night, would run as fast as he possibly can to where King David would be.

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Imagine what it would feel like to be in the king's presence.

223
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 After spending all day in enemy territory, after spending all day on guard,

224
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 finally you're with the king and it would be like, "Oh my goodness, what a relief. I'm where I want to be."

225
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Is that what it's like for you when you're with your king?

226
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Because this is how it should feel like for us.

227
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 We should be eager to run into his presence.

228
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 We should, throughout our day, make space to sit with him because

229
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 in the presence of the king is the only place in which we're truly safe.

230
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 All throughout our day, we're in the midst of enemy territory.

231
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 We've got an enemy who's prowling around us like a roaring lion, trying to take you out.

232
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And then you get to be with the king and it's like, "Oh, I'm safe."

233
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Now, I know we've learned to call these times quiet times.

234
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 You know, spend a quiet time. Like, go sit in time out. Just go be quiet.

235
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Think about what it would be like for Ahamas to spend time with the king.

236
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Like, he would run as fast as he can. He'd get to the king.

237
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 And then I just imagine him unloading everything going on in his life.

238
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And then he'd sit back and then he'd listen to the king.

239
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Like, there wouldn't be a whole lot of quiet about it. It would be a very loud time.

240
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 He'd be communicating to the king and then he'd receive communication from the king.

241
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And this is what it should be like when you're spending time with the king.

242
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 You're not just sitting there quietly, but you are speaking to him and then you're receiving orders from him

243
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 so that you can go out and do the mission that he's called you to do.

244
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And those times are not a burden. Those are the times in which you live for.

245
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 So, let me ask you this. Do you live like you've been called?

246
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Do you live like you've been put on mission or are you just trying to get by,

247
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 hoping it'll be Friday already so you can party, get drunk, have sex and do it all over again?

248
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I just want to tell you this. There's a better way to live than that.

249
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 There's a more exciting way to live than that.

250
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Because point number one, the king has given us a job within enemy territory.

251
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Now, the next time we see Ahamaz is in 2 Samuel chapter 18.

252
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 He's faithfully been doing his job, running back and forth from Jerusalem to King David.

253
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 But eventually there's a major battle between Absalom, the false king, and his army,

254
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 and David, the true king, and his army.

255
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And whoever would win this battle would have the power.

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 So David's army ultimately wins and kills Absalom.

257
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Now, for David's safety, David actually wasn't there. He wasn't at the battle.

258
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 So, once the battle is completed, someone has to go tell David the news,

259
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 which would be Ahamaz's job.

260
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 So, Ahamaz goes to Joab, who is the commander of David's army, and he says this.

261
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Verse 19.

262
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 "Now Ahamaz, son of Zadok, said, 'Let me run and take the news to the king

263
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 that the Lord has vindicated him by delivering him from the hands of his enemies.'

264
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 'You are not the one to take the news today,' Joab told him.

265
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 'You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today,

266
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 because the king's son is dead.'

267
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Then Joab said to a Cushite, 'Go tell the king what you have seen.'

268
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off."

269
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 So, just to bring clarity to what's happening here,

270
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Ahamaz goes to the commanding officer and says, "I've got a job to do.

271
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 My job is to communicate to the king. I need to run to the king."

272
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 But then Joab, the commanding officer, says,

273
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 "No, you're not the one to take the news today."

274
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Now, why would he do that?

275
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 That doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This is Ahamaz's job.

276
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Why would you not send him?

277
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Well, he's not sending him because he really likes Ahamaz.

278
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And the last time a king died under David's watch,

279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 something happened to the messenger.

280
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 In 2 Kings 1, as I said earlier,

281
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 there was a battle between Saul's army and David's army.

282
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And when David's army won, the person that killed Saul

283
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 ran from that battle and ran to David and said,

284
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 "David, I've got good news. I've killed the king.

285
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 You are now in charge."

286
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And David's response was,

287
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 "How dare you put your hand on the Lord's anointed?"

288
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And he killed the messenger.

289
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 It feels extremely harsh, but that's what happened.

290
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 So now, once again, another time a king has been put to death,

291
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Joab's going, "Ahamaz, you ain't going this time.

292
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I don't want you to die. This mission's incredibly dangerous.

293
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I don't know how David's going to respond.

294
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I don't want you risking your life, so stay here,

295
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 and I'll send someone else," which is kind of Joab.

296
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 The only issue was the king told Ahamaz he had a job to do,

297
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 and Joab was trying to tell him not to do it.

298
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And this is the second thing we can learn from this passage.

299
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Point number two, there will be excuses not to do your job.

300
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 There will be excuses not to do your job.

301
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Here, Joab is truly being a friend to Ahamaz.

302
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 He's saying, "Hey, I know the king gave you a job to do,

303
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 but it's too dangerous to do, so don't run.

304
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Let someone else do it."

305
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 But what seems kind is actually an opportunity to abandon the king's call.

306
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 What you need to know in your life is that you've been called by God

307
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 to run hard and fast.

308
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 He's offered you an opportunity to partner with him

309
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 in a supernatural mission of overthrowing this world.

310
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 There will be many, many opportunities for you to step aside from your job.

311
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Good-meaning people will tell you, "Oh, don't run today."

312
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Life circumstances will tell you, "I probably shouldn't run in this season."

313
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Your own thoughts and your feelings and emotions should say,

314
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 "Ah, maybe I shouldn't run today."

315
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 There will be very, very good excuses for you not to do the job the king has given you

316
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 because life is hard, and this mission is hard.

317
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 I think that this is sometimes what it can look like.

318
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 In honor of the Olympics, I brought my pink balance beam here today.

319
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Admittedly, I've seen this illustration done before.

320
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 But let's just imagine this.

321
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 You start following Jesus, and you're like, "I'm going to be brave and courageous,

322
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 and I'm just going to do whatever it takes to follow him.

323
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 So I'm going to get up here, and I'm going to do this amazing routine

324
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 that's going to impress God, and it's going to be awesome."

325
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 So you take a step forward in faith.

326
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And just to give some illustrations from my life, like early on when I started following Jesus,

327
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 I'm like, "I'm going to be courageously faithful.

328
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 I'm going to share the gospel."

329
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 So I find a friend who doesn't know Jesus, and I share the gospel with him,

330
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 and that really just totally broke our relationship.

331
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 He said, "Absolutely not. What you said is hateful and hurtful,

332
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 and I've really gone years without talking to him."

333
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And in that moment, I'm like, "That didn't feel very safe.

334
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 I didn't like that very much.

335
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 So I'm just going to get a little bit more safe."

336
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 So you lean down a little bit.

337
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And then later on, I still do go into ministry

338
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 and start working at a church in Waco, Texas, doing college ministry.

339
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And I'm believing again. I'm like, "God, you're going to do big things.

340
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Let's do big things for the kingdom."

341
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 So we rent out an event space in Waco, and we're going to do a worship night.

342
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 And I'm like, "Lord, you're going to save all of Baylor University.

343
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 You're going to bring them here. We're going to have revival."

344
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And we do the worship night, and there's about 13 people that show up.

345
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 It could hold like 300.

346
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 And I just remember laying in bed that night going,

347
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 "He didn't make me to do this job. I can't do this.

348
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Somebody else would have gotten more people there.

349
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 This doesn't feel very safe.

350
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 I just want to get a little bit more safe."

351
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 So you stop stepping out as much, and then you're still kind of trying to follow God.

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 But then a couple weeks ago, I preached a message at Harris Creek, my church in Waco.

353
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And I'm trying to help people follow God.

354
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 But then I opened up my email on Monday, and it says, "Yesterday's message."

355
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And I'm like, "Oh, this is going to be awesome."

356
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Like, I just saved this guy.

357
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 [laughter]

358
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 And it's a long email.

359
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I didn't save him.

360
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 In fact, he thought I was deceiving other people.

361
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And I was like, "Man, I'm just trying to do this mission that God gave me,

362
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 but this doesn't feel very safe, so I'm just going to stop stepping out at all."

363
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And then eventually your life just looks like this.

364
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 You're like, "I just want to hang on and make sure I don't do anything that's going to hurt me."

365
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And then you just get to this spot where you're like, "Okay, what's the safest thing I could possibly do?

366
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Okay, I'm going to get married, and we're going to have 2.5 kids,

367
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 and we're going to have a house with a yard,

368
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 and my kids are going to wear helmets all the time because life is really, really dangerous.

369
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And we're still going to go to church, and we're going to give to the church.

370
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 We're going to give like 3%, so I feel good, but I don't even notice the money's gone.

371
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And we're going to pray for missionaries.

372
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 We won't live like missionaries because that's dangerous.

373
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 That could hurt us, but we're just going to live the safest life possible."

374
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And then life goes on, and you're like, "Okay, God, my one hope in life

375
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 is that I would grow to be really old and then just die in my sleep."

376
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Like, "I don't want to feel any pain. I don't want it to be hard.

377
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 I don't want to have to go to a hospital. I don't like hospitals.

378
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 So can it just please be like this?"

379
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I just lay down, and then all of a sudden, just slowly wake up in glory and go like this.

380
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 [laughter]

381
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Yeah. Yeah.

382
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 [applause]

383
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 You shouldn't be clapping because that's a horrible routine.

384
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Imagine if a couple weeks ago you turn on the Olympics, and Simone Biles gets up here,

385
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 and she just goes like this, lays there for a minute, gets off, and goes like this.

386
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 What would the judge do with a routine like that?

387
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 She'd get a zero because she did nothing.

388
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Here's what you need to know. That's the routine the majority of Christians are living.

389
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 What's the judge supposed to do with a safe life like that?

390
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 He's going, "I made you for more. You have the support of the king.

391
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 You have a mission from the king. Let's go! Who cares if you fall off?

392
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 I made you for more."

393
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 [applause]

394
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Maybe you're thinking, "God is not a judge. I've heard that a thousand times. God's not a judge."

395
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 [laughter]

396
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 2 Corinthians 5.10, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ

397
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things we have done while in the body,

398
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 whether good or bad."

399
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 I want to be so clear. Salvation is a free gift of grace by faith in Jesus Christ.

400
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 But Scripture does say that once you are saved, there is another judgment in heaven

401
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 because he's given you a mission.

402
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 For that to be your life, how is he going to respond?

403
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 You might get to him and say, "But Jesus, I was afraid of falling off.

404
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 But Jesus, other people said I looked kind of silly.

405
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 But Jesus, I was afraid of getting hurt."

406
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And he'd say, "But I gave you talents and you hid them in the sand.

407
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 What am I supposed to do with that?

408
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I gave you a job and you didn't do it because you wanted to be safe.

409
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 You had my back the whole time. Why don't you trust me?"

410
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 So, here's what you need to know. There will be good reason not to run.

411
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 You just have to decide now, am I going to listen to the call of the king or the excuses of this world?

412
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 So, if you want to be courageously faithful, you've got to know this.

413
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Point number two, there will be excuses not to do your job.

414
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 So, let's see what happens next. Getting back in the text, Joab says,

415
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 "Hey, don't run today, Ahamas. It's not safe. It's too dangerous."

416
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And this happens next, verse 22.

417
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 "Ahamas, son of Zadok, again said to Joab, 'Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite.'

418
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 But Joab replied, 'My son, why do you want to go?

419
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 You don't have any news that will bring you a reward.'

420
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 He said, 'Come what may, I want to run.'

421
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 So, Joab said, 'Run.'

422
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Then Ahamas ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite."

423
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Now, this is the part of the story that just stopped me in my tracks.

424
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 This is the part of the story that just lodged in my heart.

425
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 "Come what may, I want to run.

426
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Sure, it's dangerous, but I want to run.

427
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 I hear what you say, Joab, but I want to run.

428
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I might not even get there first, but I want to run."

429
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And then Joab says, though, "But you don't even have news that will bring you a reward."

430
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And Ahamas has got to be thinking, "You're crazy.

431
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 I don't run to get a reward.

432
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I run as the reward.

433
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Working for the king is the reward.

434
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Faithfulness to the king is the reward.

435
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And man cannot convince me out of what God has called me."

436
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 So, point number three, third thing you need to learn if you want to live a courageously faithful life,

437
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 the courageously faithful run in the midst of opposition.

438
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And I love this moment from Ahamas because he throws all the what-ifs to the side.

439
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 He isn't stuck thinking, "Well, what if I run to the king, and he's mad at the news I bring,

440
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 but what if I don't run to the king, and he's mad that I didn't run to him,

441
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 but what if I run and Joab gets mad at me because he told me not to run?

442
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Like, what if, what if, what if?"

443
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 He just throws that all to the side, and he says, "No, I've got extreme clarity with what I'm supposed to do with my life.

444
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 The king has called me to run, so I'm going to run."

445
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And this is what I want my life's motto to be.

446
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 "Come what may, I want to run.

447
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Sure, I may get tired, but I want to run.

448
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Other people may not understand, but I want to run.

449
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 I may not have the strength to make it there, but I want to run.

450
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 I may not have any news that brings me a reward, but I want to run."

451
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Now, why can this be our response?

452
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Why can we so courageously run to the king?

453
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 It's because the king has so compassionately ran to us.

454
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 You see, there's a story in Scripture where Jesus tells a parable in Luke chapter 15.

455
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 There were two sons. He's a rich dad.

456
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 This one son, the younger son, goes to his dad and says, "Dad, I really wish you were dead.

457
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 I want your money. I want your stuff more than I want you."

458
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And this dad says, "Sure. Take what I got."

459
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 So he takes what he gave him.

460
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And this son runs as far away as he can.

461
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 He spends it on drinking, on partying, on gambling, on sex, thinking it would fill his heart.

462
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 It did not fill his heart.

463
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And after he had spent everything his father had given him, he found himself in the midst of the pigs.

464
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 He was hired to work with the pigs, eating the pigs' food.

465
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And as he's eating the pigs' food, he thinks, "I need to go back to my dad.

466
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I'm going to go back to him and say, 'Dad, if you'd just accept me as a slave, I'd be better off than where I am now.'"

467
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And as he's on his journey back, we read this, Luke chapter 15.

468
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 So he got up, went to his father.

469
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him.

470
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 He ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him.

471
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 "If this is true, you cannot keep me from running to him because my sins did not keep him from running to me."

472
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 You see, while I was still a long way off, while I had taken everything that he had given me and spent it all,

473
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 while I threw myself into a pit, he saw me in that state, he saw you in that state,

474
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 and Jesus so loved you that he ran from heaven to enter into earth to live 33 perfect years,

475
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 and then he died brutally on a cross, and then three days later, he rose again.

476
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 And he ran to you so that you can run to him.

477
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Hebrews 12 says this, "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,

478
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles,

479
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 and let us run with perseverance, the race marked out for us,

480
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him,

481
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."

482
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Ports, I think we've got three people in the room tonight, three different types of people.

483
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 The first group of people is the people who are running hard.

484
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 You're just running hard in the wrong direction.

485
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 You're running hard after things you think will satisfy.

486
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 You're running hard after pornography, relationships, alcohol, drugs, money, status, success,

487
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 a certain type of body.

488
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 You're running hard after things that will not satisfy.

489
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And I just implore you tonight, turn around and start running the other way.

490
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 You're going to see your father's already been running after you.

491
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Second group of people in the room tonight, you are believers in Jesus,

492
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 and you are really content with just that.

493
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Like you're a believer, you're not a follower.

494
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 You're not moving in a direction.

495
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 You are comfortably seated in your seat, just kind of allowing the life to go on,

496
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 hoping you don't get hurt.

497
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 I want to implore you, get up and follow your king because he's moving.

498
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 And then the third group of people in this room tonight,

499
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 you're the people who are courageously, faithfully following after Jesus.

500
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And I just want to tell you, it's going to be worth it.

501
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 It's going to be worth it.

502
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 [Applause]

503
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Like you're going to enter into glory and he's going to say,

504
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 "Man, I gave you five talents and you gave me ten in return.

505
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Here's more.

506
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Come and share in your father's happiness.

507
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 If you're tired now, if you're exhausted now, if you're feeling hurt now,

508
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 it's all going to be worth it because you were made to run."

509
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 So, in summary, if you want to be courageously faithful,

510
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 you've got to know these three things.

511
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 Point number one, you've been called by the king to run.

512
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Point number two, there will be legitimate excuses not to run.

513
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 And point number three, the courageously faithful run in the midst of opposition.

514
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 I want to close with something that ironically I actually learned

515
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 while writing this message.

516
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Have you guys ever heard about a guy named Alex Arnold?

517
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Alex Arnold.

518
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Anyone see the documentary Free Solo?

519
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Yeah, this guy's crazy.

520
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 I think we've got a picture of him.

521
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 So he's a free climber, which means he climbs massive mountains

522
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 with no harness, with no rope.

523
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 It's unbelievable.

524
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Free Solo is all about him climbing like Half Dome in Yosemite.

525
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 It's this massive rock formation that you stand at the bottom and you're like,

526
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 "I can't ever possibly imagine climbing this with a rope,

527
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 let alone without a rope," and yet this is what he does.

528
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 He's known for doing this all over the place.

529
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 If you look at this picture, one misstep and he'd die.

530
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 It's crazy.

531
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 So scientists are like, "We've got to study this guy."

532
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Like, how in the world is he able to do these things?

533
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 So they put him under some machine.

534
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 If you're a doctor, you'd know what it is.

535
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 But it's some machine that, like, measures your brain.

536
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 And they showed him a bunch of different things,

537
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 and your brain is supposed to light up in different areas.

538
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 And after they ran this machine with him underneath it,

539
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 everything began to make sense because as they looked at his test results,

540
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 they realized that his amygdala just flat out doesn't work.

541
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Why does that matter?

542
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 Because the amygdala is the fear center of your brain.

543
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Whenever you're doing something dangerous,

544
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 whenever something scary is happening,

545
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 your amygdala is lighting up, telling the rest of your body,

546
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 "You need to get out of here."

547
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 For Alex, it's telling him nothing.

548
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Like, he can do all those things because he has no fear.

549
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 As followers of Jesus, this is who we are.

550
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 1 John 4:18, "There is no fear in love,

551
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 but perfect love drives out fear."

552
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Because fear has to do with punishment.

553
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 The one who fears is not made perfect in love.

554
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 As Christians, our fear centers don't work anymore

555
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 because perfect love has driven it out.

556
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 The enemy is going to tell you things like,

557
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 "What if you don't get married?"

558
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 "It's okay. I'm headed to the best wedding ever,

559
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 the wedding feast of the Lamb. I'm going to be okay."

560
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 The enemy is going to tell you,

561
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 "What if you're in Dallas by mistake?

562
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 What if you're in Boise by mistake?"

563
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 "Oh, no, I've been placed here.

564
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 The king has placed me here."

565
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 "What if you're going to be all alone

566
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 for the rest of your life?

567
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 What if you're in this city and have no community?"

568
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 "Oh, I'm not alone.

569
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 I know my God is with me and for me wherever I go."

570
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 "What if you don't make enough money at your job?"

571
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 "Oh, I'm not about money."

572
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 "What if you don't like your job?"

573
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 "Oh, this is just what I do on the side."

574
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 "Yeah, my true job is an ambassador

575
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 of the kingdom of heaven.

576
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 This is just my second job."

577
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 Listen, there's nothing the enemy can tell you

578
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 that should drive fear to your heart.

579
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 Because perfect love has driven out fear.

580
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 Because Jesus is alive and with you and for you.

581
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 And he's tapped you on the shoulder and he said,

582
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 "You've got a call from the king.

583
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 You've got the support of the king.

584
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Now run, do your job."

585
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 And as followers of Jesus, we get to partner with him

586
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 in the overthrow of this land.

587
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 From the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light.

588
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 This is what we've been called to.

589
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 There may be a little g God of this world

590
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 who seems like he's got a position and power now.

591
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 He won't have it for long.

592
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 It may feel like the true king is dead.

593
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 He ain't dead.

594
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 He's just planning his comeback.

595
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 So as followers of Jesus,

596
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 may we have the courage of Ahamas to say,

597
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 "Come what may, I've got a job to do.

598
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 So I'm gonna do it."

599
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 Let me pray that we would.

600
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Heavenly father, I just pray that you drive fear

601
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 out of this room tonight.

602
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 I know that so many young adults in this room

603
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 are watching online.

604
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 They're just paralyzed with all these what ifs.

605
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 What if this doesn't happen?

606
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 What if this does happen?

607
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 What if this goes wrong?

608
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 What if this never goes right?

609
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 Father, I pray that they would know

610
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 that they don't have to wonder about all the what ifs

611
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 because they know even if the tomb is still empty,

612
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 even if Jesus is still alive,

613
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 even if those things never happen,

614
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 I know where I'm going

615
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 because I know who I am and whose I am.

616
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 So father, I pray that we'd leave this room tonight

617
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 sent out running with a mission

618
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 and a purpose from the king.

619
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 And father, I pray that we'd run hard and fast after you.

620
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Not confident in our own abilities or our gifts,

621
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 but just confident in the fact that we can run hard and fast

622
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 in the job that you've given us

623
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 because you first ran hard and fast after us.

624
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 And father, would you use us for your name and your glory.

625
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 And as people see us running hard after you,

626
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 may they follow in our footsteps,

627
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 running hard after their king.

628
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 And God, we do pray as we are in the midst of a land

629
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 that is under the influence of an enemy,

630
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 that is under the influence of an evil king,

631
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 I pray that you'd overthrow it,

632
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 that Jesus, you'd come and you'd come quickly

633
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 and we could see your return,

634
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 that we could see the true king coming back.

635
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 And God, we're confident in the fact

636
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 that even though this is not home,

637
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 one day we will get to experience home

638
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 where you will be the king,

639
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 where you will be the one we get to gaze upon

640
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 all the days of our life.

641
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 And God, I pray that we do that even now

642
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 because of the fact that Jesus is alive and with us and for us.

643
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 It's in his name we pray, amen.

644
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,580
 (gentle music)
