1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,560
 - Welcome to the porch.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,880
 I'm so glad you made it.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,760
 I know some of you guys are still making your way

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,600
 into the room and you are welcome here.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,440
 And I'm so glad that we get one more time together

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,120
 just to have this moment to celebrate the coming of Emmanuel

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,840
 if this is your first time ever with us at the porch,

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,920
 thanks for trusting us with your Tuesday night.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,040
 We know that there is a lot of places that you could be.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,760
 There's a lot of things that you could be doing

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,720
 on your Tuesday night.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,960
 Some of y'all left work early

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,720
 and you have work to do after this.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,160
 Some of y'all missed dinner

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,440
 and I'm just so glad that you made it tonight.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,240
 As we kind of come to the end of 2023 together

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,680
 and as this is our last time gathering in 2023,

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,680
 we at the porch, we've just been so encouraged

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,720
 as we've looked back on this year

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,080
 to celebrate all God has done.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,040
 Just to share with you and to celebrate with you

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,940
 what God has done here in our lives.

24
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,320
 We've had four mission trips this year.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
 We've had four equipping nights.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,680
 We had the launch retreat.

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,520
 Anyone go to launch with us?

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,800
 (congregation cheering)

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,520
 Six porch late nights.

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,800
 We have 200 leaders serving with us.

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,200
 We have 11 porch live locations

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,060
 around the nation joining us.

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,220
 Let's just celebrate them together.

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,000
 We've got Midland in Tulsa, in Scottsdale,

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,240
 in Boise, in Indy, in Greater Lafayette,

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,240
 in Des Moines, in Fresno, in Dayton, in Atlanta.

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,640
 And we've got people watching in Wheaton.

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,400
 And so there are people joining us

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,860
 all over the nation tonight.

40
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,560
 And so if that's you, we in Dallas are just celebrating

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,400
 (congregation applauding)

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,040
 that you are with us.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,520
 And you might be sitting at home in your apartment

44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,440
 or your condo and you're by yourself right now.

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,860
 And if you live in Dallas, I would just encourage you,

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,400
 don't spend another Tuesday night alone in 2024.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,340
 You can come and join us here.

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,880
 If there is any kids watching right now,

49
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,720
 we are gonna, parents, you need to know if that's you

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,100
 somehow on the universe.

51
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,080
 We're about to talk about the secret of Christmas

52
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,360
 and I would hate to be the one that,

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,920
 I don't wanna be that guy.

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,160
 But I'm under the assumption I'm talking

55
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,640
 to a bunch of young adults right now.

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,800
 So that's why this is happening.

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,520
 And if you're a young adult that's not in the know,

58
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,800
 we're about to have a clarifying conversation.

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,200
 (congregation laughing)

60
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,120
 Several years ago, we went to spend Christmas

61
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,400
 with my in-laws in Wichita Falls, Texas.

62
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,880
 And on Christmas Eve, we went to First Baptist Church

63
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,000
 of Wichita Falls where my wife grew up.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,680
 And there was this moment during the service

65
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,600
 where this pastor who is in his 70s,

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,880
 he invited all of the children in the audience

67
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,460
 up onto the stage for the Christmas Eve service.

68
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,680
 So you might have seen this before

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,960
 if you grew up going to church

70
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,360
 where the pastor might invite children up

71
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,480
 for the telling of the Christmas story.

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,680
 So there are hundreds of kids that come up on the stage.

73
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
 Some are brought down by their parents,

74
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,800
 some are weeping, some kids are on camera

75
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,320
 picking their nose and their parents are trying to tell them

76
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,200
 don't do that and that's happening.

77
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,960
 And he brings all these kids up

78
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,360
 and he sits down in a rocking chair.

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,700
 And this was the first thing he said

80
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,020
 at the Christmas Eve service.

81
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,300
 The place is packed, the stage is packed

82
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,300
 with young children expecting for what is going to happen

83
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,420
 later that night.

84
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,700
 And here's what he said.

85
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,860
 Looked at all the children, he said,

86
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,820
 "Now we all know there is no Santa Claus."

87
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,340
 (congregation laughing)

88
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,740
 That's how he started.

89
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,020
 And for the people in the room without kids,

90
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,520
 we were like, "This is incredible."

91
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,160
 And for all the moms in the room, they were like,

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,520
 "If you have a shot, take him out."

93
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,600
 I couldn't believe it, it was amazing.

94
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,180
 What happened that night is that pastor

95
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,380
 made a massive assumption.

96
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,360
 What was the assumption?

97
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,940
 His assumption was that everyone was on the same page

98
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,140
 and everyone was in the know.

99
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,420
 He assumed that everyone understood everything

100
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,660
 that was happening surrounding Christmas.

101
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,020
 And I just wanna say,

102
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,280
 I don't wanna make the same mistake tonight.

103
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,620
 Like I don't wanna just assume that we all get it.

104
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,740
 I don't wanna assume that we all understand

105
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,640
 why Christmas is so significant.

106
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,220
 And so tonight is very, very simple.

107
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,720
 What I wanna do is I wanna look at the most famous verse

108
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,960
 in the entire Bible, and I just wanna make sure

109
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,360
 that we all leave here all in the know.

110
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:33,200
 So I wanna unpack tonight the reality of the gospel

111
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,880
 and the right response to the gospel.

112
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,200
 That's it, the reality of the gospel

113
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,720
 and the right response to the gospel.

114
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,440
 Some of you here have embraced

115
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,280
 the good news of Christianity for years.

116
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,680
 And if that's you and you just heard what I'm talking about,

117
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,740
 you might feel like you can tune out now.

118
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,600
 No, no, no, we never get over the gospel.

119
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,680
 And so as I share it,

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,080
 what I hope is birthed in you is just celebration,

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,080
 like a renewed joy in your heart

122
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,800
 for all Christ has done for you.

123
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,640
 If you're here tonight and you don't know Jesus,

124
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,680
 then what I hope for you is that you would realize

125
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
 that there is an invitation.

126
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,560
 And then there's some of you

127
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,560
 who might think you're Christians and you're not,

128
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
 and my hope for you is evaluation.

129
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,080
 So celebration for some, invitation for others,

130
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,880
 and evaluation for some still more.

131
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,880
 But the goal tonight is that no one leaves here confused,

132
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,240
 and we're all on the same page.

133
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,540
 So if you have a Bible,

134
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,280
 you can turn with me to John chapter three

135
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,400
 as we unpack right here,

136
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,600
 Christmas at the Porch,

137
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,600
 as we unpack the most famous verse in your Bible.

138
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,960
 And even if you don't have a Bible,

139
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,680
 we're gonna have it on the screen, but it's John 3:16.

140
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,500
 Many of you know it, some of y'all have memorized it.

141
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,800
 Even if you're not a Christian

142
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,120
 or Christianity is pretty unfamiliar to you,

143
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,640
 there's a good chance that you are somewhat familiar

144
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,200
 with John 3:16.

145
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,400
 It says this, it says, "For God so loved the world

146
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,240
 "that he gave his only son."

147
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,560
 There's Christmas right there.

148
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,160
 There is God giving a gift to humanity.

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,960
 "God so loved the world that he gave his only son,

150
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,920
 "that whoever believes in him should not perish,

151
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,480
 "but have eternal life."

152
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,520
 Here's what makes this verse so incredible.

153
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,600
 Martin Luther, the key figure in the Protestant Reformation,

154
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,500
 he referred to this one verse as the Bible in miniature.

155
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,400
 Like all of the Bible is summed up in this one verse.

156
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,080
 This is the verse that 94 million people Googled

157
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,080
 when Tim Tebow wrote John 3:16 under his eyes

158
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,320
 back when he was playing college football.

159
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,040
 It's that significant of a verse.

160
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,460
 Like this verse encapsulates, it provides the reason

161
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,100
 why we do what we do at the porch every Tuesday night.

162
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,300
 Because God so loved the world that he gave his only son,

163
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,760
 that whoever believes in him should not perish,

164
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,300
 but have eternal life.

165
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,200
 So first I just wanna unpack for you

166
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,060
 the reality of the gospel.

167
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,140
 When I use the word gospel, gospel simply means good news.

168
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,860
 So I'm just sharing with you the reality

169
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,580
 of the good news of Christianity.

170
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,980
 And I wanna do it by just breaking this verse down

171
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,020
 phrase by phrase.

172
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,940
 It starts by saying for God.

173
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,220
 The good news of Christianity, it always starts with God.

174
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,060
 We are talking about the king of the universe.

175
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,460
 We're talking about the creator and sustainer of all things.

176
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,460
 We are talking about your maker and my maker.

177
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,700
 If you are a Christian and you share your testimony

178
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,400
 with someone else, make sure that you don't start

179
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,140
 your testimony with the fact that you are a sinner.

180
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,240
 That's not where the good news starts.

181
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,940
 The good news always starts with God.

182
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,100
 It always starts with God.

183
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,740
 And the good news doesn't start

184
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,400
 with Jesus Christ on the cross.

185
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,780
 It starts with God in the garden of Eden with humanity.

186
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,300
 Even before that when he spoke the universe into creation,

187
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,460
 but then he created man and woman in the garden

188
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,460
 and he created us to know him, to live with him,

189
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,820
 to experience intimacy with him, to see him face to face.

190
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
 And yet that is not a reality for us

191
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,820
 because sin entered the hearts of the first humans,

192
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,900
 our ancestors, Adam and Eve.

193
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,020
 And they believed alive that there is more joy

194
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,060
 and more life and more fulfillment

195
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,820
 to be experienced outside of God's will.

196
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,820
 And when they gave themselves over to rebellion against God,

197
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,420
 this world was broken.

198
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
 It was fractured.

199
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,220
 And so this world is no longer how it should be.

200
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,540
 And the same is true with you and me.

201
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,120
 There is a bent in our hearts toward rebellion against God.

202
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,720
 The good news of Christianity, it always starts with God.

203
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,540
 God making us for relationship with him.

204
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,540
 It says, "For God so loved the world."

205
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,820
 So let's just be clear.

206
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,180
 The good news of Christianity, it is a message of God's love.

207
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,060
 That's what Christianity is about.

208
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,460
 Christianity is about the love of God.

209
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,060
 It is not first and foremost about rules to follow.

210
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,300
 It's not first and foremost about what political party

211
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,700
 to align yourself with.

212
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,260
 Christianity at the foundational level

213
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,260
 hinges on the love of God.

214
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,980
 And this actually shows us the extent of God's love

215
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,900
 because it says that God so loved the world.

216
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,740
 Jews that would have been hearing this

217
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,100
 would have been shocked to hear it

218
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,500
 because Jews knew that God loved the children of Israel.

219
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,140
 And yet now what they're finding out

220
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,340
 is that God's love can actually reach anyone.

221
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,820
 For God so loved the world that he did what?

222
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,940
 He gave, that's Christmas.

223
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,100
 It's when gifts are given.

224
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,820
 God gave the gift of his one and only son.

225
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,100
 This shows the intensity of God's love.

226
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,620
 See, the Greek word kosmos,

227
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,340
 which has been translated world,

228
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,500
 when it says that God so loved the world,

229
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,180
 world in the book of John is usually used

230
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,060
 to refer to a rebellious humanity.

231
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,020
 It's a reference to those people

232
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,900
 who were living in rebellion against God.

233
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,180
 And so what this shows is the intensity of God's love,

234
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,940
 that a world filled with humans

235
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,500
 who throughout all ages would rebel against God

236
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,860
 have been given a gift by the God

237
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,300
 that they're rebelling against.

238
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,820
 And what did God give?

239
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,900
 God gave his one and only son.

240
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,780
 If you think about it, when people disagree with us,

241
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,580
 if people don't accept us, what's our normal response?

242
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,300
 Our response is to cancel them.

243
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,900
 If they don't agree with us, accept us,

244
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,180
 approve of us, we cancel them.

245
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,020
 We didn't approve of, embrace, accept, acknowledge God.

246
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,020
 And what did God do?

247
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,020
 He gave his one and only son for us.

248
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,820
 He gave the best of him to his enemies.

249
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,260
 This also just shows the generosity of God

250
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,460
 because it says that God gave his one and only son,

251
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,820
 which is so interesting.

252
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,020
 Don't miss what I'm telling you right now.

253
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,020
 Before God asks anything of us, he gave.

254
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,420
 He gave.

255
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,340
 Before he asks anything of us, he gave.

256
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,460
 I would imagine, and I hope

257
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,820
 that there are people here right now

258
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,300
 who hear that God gave and something in you is like,

259
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,420
 when has God given anything to me?

260
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,940
 Some of you might be frustrated at God.

261
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,300
 Some of you might be severely disappointed in God.

262
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,260
 Some of you might be very skeptical of God

263
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,540
 because you're looking at God thinking,

264
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,540
 what have you ever done for me?

265
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,940
 And if that's you, let me just tell you

266
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,380
 what might be happening in your life.

267
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,380
 What might be happening is you might be confusing

268
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,420
 what you need now with what you need most.

269
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,940
 You might be frustrated at God

270
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,540
 because he hasn't given you what you need now.

271
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,900
 You need physical healing.

272
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,980
 You need physical healing for your loved one.

273
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,860
 You need a boyfriend or girlfriend or a spouse

274
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,580
 so that you won't be lonely anymore.

275
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,500
 You need something financially to change.

276
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,100
 You need something to happen in your job.

277
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,580
 You need something to happen just in your life

278
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,340
 so that you can feel more settled,

279
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,180
 more at peace, more happy.

280
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,260
 And you don't feel like God has shown up

281
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,940
 and given you what you believe you need now.

282
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,900
 And it's not that he can't,

283
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,980
 and it's not that he doesn't show up

284
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,860
 in very meaningful and miraculous ways in people's lives,

285
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,300
 but let's just be clear,

286
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,700
 don't confuse what you need now with what you need most.

287
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,700
 Because God sent his one and only son,

288
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,460
 watch this, that whoever, whoever, whoever.

289
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,820
 What that means is that the invitation is to all.

290
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,020
 If you're hearing this message right now, it is for you.

291
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,740
 It is God's generosity and motion toward you.

292
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:53,300
 Whoever believes, whoever believes,

293
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,100
 not whoever lives a good enough life,

294
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,660
 not whoever attends church regularly,

295
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,580
 not whoever votes for the right political party,

296
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,580
 no, whoever believes in him, in Jesus,

297
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,020
 not in the God of your choosing,

298
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,740
 not just in some abstract substance in the sky,

299
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,740
 not in a spiritual force, but in Jesus Christ,

300
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,860
 whoever believes in him, watch this, shall not perish.

301
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,220
 See, that's why I'm talking about

302
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,420
 not confusing what you need now with what you need most.

303
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,620
 Because what you and I need most is a savior.

304
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,900
 And you might be like, I don't need a savior.

305
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,860
 I am crushing life.

306
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,940
 Some of you are and way to go, man, congratulations.

307
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,900
 I'm so glad it's working out for you.

308
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,600
 But you need a savior and I need a savior

309
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,740
 because here is the reality.

310
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,820
 No one is born right with God.

311
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,140
 Everyone is born separate from God.

312
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,020
 Every person is deserving of eternal separation

313
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,680
 from God in hell.

314
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,700
 And yet God in his love has sent his son

315
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,700
 so that whoever would believe in him shall not perish.

316
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,260
 That's the beauty of Christmas.

317
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,860
 That's the beauty of Christianity.

318
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,000
 That's the good news that when we deserve to perish,

319
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,660
 meaning when we deserve to spend eternity

320
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,660
 separated from God in hell, God did something miraculous.

321
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,740
 And Jesus Christ has come into the world

322
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,660
 to seek and save the lost.

323
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,460
 Now, let me just correct some unfortunate theology.

324
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,500
 Some people want to believe that if God is truly loving,

325
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,180
 then how could he ever send anyone to hell?

326
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,180
 Like if God truly loves everyone,

327
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,500
 how could he send anyone to hell?

328
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,460
 Well, here's what you have to remember.

329
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,280
 If God is perfect and he is going to be both just

330
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,320
 and loving, then you have to deal with that.

331
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,120
 Like we all want God, we all want love.

332
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,680
 We all want God's love for us in our family,

333
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,680
 but then we want God's justice for the evil out there.

334
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,880
 But if God is going to execute justice,

335
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,080
 he's going to have to do it against all evil,

336
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,460
 including the evil in my heart and the evil in your heart.

337
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,280
 And so we have to understand that if God were to just close

338
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,800
 his eyes for five seconds and be like,

339
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
 "Everyone just get into heaven.

340
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,700
 "Like, I'm not going to look.

341
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,140
 "You just get in there, all right?

342
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,140
 "You go, you go.

343
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,480
 "I don't care what you've done.

344
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,800
 "I don't want to look at it for a minute.

345
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,580
 "Just go right in."

346
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,600
 How unjust would that be?

347
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,000
 For him to turn a blind eye, that would make him unjust.

348
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,920
 In the person of Jesus, God is able to maintain his justice.

349
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,880
 That sin experiences the wrath of God.

350
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,920
 The wrath of God for sin is poured out,

351
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
 but instead of it being poured out on you and me,

352
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,320
 it's poured out on Jesus Christ, God himself.

353
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,520
 He maintains his justice.

354
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,240
 And yet his justice is paired with his love.

355
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,320
 That instead of experiencing his wrath,

356
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,160
 we experience his love.

357
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,040
 Whoever believes in him shall not perish,

358
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,520
 but have eternal life.

359
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,320
 Do you know what eternal life is?

360
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,760
 You might be thinking eternal life is just

361
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,120
 where you get to spend eternity.

362
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,160
 It's like, it's heaven.

363
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,040
 It's going to heaven.

364
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,040
 Eternal life isn't primarily about where,

365
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,520
 it's about who.

366
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,680
 It's not as much about where you go,

367
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,800
 but about who you get to be with.

368
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,680
 Yes, when you know Jesus,

369
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,160
 you will spend eternity in heaven,

370
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:17,840
 but heaven isn't the prize, Jesus is.

371
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,920
 Eternal life in the presence of God

372
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,280
 is what you and I have been made for.

373
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,680
 And here's the good news.

374
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,880
 Eternal life doesn't begin the day you die.

375
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,520
 It begins the day that you believe in him.

376
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,280
 The day that you believe in Jesus is the day

377
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,160
 that you get to begin experiencing life with God

378
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,160
 that begins today and lasts for all of eternity.

379
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,480
 So that's the reality of the gospel.

380
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,280
 Let's just all be on the same page.

381
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
 This is what the good news of Christianity is about,

382
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,000
 that when we were sinners,

383
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,680
 when we were deserving of eternal separation from God,

384
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,680
 God loved the world, rebellious humanity,

385
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,720
 so much that he sent his son that whoever believes in him

386
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,440
 shall not perish, but have eternal life.

387
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,040
 So that's the reality of the gospel.

388
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,400
 So now we just need to talk about

389
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,260
 what's the right response to the gospel.

390
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,840
 Have you had the right response to the gospel?

391
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,080
 John 3:16 says that the right response is to believe,

392
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,960
 that whoever believes in him should not perish,

393
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,040
 but have eternal life.

394
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,040
 But here's what we need to make sure that we're all clear on

395
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,320
 is that there is a right belief and a wrong belief.

396
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,920
 There is a belief that doesn't save

397
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,520
 and there is a belief that does save.

398
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
 If that's confusing to you,

399
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,240
 let me just inform you about the belief that doesn't save.

400
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,280
 We see it in the Bible, in the book of John.

401
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,920
 Listen to John 8:31.

402
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,500
 It says, "Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him."

403
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,320
 So he's talking to people who had believed,

404
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,180
 but then he talks to the same group of people

405
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,440
 and listen to what he says.

406
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,820
 In verse 42, Jesus said,

407
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,940
 "If God were your father, you would love me."

408
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,860
 And then in verse 44, he says,

409
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,400
 "You are of your father, the devil."

410
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,180
 That's kind of harsh.

411
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,420
 You know who your dad is, the devil.

412
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,180
 Okay, nice to meet you too.

413
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,500
 Like that's kind of like, tell me how you really feel.

414
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,420
 You know, like he says, "You're of your father, the devil,

415
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,840
 "and your will is to do your father's desires."

416
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,820
 Do you see the connection here?

417
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,280
 There is a belief that doesn't save.

418
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,940
 So what does a saving belief look like?

419
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,940
 Well, the word here is the Greek word, pistou.

420
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,660
 Which means to be persuaded that something is true,

421
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,420
 to trust, to rely upon, to derive confidence in.

422
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,020
 So my question to you is not just have you come

423
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,380
 to a place where you're convinced mentally

424
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,060
 of what I'm telling you about,

425
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,340
 but have you come to a point where you have been

426
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,340
 so convinced that you have trusted your life with Jesus,

427
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,380
 that you have put your confidence in Jesus?

428
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,520
 I've said this before,

429
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,900
 but the best way I can explain it is this,

430
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,820
 is the nature of a gift should determine

431
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,620
 the nature of your response.

432
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,720
 So on Christmas day, when you receive presents from people,

433
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,800
 the nature of the gift should determine

434
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,780
 the nature of your response.

435
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,900
 I'll illustrate it this way,

436
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,360
 I've illustrated it this way in a similar way before,

437
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,940
 but if this was my present to you,

438
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,140
 and you, I might give this to one of you tonight,

439
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,400
 you might get, this might be a really great gift.

440
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,860
 If you were to unwrap this,

441
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,860
 and I were to give you tonight a picture of my wife and me,

442
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,240
 anyone want this, anyone interested?

443
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,920
 Merry Christmas, this is my gift to you,

444
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,120
 I just ask that you hang it up for at least a year.

445
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,180
 That's all I ask.

446
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,640
 But I want you to think about this,

447
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,940
 what do you do with a picture?

448
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,580
 You hang it, and you forget it.

449
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,900
 That's it, like the extent of your relationship

450
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,980
 with this picture is to put it up and never touch it again,

451
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,020
 until you trade it out for something else.

452
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,560
 The nature of the gift determines the nature of the response

453
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,380
 like you take this, you hang it up, you forget about it,

454
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,460
 your relationship is pretty passive with this picture.

455
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,040
 Sometimes you might notice it,

456
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,100
 you might get to the point where you never notice it.

457
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:42,100
 But if I were to give you my cell phone,

458
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,380
 or if you were to get a cell phone for Christmas,

459
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,100
 like the nature of the gift

460
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,660
 should determine the nature of your response.

461
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,100
 If I were to give you a phone,

462
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,700
 and you're like, "Oh my gosh, thank you so much,

463
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,500
 "I've been needing a new coaster, thank you,

464
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,820
 "that just means the world."

465
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,820
 Or you were like, "You know what, this table's wobbly."

466
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,180
 And you were to jam it under there,

467
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,160
 you're like, "Man, that is such a great

468
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,160
 "thousand dollar table leveler, I am so grateful for you."

469
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,440
 Or if you left it in the box and never took it out,

470
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,700
 that wouldn't make sense.

471
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,720
 The nature of the gift should determine

472
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,360
 the nature of the response.

473
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,480
 It is a phone, and this thing is supposed to change

474
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,040
 the way you interact with the world.

475
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,120
 You take it out of the box, you turn it on,

476
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,120
 you enter your Apple ID, you download certain apps,

477
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,440
 like you use it to connect with the rest of the world.

478
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,680
 All throughout the day, every day.

479
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,700
 The nature of the gift should determine

480
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,840
 the nature of the response.

481
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,680
 So what is the nature of the gift that God has given to us?

482
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,540
 Well, it's his son, it is God in the flesh,

483
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,120
 who was a sacrifice and a substitute for our sin.

484
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,400
 He went to war with Satan, sin and death, and won.

485
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,400
 He triumphed over our sin.

486
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,840
 He ascended into heaven,

487
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,960
 he is seated at the right hand of God, he is alive,

488
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,080
 he is ruling and reigning as king.

489
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,160
 He has sent his spirit into our lives

490
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,880
 to live inside of us through faith,

491
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,440
 and to make us more like Jesus.

492
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,840
 And he gives us eternal life.

493
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,720
 My hope is that there's people here tonight

494
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
 who just heard everything I just said,

495
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,160
 and you're like, "Ah, you lost me."

496
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,160
 Like, that was confusing, that was too much.

497
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,560
 And we would love for you to come down front afterward,

498
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,660
 and we'd love to explain it further,

499
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,480
 but if it felt overwhelming or confusing,

500
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,120
 that's kind of the point, a little bit,

501
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,400
 to say, "Hey, it's so much more than a picture frame.

502
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,580
 "It's so much more than a picture where, you know what,

503
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,000
 "we read this verse that God loved the world,

504
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,840
 "that he gave his son, that whoever believes in him,"

505
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
 and we're like, "Yeah, I believe.

506
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,460
 "Let me just put my belief on the wall,

507
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,700
 "and I'll just hang it there, and never use it again."

508
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,280
 And your relationship with God

509
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,640
 is just a passive relationship

510
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,360
 that you're thankful that it's there,

511
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,960
 but you don't really need it to do anything for you.

512
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,680
 And so my question is,

513
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,080
 do you relate to God more like a picture or a phone?

514
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,560
 Let me ask you this.

515
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,980
 I want you to think about this.

516
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,060
 How different would your life be without your phone?

517
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,380
 Would your life be different?

518
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,980
 Raise your hand if you think your life

519
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,780
 would change a little bit if you didn't have a phone.

520
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,620
 Okay.

521
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,580
 How different would your life be

522
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,140
 without a picture you have in a frame somewhere?

523
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,240
 Some of y'all might be like, "You know what?

524
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,740
 "I have an emotional attachment to that picture."

525
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,260
 Most of you would be like,

526
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,540
 "I don't have pictures, I have posters."

527
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,780
 Okay, well, just, that's for the men in the room.

528
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,740
 Someday a woman is gonna change your life

529
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,920
 and your aesthetics.

530
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,340
 But I bet your life wouldn't change much

531
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,380
 if that picture was never, was removed from your life.

532
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,260
 Here's my question.

533
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,180
 How different would your life be if Jesus wasn't in it?

534
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,960
 (soft music)

535
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,860
 Would your life be different at all?

536
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:32,840
 Some of y'all might say, "Jesus is everything for me."

537
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,560
 Some of y'all might say, "My life is staked on Jesus.

538
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,400
 "I am leveraging my life for the sake of the gospel."

539
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,880
 Others of you might be having this realization

540
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,080
 that you've identified under the banner of Christianity,

541
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,900
 but the reality is that you just have

542
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,560
 kind of a passive relationship,

543
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,840
 that Jesus is information that you have acknowledged

544
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,800
 in your head, but you've never trusted in him.

545
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,580
 You've never put your confidence in him.

546
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,240
 And others of you, for the first time,

547
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,320
 are just realizing what Jesus has done,

548
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,300
 that he has died and that he has risen

549
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,000
 from the dead victoriously to take those

550
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,200
 who are far from God and to bring you

551
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,920
 into a right relationship with God.

552
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,920
 So this just comes to the question, how will you respond?

553
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,720
 Three options for some of you tonight.

554
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,780
 The response is just celebration.

555
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,320
 Tonight, you're just being reminded

556
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,080
 of the goodness of the gospel,

557
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,900
 who God is, what he's done for you

558
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,120
 in the person of Jesus Christ.

559
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,980
 So as we sing in just a moment, sing with all your heart,

560
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,960
 center your mind and heart on the person of Jesus,

561
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,100
 let joy fill your heart and let it overflow

562
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,600
 in celebration toward him.

563
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,280
 For others of you, there's an invitation on the table.

564
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:02,200
 You've just tonight gained clarity

565
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
 that you need Jesus in your life.

566
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,060
 And if that's you, there's an invitation on the table.

567
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,500
 And then others of you, it's evaluation.

568
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,920
 It's just evaluating.

569
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,580
 Hey, you've lived under the banner of Christianity,

570
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,300
 but have you had the right response to Jesus?

571
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,060
 And if something in you is coming to the realization

572
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,280
 that you've never really trusted in him,

573
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,280
 well, then that moves you from evaluation to invitation.

574
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,640
 Let's pray together.

575
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,560
 And if that's you, and tonight you wanna invite Jesus

576
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,560
 into your life, you just are realizing for the first time

577
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,700
 that you want Jesus, you need Jesus,

578
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,960
 you want him to be your savior.

579
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,380
 If that's you, would you just put up your hand real quick

580
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,260
 with eyes closed so I know exactly

581
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
 who I'm talking to in this place?

582
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:04,440
 If that's you, I just wanna encourage you right now.

583
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,900
 There's no magic rabbit's foot prayer to pray.

584
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,900
 I'm just trying to give you words to tell to your maker.

585
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,480
 You can just say these words.

586
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,440
 Just say, Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?

587
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,240
 Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.

588
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,720
 Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

589
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,880
 Would you come into my life?

590
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,840
 Would you forgive me of my sin?

591
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,160
 And would you begin to lead me in a new life?

592
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,140
 And if you're here tonight,

593
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,620
 and you just need to celebrate what God's done

594
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,980
 in your heart, then we're gonna respond by singing now.

595
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,860
 If you need to stay seated and continue to evaluate

596
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,200
 and process, you can.

597
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,720
 If you need to talk to someone, if you're like,

598
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,180
 man, I need clarity now.

599
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,980
 I need somebody that can help me figure things out.

600
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,700
 If you need to talk to someone,

601
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,740
 there's gonna be some people that are standing down front

602
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,000
 in the corners, and we'd love to talk to you.

603
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,420
 But I'm just gonna pray, and then we're gonna

604
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,600
 respond to God now.

605
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,500
 Lord Jesus, thank you.

606
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,980
 We praise you.

607
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,920
 We love you.

608
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,620
 You are a great savior and a great king.

609
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,980
 And so we worship and respond to you now.

610
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,760
 In Jesus' name, amen.
