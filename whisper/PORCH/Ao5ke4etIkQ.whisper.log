[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   As I went down in the river to pray, Studying about that good old way,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   And who shall wear the starry crown, Good Lord, show me the way.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   O sinners, let's go down, Let's go down, don't you want to come down?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   O sinners, let's go down, Down in the river to pray.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Porch, we really believe those words that we're singing.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Like we genuinely believe that there's no place better to be than to be near God.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And so what we're doing tonight is we're flipping the script.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   We're taking the entire service of how we normally run things,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and we are turning it on its head because as we've been journeying through the series that we've been doing here,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   a series called Revive, which I'll tell you a little bit more about in a minute,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   what we know is that often if we want more of God, exactly what John Mark just said,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   he wants more of us in return.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And so we want to clear space on the back end of tonight to worship him together,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   to respond rightly and really to the God that we long to be near to.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And so I'm going to pray for us, and then we're going to go right into the word,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   and we're going to go and teach this evening, and then we're going to let the truth of God's scripture,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   not my ideas, not my thoughts, but the truth of his word,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   lead us to a place where we respond appropriately.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So let me pray for us real quick.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   God, we love you, and it's crazy to even say that.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   How, God, could we, an unrighteous and an unholy and a sin-filled people,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   ever dare say we love you?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And the reason is, Lord, is because you have first loved us.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   You have made such a reality possible.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And so, God, what we know is that there is not a single person here by happenstance.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It doesn't matter where we are on our spectrum of spirituality,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   whether we have known you all our life, we recently came to know you,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   or, God, we don't know you, nor do we want to.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   If you are who you say you are, which, Jesus, we know is the truth,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   then there's not a person here tonight that is here coincidentally.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   You have something, God, that you want to teach to every single person.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And I'm asking you, porch, as you're listening to me pray right now,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   take my word for it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Like, what is it going to cost you to just lean into the possibility
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   that God has something for you right now?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I want to give you a chance to pray for yourself.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Take a moment and just ask, God, God, would you speak to me?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Maybe you're here and you don't know him.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   What's it going to hurt you to pray that prayer and ask anyways?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So take a moment and pray for yourself.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And then I want to ask you, if you would, would you pray for me?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Would you ask the Lord would speak through me?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   That it wouldn't be my voice you hear, it would be his truth you hear,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   that it wouldn't be my thoughts you walk away with,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   it would be his word you walk away with.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Would you take a moment and would you pray for me?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Well, Father, we need you tonight.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   But not only that, just as we prayed, we want you tonight.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   We want you here, Jesus.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Come have your way amongst us, we pray in your name.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Amen.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   You can go ahead and grab a seat.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Well, Porch, how are we doing tonight?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   We doing okay?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Great to see you.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Thanks for making the time to join us this evening.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I know we've got some new faces in the room.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So thanks for giving us your Tuesday night.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And thanks to not only those of you in the room,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   but all of our Porch Live locations tuning in this evening
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   or at a different evening in the future.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Special shout out to Porch Live Dayton, Fort Worth, and Wheaton.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Well, several years ago, Brooke, my wife, and I were living in Houston, Texas,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   whenever Snowmageddon struck our great state.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Do you remember Snowmageddon, the snowpocalypse?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Now, before our northern friends join us for using such a dramatic name
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   for a winter weather event such as this, you need to know a couple of things
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   because this was not any ordinary winter weather event.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   You see, this winter weather event actually impacted every single county
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   in the Lone Star State.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And not only that, it left over 10 million people without power.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Anybody lose power because of this thing back in 2021?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Show of hands in here.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Yeah, it was widespread and massively impactful.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And yet, we knew it was coming.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   We knew in Houston that we were no exception to this specific storm.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And so we prepared ourselves.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   We watched the forecast.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   We made sure to batten down the hatches.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   We pulled out our ski gear because we knew we might need it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And yet, despite the fact that we felt really prepared for this storm
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   that was heading in, we decided to start second-guessing our choices
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   whenever we realized that our thermostat internally was dropping
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   from 72 to 65 to 58 to 50 degrees.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It was in that moment that we started questioning our life choices.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And we decided we need a change of scenery.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Fortunate for us, my parents had power, which meant they had heat.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   But unfortunate for us, my parents lived four hours away.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And the distance between us and them was covered by ice-in roadways
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   and snow-covered highways.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   So we knew we had a journey if we wanted to get there.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   So what did we do?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   We took our chances, okay?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   We decided to load up my wife's Ford Escape,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   and we made the journey across the state of Texas.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Now, a shout-out to anybody that drives a Ford Escape in here.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   That is a strong and sturdy vehicle because it had no business being on those roads,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   but it actually made the drive.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   We found ourselves traversing a winter wonderland of sorts
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and making really good headway.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Like, the beginning of the drive, we really enjoyed ourselves.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Like, man, we were talking about things that we hadn't caught up in a while,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and we were taking in all of the scenery,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and we were listening to whatever murder mystery podcast was popular at the time.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   But about an hour away from our destination,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   things started to get a little bit dicey.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   We realized, man, the snow's really piling up.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Our tires are slipping around.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   We're not getting good traction any longer.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   The visibility from our front windshield and back windshield
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   was getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And it was in that moment, as a young husband,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   that I began to panic internally.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I didn't show it to my wife, but I began to worry for our safety.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And yet, like an answer from heaven,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   behind me, through the blizzard,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   came the headlights of one massive Mack truck,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   just peeling forward, plowing snow out of the way,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   and actually heading the exact direction we went.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And it struck me in that moment.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I guess even angels drive 18-wheelers,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   because we took our car and we ducked in right behind that truck.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   You see, in that moment, the presence of that truck
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   changed everything for us.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   It moved the needle in a way that we could not move on our own any longer.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   And so we found, as we kind of fell in line behind it
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   and we rolled within its wake,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   that we started regaining traction, the traction that we had lost before.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   We started finding new visibility,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   because as long as we could see it, we could see where we were going.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And the fact of the matter was, we made up time that we had lost previously.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   The presence of that truck changed everything for us.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   So long as we were close to it, we got closer to our destination.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Now, why do I tell you that?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Because in this life, everybody,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   regardless of your religious background or your socioeconomic status
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   or your political affiliation or your ethnicity
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   or your job position or your social influence,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   regardless of who you are,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   we are all seeking the same destination.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   We're all seeking flourishing.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   We all want fulfillment and happiness and satisfaction.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   The difference between those that seek it and those that find it
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   is whether or not you find one whose presence can make the difference.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   You see, there are a lot of us that are not just journeying through this life,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   but are journeying here right now in a way where, man,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   we're trying to do it on our own.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   We're walking around and we realize, man, you know what?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I'm making pretty good progress, no different than Brooke and I on our drive.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   We're like, man, you know what? This is actually pretty nice.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I feel like I'm making good headway.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And yet what you need to know is at some point in the future,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   maybe it's sooner, maybe it's later,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   there's going to come a point at which you will not be enough in your own strength.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Circumstances are going to start piling up no different than the snow around us did.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   You're going to begin to lose traction and feel the wheels of your life just spinning in place.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   You're going to begin to actually lose visibility of who you are and why you do what you do.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And where am I even going with my life anymore?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   This is going to be the case for all of us because none of us are sufficient in our own strength.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   We require the presence of someone greater.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   We require the presence of God in our life.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Now, as I say that, some of you are here and you're like, you know what, Kylan?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Maybe that's true for other people, but things are pretty good for me right now.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Like, I'm pretty happy about the way things are going in my life.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Like, I've got the job, I've got the girl, the guy, I've got my 401k match,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I've got the corner office already.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Like, I've got everything that I want.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I've got things to do and not enough time to do them.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Like, I feel good, man. I think I'm doing pretty well for myself.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And yet, here's what I would tell you.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   You might be doing good right now, but you will not do good regardless.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Something is going to come that is actually going to sideline you,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   put you on the shoulder of whatever highway in life you're driving.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   What you need is you need someone greater.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And yet, here's the great danger facing young adults.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Not just young adults generally that are out there in the ether,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   but young adults here right now.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   People like you, sitting to your left and to your right.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   You can judge them if you'd like.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Every young adult is facing this great danger,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   and the danger is that we will settle for lives of passable pleasure
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   when insurmountable satisfaction is available.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   This is the danger facing us.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   We will find ourselves just settling for quiet pleasantries
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   when there is something bold and beautiful and grand awaiting us
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   if we would only choose to follow it instead.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   You see, I'm convinced that Jesus Christ, in the life he lived,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   leaving heaven, coming to earth, living 33 years,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   and facing temptation in every way you might,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   dying a death that he did not deserve to die,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   so that way he could take your place and offer you your salvation.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And yet, not only did he die, he rose from the grave
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   and he took back his life into his own hands.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   He beat death by death itself, and he rose victoriously.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I believe that Jesus did all of that
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   for more than a lifestyle of above-average morality,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   fighting the nagging guilt of a missed quiet time,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   and living off the lessons of people who care about God more than you do.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I think he wants more for you.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   The question is, do you want more for yourself?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   If you're here, if you want more for yourself,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   then I want to tell you how to find it.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And the place that we're going to do that is in the book of Exodus.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   That's the second book in the Bible, and will be in chapter 33.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   You can go ahead and grab a Bible, and you can turn there right now.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   We've been in a series called Revive, if you're new to the room,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   where we've been studying the principles of personal renewal.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   If you think about personal renewal, another way of thinking about it is
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   rekindling the love you have for Jesus.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Rekindling, because like a fire,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   often the love we have for God can grow dormant.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   It can even feel like it's faded.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And yet, when you look at a fire that's gone out,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   anybody been camping and stoked a fire together?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   What you realize is you might see that fire and realize,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   there's no smoke rising, all the light is fading.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   There's no warmth to come near to.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And yet, the possibility of fire is still present.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Why is that?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Because there are embers glowing underneath.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And what you have to do is you have to provide two things to those embers.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   You have to provide fuel, and you have to provide care.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Fuel, that's what we've been doing here.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Like every single week in this series,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   I've been trying to hand you fuel for the fire of your faith.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   I've tried to lead us along and show you,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   hey, this is how you break up hard-heartedness.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   This is what it looks like to cultivate hunger, hunger for God.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   This is how you walk in repentance, genuine repentance.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   You turn away from that which you were seeking,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   and instead you turn towards him and you pursue him again.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   This is what it looks like to commit your life in consecration.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   The same idea that we were just talking about,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   giving up not just bad, but even giving up good to get more of God.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And then how do you persist in zeal?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Tyler did an amazing job of walking us through that last week.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And then tonight I'm going to help you understand
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   how you can become a presence-centered person.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   I will give you the fuel.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   I will add to your life the logs.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   But I cannot care for your fire.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   You have to do that. That's your job.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   And yet, here's the thing.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   If you'll care for your fire and you'll care for your fire
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   what happens is individual spot fires of renewal
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   band together into a wildfire of revival.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   That's what happens.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And what happens when wildfires take root?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   They spread. They spread.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Not just in your life and not just in our room.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   They make their way out of our doors and into your neighborhoods.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   They find themselves amongst your family,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   saving those that you thought could not be saved.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   They make their way into your office spaces,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   into your classrooms.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   They end up in your, they end up not just impacting our church
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   or your apartment complex.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   It impacts the rest of our city and it bursts out into the nation
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and then eventually it impacts a generation.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   This is how revival happens.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   And what's amazing is God is already doing this.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Like I'm not just looking at you and kind of throwing ideas
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   and hoping something sticks.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   We can look at the data, which we have,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   and you can go back and watch it
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   and see that God is already moving in amazing ways.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   And it may be bold,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   but poor, I think he wants to move here.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   God, I really think that.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   I really believe the Lord wants to move here.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   He's been moving to be clear,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   but I think he wants a special outpouring of his spirit in this place.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   And he doesn't just want to do it for all of us together.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   He wants to do it for you individually.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   But the way that comes is by us saying,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   yes, God, more of you, please.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It's by doing what Moses is going to teach us tonight,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   becoming a presence centered person.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Now, just for some context, before we jump into the passage,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   we're in Exodus 33.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   The chapter before in Exodus 32,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   we see Israel on the heels of one of its very worst moments.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   In Exodus 32, they decided while Moses was up on Mount Sinai,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   he was receiving the 10 commandments from God.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And when you hear 10 commandments,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   you can't think about rules to follow.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   You need to think about vows and a marriage.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Moses comes down with those 10 commandments.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And as he comes down, he realizes everything has gone haywire.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   These people are not waiting for him.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Instead, they are worshiping someone else.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   They are worshiping, not just a God they found, a golden calf.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   They are worshiping a God they made.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   One that they took off their jewelry.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   They removed their gold and they melted it into a place
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   where they could actually begin to worship.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   You see, to give you a picture of what this would look like,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   is this is the wedding day of God to his bride, Israel.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And they have just cheated on the groom
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   with a cheap groomsman instead.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   That's not just idolatry.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   That's treachery.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And so God looks at Moses and he says, "I'm out. I'm done.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I've put up with them long enough.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I've dealt with their grumbling and complaining through the wilderness.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I've provided for their every need.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Have they not seen what I've done?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I split the Red Sea.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   I brought plagues to deliver them from their persecution.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And this is what they're doing."
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And Moses, he intercedes, talks God off the cliff,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   tells him, "Hey, don't forget your commitment and covenant to these people.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   We have a promised land that we're going to."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And as that conversation continues, we pick it up in verse one.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   "The Lord said to Moses, 'Depart. Go up from here.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   You and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   to the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   saying, 'To your offspring I will give it.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I'll send an angel before you, and I'll drive out the Canaanites,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   But I'm not going up among you,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   because I might consume you on the way, for you're a stiff-necked people.'"
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   If we jump down to 15, we see Moses' response to God.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   "He said to him, 'Lord, if your presence will not go with me,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   then do not bring us up from here.'"
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   So let me ask you,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   what would possess Moses to say something like that?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Like, that's crazy, isn't it?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Like, I'll put it in your situation.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   What if God promised to give you the good life?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Like, happiness and health, job satisfaction, six figures going on seven.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   He decided to move you into a situation
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   where you had the perfect apartment in uptown,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   you had six weeks paid vacation, and you drove a brand new Rivian.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   What if God was like, "I'll give you all of that,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   but I will not be with you."
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   What would you say to that?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Listen, can't we just be real?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   That would be hard to say no to.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And yet Moses, facing a similar internal crisis,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   looks at God and says, "Listen, I would rather have the desert with you
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   than the promised land without you."
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   But Moses, it's the promised land.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Like, this is the thing that your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   they were promised and they have looked forward to for generations.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   This is the very land that the nation of Israel has dreamt of indwelling
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   during the 400 years of their enslavement to the people of Egypt.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   And yet now, God, he has delivered them out and he's leading them on.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   You're journeying through the desert. That's been brutal.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And yet you're finally at the doorway of it.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   It's a land that's flowing with milk and honey.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Anybody ever wonder what's milk and honey?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Milk, it's nourishing. Like, it's rich in resources, but it's also honey.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   It's pleasant. It's delightful to be a part of.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   This is the place, Moses, where God is going to take your people.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And you're telling me you don't want that?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   No, I don't want that.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   I don't want that if you're not going with me.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Why?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   What would compel Moses to say something like that?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Our first point, he knows that God's presence is the point.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   God's presence is the point.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And it's not just the point of this story.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   It's the point of all history.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   The entirety of your Bible is pointing to the fact that God's presence is the center of it all.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   It's the center of our faith.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   We see it in Genesis 3.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   We find that God is walking in the cool of the day through the garden.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And he's looking for who?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   For those that he wants to be with.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   He's calling out to Adam and Eve.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Like, it's amazing. In that moment, like, he didn't just give them a couple of rules to live by.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Hey, you can eat of any tree, but don't you touch that one.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   No, he wanted a relationship with them.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   And yet they royally blew it.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   They're kicked out of the garden.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   And guess what?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   God goes with them.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   He stays with them.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And as we make our way into Exodus, what we find is that God, he meets with a man named Moses.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   And he, him, God in his presence indwells a burning bush.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   And he calls Moses to save his people.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And as Moses goes and he saves his people, we get to chapter 13.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   And we realize that God's presence leads these people by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Later in the book of Exodus, that same presence of God comes and dwells amongst the people.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   They build a tabernacle at Mount Sinai.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And God's presence comes and fills it.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And if you look at pictures of the way it's all set up, that tabernacle existed at the center of God's people.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Not by happenstance, because he is meant to be the center of their entire reality.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   And as they go from Mount Sinai and they journey through the wilderness,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   we see that they get to the land of Canaan.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And he speaks to Joshua, "I will be with you."
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   God is going to be with his people as they go in to conquer the land that was promised.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   You get to 1 Chronicles 13.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And what you see is that one of David's first orders of business as he comes into his kingdom
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   is he wants to take the Ark of the Covenant back from the Philistines and restore it to its rightful place
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   because he wants it to be the center, God's very presence, of all his people.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   You get to 2 Chronicles.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   You get introduced to David's son, King Solomon.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And King Solomon builds not only a tabernacle, he builds the temple.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And God's presence moves from the tabernacle and dwells the temple
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   because he wants to be near his people.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Tragically, you get to the book of Ezekiel.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   In Ezekiel chapter 10, you see that as Israel continued in its idolatry and its hypocrisy,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   God's presence leaves.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   He dips out the side door.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   He exits stage right.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And yet, despite years of silence, you turn to Matthew 1 and you hear a child's cry,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   a child whose name is Emmanuel, which means God with us.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   The presence of God has returned to his people.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   At the end of Jesus' life, Emmanuel, God with us, we see that he says,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   "Hey, it's better for me to go. That way the Holy Spirit might come."
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Why is that good?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Because not only will you have the presence of God in me, you will have the presence of God in you
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   because I will indwell you by way of my spirit.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   And then when you get to the very end of the entire story, at the book of Revelation,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   in chapter 21, you see what it's been building to.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   That the dwelling place of God is with man.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   He will dwell with them and they will be his people and God will also be among them.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Don't you see it?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   God is the point.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   The presence of God is the point.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   That's what all of this is building to.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   This is the central truth.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   God wants to be with you.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   With me?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Yes, with you.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   But does he know what I've done?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Yes, he knows what you've done.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Does he know what I want to do?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   He knows that too.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   And yet he still says, "I want to be with you."
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   That's his heart.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   We know this is not just generally speaking either.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Yes, God is omnipresent.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Meaning that he is everywhere, at all times, all at once.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   There's no place that God is not.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   We read this in Psalm 139, verses 7-8.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   David says, "Where shall I go from your spirit?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Or where shall I flee from your presence?
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   If I ascend to heaven, you're there.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   And if I make my bed in Sheol, you're there."
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   There's nowhere you can go that God will not be.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   What a mind-blowing reality to consider.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Like, God is infinitely present.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   And yet, what we're reading in the story of Scripture
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   is there's more.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   It's not just that God doesn't want to be
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   distantly present with you.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   He wants to be directly present with you.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   That's what we find.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   He doesn't just want to be omnipresent.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   He wants to be manifest in presence.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   The Hebrew word, as we read this idea of presence,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   is the word "panim."
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   It means "face."
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   So that as anyone in the Scriptures,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   and you in your life seek the presence of God,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   what you're doing is you're trying to seek God's face.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   You want to know him.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Well, how do you know someone's face?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Well, a few things have to be true.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   There needs to be proximity, right?
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   You can't know someone and what they look like
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   if they are standing across the room.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   You back there, young man,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   I have no idea what the contours of your face look like.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And yet I know that if I were to come close,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   I could figure some things out.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   People come up to me all the time,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   and they're like, "Man, you look different."
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And I respond, "Thank you?"
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   What they're saying is, "I've never been up close.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   I've always seen you at a distance or on a screen."
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   And yet there has to be proximity
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   if you're going to know someone's face.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   The same must be true if you're going to seek God's presence.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   But proximity isn't enough.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   You also have to have consistency.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Consistency.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Everybody has someone that they recognize the face of
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   that they don't actually know.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Someone that--I mean, you always see them at the gym,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   and you just recognize them because, man,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   we're always in the same place.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   There is a level of frequency in our encounters.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Or maybe they frequent the same kind of coffee shop that you go to.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Maybe it's not that.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Maybe they're sitting in the same section as you here tonight,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   and that's why you choose to sit in that section every single Tuesday,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   because you know they'll be here,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   and you just love gazing upon their face.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   There is a consistency--to the degree you laugh,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   because it might be true--
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   there's a consistency and a frequency
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   involved in knowing someone's face.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   But then there's something else that's important.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   There has to be intimacy.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Like, it's not enough to be close,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   and it's not enough to be constant.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   There also has to be a--
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   there has to be an element of time spent with one another.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Like, you can't rush time with someone.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Like, if you spend a long time with someone,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   you can study who they are.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   You can learn the different facets of their being.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   I've always thought it's strange when people
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   love to look upon their beloved while they sleep.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Why do they do that?
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Because they're studying their countenance.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   You know, like, they're engaging in an intimate moment
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   where they can learn exactly what they look like.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   In a similar way, if you want to know God,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   seek His presence,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   then you need to be intimate with Him.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   You see, you can't carve just 15 minutes every morning
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   out of your day to study the Scriptures
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   or pray to God and assume that that will be enough.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   There's no one in your life that you know well
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   that you simply spend 15 minutes a day with.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   No, you spend considerable time with them,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   and no different, you should spend considerable time with God.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Moses knew God.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   In verse 11 of this exact same chapter, it says,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   "Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   as a man speaks to his friend."
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   They were familiar with one another.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Like, that's what that's getting at.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   They were familiar with one another.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   They weren't strangers.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   They were friends.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   So let me ask you here, what are you familiar with?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   What is it that you have familiarized yourself with?
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Is it YouTube videos about how to fix your banana slice off the T-box?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Is it following whatever social media influencer you like
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   and you like to know what they like to know, right?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Like to know whatever that thing is?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Is it the latest input or opinions of your favorite podcast personalities?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Rogan, Hoverman, Shapiro, Peterson.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And you want to know what they have to say
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   about whatever current event is actually happening?
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Is it an emerging market?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   So that way you can be the first to invest.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   What is it that you are most familiar with?
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Is it people in your life that you love to track with what they're doing
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   and who they're dating and where they're going
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   and where their latest travel escapades were?
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   What are you familiar with?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Listen, if God feels more like a stranger and less than a friend like these,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   then I just want to love you enough to tell you you're missing the point.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   You are missing the point.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   The point of creation is God's presence.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   And it's the point of not only this story but your story too.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   God wants to be near to you.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   You should long to be near to him as well.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And what we find is as we seek his presence,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   we find more of it.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   And the differences are significant.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   That's where Moses goes next.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   He says in verse 16,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   "For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   I in your people?
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Is it not in your going with us that we are distinct,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   I in your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?"
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   So let me just talk to the believers in this room for a moment.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   The porch is always a place for any person regardless of spiritual background.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And yet there are moments in the Bible where really the text is speaking
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   very specifically to God's people.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And this is one of those moments.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   So let me just speak to the Christian.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   I have been a Christian for a very long time.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   When I studied this specific passage years ago,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   what I found was something like a bombshell.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Like it shifted my paradigm completely.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Because what I realized in this moment is Moses is saying,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   "Hey, what is going to distinguish you, set you apart,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   is not what you know, it's not what you believe,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   and it's not what you do."
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Well, what is it, Moses?
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   God's presence distinguishes us from the world.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   That's your second point.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   God's presence distinguishes us from the world.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   It's not that we're Calvinist or Arminian.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It's not that we believe the sign gifts are present or they're dormant.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   It's not that, well, I'm a part of this denomination
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   or I'm a part of no denomination.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   It's not I read the ESV or you read the NASV, which version is correct.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   It's not that you're pro-Trump or anti-Trump.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Like all of the ways that we love to self-identify when it comes to our faith
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   are none of the ways that Moses is self-identifying here.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   You see, when you study the scriptures,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   all of our heroes of the faith are not known
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   for the theological tribes that they belonged to.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   What they're known for is that they were with God.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Like Enoch walked with God. Noah walked with God.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Abraham was a friend of God.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Jacob wrestled with God. Moses spoke to God face to face.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   We just read that. Hannah prayed and trusted in God.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   David was a man after God's own heart.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Elijah met with God. Mary and Martha, they were friends of Jesus.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And then what you see in the book of Acts is Peter and John,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   they had clearly been with Jesus as attested by the very men
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   who put Christ to death.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   In this world, you Christian are not known by your doctrinal distinctive,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   your worship preferences, or what Christian influencer
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   you happen to know personally.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   What you're meant to be known by is God's presence.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   People should look at you and they should say, "You've been with God."
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   That should be the reality for you.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   And yet this isn't the case for so many of us.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   So many of us, we major in the minors and we minor in the majors.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   What matters most is that we abide in Jesus and we bear the fruit of that abiding.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   That we produce the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   That we look more like Him.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   That we actually exemplify His character to a world that is in desperate need of it.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   And what's amazing is that as we do this, what we see is that
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   when God's presence becomes the distinguishing force for us personally,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   it becomes the distinguishing force for us communally.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   That's what Paul writes to the Corinthians.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   He says this in 1 Corinthians 3, 16.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   He says, "Do you," and the "you" there is plural.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   It's "y'all."
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   "Do y'all not know that y'all are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in y'all?"
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   You see, what he's saying is that when you're individually distinguished by God's presence
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   and we come together, we are communally distinguished by God's presence.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   And that's compelling to the world.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   The world looks at it and says, "Man, God must be among you,"
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   which is what Paul says later in the book of 1 Corinthians.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   I like the way that Charles Finney puts it.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   He's a revivalist from the second great awakening.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   He says this. He says, "If the presence of God is in the church,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   the church will draw the world in.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   But if the presence of God is not in the church,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   the world will draw the church out."
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   That's a big distinction.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Listen, either the church will impact the world
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   or the world will impact the church.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And I'll just level with you.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   People in the world don't want a church that looks like the world.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   People in the world, they want a church that looks like the church
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   and they want Christians that look like Christ.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   We're seeing this right now. It's fascinating.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   If you study the Quiet Revival in the UK,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   there are two specific denominational groups
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   that are rising in their church attendance.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   You know what they are?
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   It's the Catholic church and it's the Pentecostal church,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   which is fascinating because they could not have less in common with one another.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   You see, they are wildly different in their spiritual expression,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and yet they share very strongly an emphasis of their spirituality.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   The world looks at them and says, "You don't look like us.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   You look like Jesus. You look religious.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   You look spiritual. You look different."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Porch, to the Christian very specifically,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   it is time for the church to become spiritual again.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   It's time for the church to become spiritual again.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   We don't just gather for service.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   No, we're drawing near to God when we come into spaces like this.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   We're not just reading the Bible.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   We're listening to God speak.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   We're not just praying some prayers to an empty ceiling.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   No, we actually believe that we have a God who hears.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   We're not just confessing our sin.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   No, we're seeking God's forgiveness because we know that forgiveness can be found.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   We're not just hanging out with our friends.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   No, this is the body of Christ.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   When we gather, He's present amongst us.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Do you see it?
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   There's something deeply spiritual happening as God's people come together in community.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   As I share all of that and I talk about, "Man, we've got to up our spirituality,"
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   it sends people in a variety of different directions.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Some of you, you're worried that things are going to get kind of weird in here.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Others of you are already weird in here, and you're like, "Good.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   It's time for people to catch up."
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Let me just speak to both camps, okay?
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   For those of you that are more intellectually acquainted with God,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   the goal is to become more intimately acquainted with God.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   That's the step for you.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   That's going to require some feelings.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   You cannot be intimate with someone if you do not have feelings for someone.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   There's a big difference in knowing about someone and knowing someone personally.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Let me just put it to you like this.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Would you believe that I love my wife if all I could do is report to you the facts of our marriage?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   If I could tell you when we met, what the weather was like on our wedding day,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   where it is that we went on our honeymoon,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   would you feel convinced that I actually love my wife?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   No, because it's not in reporting the facts,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   but reliving the feelings that you're convinced I love her,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   that I can look at you and I can say, "Man, I'm genuinely embarrassed
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   about how long it took for me to make a move and tell her that I liked her."
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I remember whenever we went on our very first date,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I, like a small-town kid, did not realize you needed to make reservations
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   at a restaurant in the big city of Dallas.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   On our wedding day, she and I both feel some regret over the reality that, man,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   the weather was colder than we thought it was going to be for an outdoor wedding.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   When we went on our honeymoon, I unashamedly wanted to go to an all-inclusive
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   because I wanted to feel guilt-free of ordering a BLT in the middle of the night.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   You know, this was what was true for us.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   You know that I love my wife because I have feelings to back it up.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Listen, emotions add veracity to your faith.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Emotions add veracity to your faith.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And so what that means for some of you in this room
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   is you need to respond with some emotion.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Everybody lift your hands.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Everybody lift your hands.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   You've just proven to yourself you, in fact, can do this.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Some of you were unsure.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Some of you have questioned if I can actually raise my hands in moments of worship.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   You can do it. We can all do it.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   And as you do it, what happens is you become convinced of the very thing that you claim to believe.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Listen, I am committed--you may hate me for this--
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   but every week, having our care team sit down to my right and to my left,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and they're here so that way you have to walk across the room to engage with them if you want prayer.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   I am committed to making that as awkward and uncomfortable for you as possible.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Why?
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   So that way when you turn around and you leave,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   you will be convinced that you took considerable action,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   and your faith is, in fact, real.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   That's why we do that.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   You need to add emotion to your faith.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   To those of you that are weird, that are emotionally oriented--I'm just kidding.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   The goal is not to stay emotionally oriented, but to become experientially oriented.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   You see, when we gather, we're not seeking a feeling.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   We're seeking His face.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   That's what Psalm 27:8 says.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Psalm 27 says, "You have said, 'Seek my face in my heart.'
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   The seat of my affections says, 'Your face, Lord, do I seek.'"
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   You see, everything we do here is relationally focused
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   because we're seeking a person when we gather in this room.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   We're meeting with Jesus.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   So it shouldn't be the base that stirs our soul.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   It should be the words that we sing that stir us instead.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   It shouldn't just be some clever story or line I give you that leads to conviction.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   It should be a work of the Spirit that produces conviction.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   You see, it's not the trappings of ministry that should evoke your feelings.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   It's the person of Jesus, the center of Christianity, that should do it instead.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   We don't just want to feel something.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   In this room, we want to feel someone.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   We want to experience God.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   We want to be a people who rightly and really worship God.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Jesus describes it like this in John 4.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   He says this to the woman at the well.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   He says, "But the hour is coming, and now it's here
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   For the Father is seeking such a people to worship Him."
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Do you catch that?
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   God is seeking a people that will worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   For God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   So let me ask, which way do you lean?
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Do you lean towards truth?
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   That's good. That's a great thing.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   But you should be two at the same time.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Do you lean towards spirit?
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Then you need to add truth to that as well.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   God is seeking a people that do both.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   He wants a people that both have a faith of fact and a faith of feeling.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   That's what a full-hearted faith looks like.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   That leads us to be genuine worshippers.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   God is seeking a people like this.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   What happens whenever we lean into it and we believe it's true
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   is we actually start seeking after Him, which is what Moses does next.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   This is our final point.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   He says in 17 and 18, "And the Lord said to Moses,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   'This very thing that you have spoken, I will do,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.'"
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   God just conceded.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   He's like, "Yes, okay. I'll go with you.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   We'll go to the promised land.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   I won't just go with you. I will go with them."
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And then Moses says, "Please show me your glory."
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   I think that this is simultaneously the most confusing yet convicting part
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   of this story and perhaps one of the most convicting parts
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   of the entire Bible.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Like Moses just got what he needed.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   God just said, "I'll come."
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   And yet he doesn't stop there.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Moses goes further.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   You see, Moses, he not only needs God in the future,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   he wants God in the present.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   And the reason for that is because he knows God's presence
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   is worthy of wanting.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   God's presence is worthy of wanting.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Moses makes a major distinction in this moment,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   that while God is dependable, he's dependable.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   He can drive out our enemies.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   He can bless our people.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   He can distinguish us from the nations.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   He's also desirable.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   And here's the thing.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   As I say that, I know that some of you are just shaking your head.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   You're like, "Yes, I agree. I know this."
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   And yet you don't know it as well as you think.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   You see, there's a big difference in saying, "God, I need you,"
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   and "God, I want you."
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Both are good and both are necessary, but both are different.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   One is about sustenance and the other is about satisfaction.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   So I'll put it to you this way.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Sustenance is about getting what we need.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   If you've ever been backpacking, then what you know is
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   the food you eat on the trail is anything less than a five-course meal.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Your meals consist of things like mac and dac, you know,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   sausage and beans, rice and tuna.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   This is the food you eat. Why?
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Because the goal isn't satisfaction. The goal is sustenance.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   You know what your body needs.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   It needs nourishment, and so you're willing to eat
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   protein and carbs to keep you going down the trail ahead.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   And yet, sustenance ends the minute you come off the mountain.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   The minute you return to the big city,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   your eyes are not looking for that which will nourish my needs.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Instead, you start looking for that which will satisfy my stomach.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   You start moving towards that which you want.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   When my friends and I would go backpacking,
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   we would, in the final few days, dream about what we would eat.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Double cheeseburgers, pizza, meat lovers only,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   steak and potatoes, because that's actually the only right answer.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   We would start fantasizing about the food we would find,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   because long gone were the days of seeking sustenance.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Now was the day of seeking satisfaction.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   There's a big difference in pursuing what you need and pursuing what you want.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   You see, so many young adults that I visit with,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   and I need you to hear me on this,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   you have heard repeatedly from this stage and stages like it,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   so you know it very well, that Jesus is the source of all satisfaction.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Why then does your relationship only exist around sustenance?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   You see, often we come to Jesus on the basis of what we need.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   "Jesus, I need your help because I've got this conversation coming up at work,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   and my boss is crazy," or "Jesus, I need you to give me some support
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   because a conflict with my mom, it never goes well,"
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   or "Jesus, I need you because my chronic pain, it's crippling."
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   And listen, Jesus, he delights to be needed.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   That is part of the Christian experience.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Do not be mistaken.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   We need Jesus to save us from our sin, to forgive us of our trespasses,
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   to heal us of our hearts, to be the Lord of our life.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   We need Jesus, but he is also worthy of wanting.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   You see, so very often we need Jesus, but we don't want him.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   And the reason for that is because when we're out of options,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   he's always the one we turn to.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   But when we have other options, he's seldom, if ever, the one we turn to.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   You see, you'll have a free Saturday morning,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   and so you'll hit the gym, you'll go to spin, you'll take a brunch,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   you'll do whatever it is that you want,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   when in reality, I mean, you actually,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   you could take some of that time to read the word.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   You'll have some downtime at the office,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   and so you'll spend it shopping for a new top for the summer,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   for a dress for that wedding, new shoes to add to your collection,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   and you'll try to bury it in a million different tabs
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   so your boss will never know.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   And yet, what if you took the time
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   and you journaled five things you're grateful for to Jesus instead?
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   You'll have an evening free, for once.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   And you could take the evening and you could seek him, pray to him.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   But Love Island just came out two weeks ago,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   and I'm already one episode behind.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Listen, we laugh at this stuff, but we do this stuff.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   I do this stuff.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   We are all a part of this moment together.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Let me be very clear.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Jesus is not trying to guilt trip you.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   He's not against your pastimes or your hobbies.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   He might be against Love Island,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   but what we do know is that Jesus,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   he wants to satisfy you,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   and yet, if we only ever interact with him out of need,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   we should never be expected to be satisfied.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   You cannot come to him in moments where you are needing sustenance
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   and you expect him to give you satisfaction.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   You have to come to him when the options are open
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   and you choose him instead because you want him most.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   A.W. Tozer, one of my favorite quotes says,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   "Complacency is a deadly foe of all spiritual growth.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Acute desire, desire, must be present
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   or there will be no manifestation of Christ to his people.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   He waits to be wanted too bad,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   too bad that with many of us,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   he waits so long, so very long in vain."
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   God waits to be wanted, not just needed.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   So friends, we shouldn't want for more of God.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Friends, we should want for more of God
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   and not just need more from God.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Moses wanted more of God,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   and so God gave Moses more of himself.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   This is where we'll end.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   In 19 and 20, he said,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   "I will make my goodness pass before you
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   and will proclaim before you the name of the Lord,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   and I'll show mercy on whom I will show mercy,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   but," he said, "you can't see my face,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   for man shall not see me and live."
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Friends, listen, do you want more of God?
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   Then you can have him.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   You can have more of God,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   and you can have more of God in a way
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   that Moses himself could not have.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   For Moses could not look upon the face of God,
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   but we have looked upon the face of God
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   and that we have seen Jesus Christ himself.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Moses, he knew that he could not see God and live,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   and yet those who live have seen God
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   and that they have seen Jesus himself.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Moses, he asked to see God's glory,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   but we have seen God's glory
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   in that Jesus is the radiance of the glory of God
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   and the exact imprint of his nature.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   You see, we know that.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   Jesus always understood God's presence is the point.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   God has always longed to be near us,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   and in order to make that happen,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Jesus came close to us.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   He left heaven, he came to earth,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   not just to save someone's general sins,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   but to save you from yours.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   We know that Jesus understood it's my presence
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   which will distinguish them,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   and so I will live and die and rise
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   that they might have my presence within them,
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   my Holy Spirit that will distinguish them
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   from the rest of the world.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   We can also be convinced that Jesus knew,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   man, my presence is worthy of wanting,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   but they don't want it.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   They don't want it because they do not realize
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   that their wanting is warranted,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   and so I, I will want them first.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   I will come closest to them,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   and by way of me doing so, they will want me,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   not just today, not just tomorrow, but forever.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Do you want Jesus here tonight?
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   We're gonna move into a time
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   where we're singing in worship
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   as a declaration of our desire that God, we want you.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   If you don't want him, then what you need to know
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   is we've got some people down front
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   that would love to pray with you,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   and the walk is awkward, and it's very uncomfortable,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   and yet they would love to process with you
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   why you may be lacking in desire,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   but we wanna take time over the rest of the evening,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   and we just wanna sing, and we wanna respond,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   and we wanna rejoice because we believe
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   not just in head, but in heart
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   that he is worthy of wanting,
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   and we want to convince him that that's true.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   Let me pray that we would.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Father, we love you.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   We said it at the beginning.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   We believe that now.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   I'm grateful that your word is so very sufficient,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   that Jesus, you have met us in our need,
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   and now, God, we pray you would cultivate our desire,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   that you would hear from us hearts of worship,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   worship of wanting, desire to be near.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   Would the cry of this room be yearning, longing
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   to have more of you?
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   We sing to you now.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   It's in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   You can stand where you are,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   and you can respond as you feel led.
