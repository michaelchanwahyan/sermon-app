[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.640]   - Hey, hey, Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.840]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.720]   It's great to be here with my friends in Dallas
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.760]   and Fort Worth and spread all over Texas
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.560]   and the Southwest and every other place you're listening.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.640]   We know around the globe and overseas,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.680]   you're tracking with us.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.520]   My name is Todd.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.000]   I love when I get to jump in with you guys.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.080]   And we are going to just this week,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.560]   take a little bit of time,
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.600]   looking at a section of God's word
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.920]   that has really, really been useful in my life.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.120]   I often get asked the question,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.880]   what's your favorite book of the Bible?
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.200]   And so for me, if I had to be honest,
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.620]   it really is, and I say this all the time,
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.920]   it's whatever book I'm studying
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040]   because there's always more there than I think.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.040]   I mean, books that I've been around for a long time,
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.920]   when I really begin to just sit on them
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.920]   and study and reflect and ask questions,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.040]   man, I always see so much truth
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.080]   that I either missed the first time
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.880]   or just forgot was there.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.720]   So whatever book I'm spending the most time in,
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320]   at any given time, when I'm teaching through some series
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.520]   at Watermark, wherever it might be,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.480]   that becomes my favorite book.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.840]   But if I had to just say this one book
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.680]   that has been the most useful in my life,
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.560]   not in order to help me understand my own sin
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.840]   and my own need for Jesus,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.280]   but a book that has changed me
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.220]   more than any other book in the Bible,
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.960]   it would be a book called Proverbs.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.000]   And it's a book that is written for idiots like me
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.200]   of a very short attention span
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.560]   because it kind of just speaks to you in jabs
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.480]   and quick punches and little pithy statements.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.600]   This is the way the book of Proverbs starts.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.920]   Listen to this.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.640]   This is chapter one of a collection of wisdom sayings.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.840]   Okay, now wisdom, all wisdom is,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.000]   is knowledge wrapped up in understanding,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.640]   which is to say a life that takes truth
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.000]   and rightly applies it is a life that's marked by wisdom.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.640]   This is what it says.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.200]   It says the Proverbs of Solomon,
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.520]   who if you know the story about Solomon,
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.280]   he could ask God whatever he wanted.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.640]   And what he asked for was that he would have wisdom,
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.000]   that he would not just know things.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.060]   'Cause here's the deal, right?
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.580]   Most of you guys know more
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.020]   than you're applying to your life already.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.880]   Look, we all know what we're supposed to eat
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.760]   if we wanna feel like and look like we wanna feel like
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.240]   and look like.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.160]   That doesn't mean we always eat that way,
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.840]   exercise that way.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.920]   We all know a lot of times what's good for us
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.960]   and we just don't apply it correctly to our lives.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.160]   And so what Solomon asked for was wisdom.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.540]   He didn't just want intellectual understanding.
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.960]   He wanted intellectual truth applied.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.240]   And so he says this, this is why I wrote this.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.200]   So this is why this has been a book that's good for me.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.720]   To know wisdom and instruction,
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.280]   that you might know wisdom and you might be instructed,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.560]   you might discern the sayings of understanding
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.400]   so that you can receive instruction in wise behavior,
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.840]   righteousness, justice, and equity.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.920]   In other words, so you won't screw your life up.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.020]   So you won't have more scars than joy.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.680]   It'll give you prudence.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.360]   It doesn't say it'll make you a prude.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.080]   It says it'll give you prudence,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   which means wise living,
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.840]   the ability to do the right thing
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.640]   at the right time in the right way.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.640]   And then it says a wise man will hear
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.360]   and increase in learning and a man of understanding
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.240]   will acquire wise counsel.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.400]   You'll understand a proverb and a figure,
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.840]   the words of their wives and their riddles.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.040]   'Cause sometimes when you read this,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.600]   it doesn't quite make sense.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.520]   You're like, what's that mean?
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.560]   I gotta pick the lock on that.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.000]   And all through Proverbs,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.560]   you're gonna find out what God's trying to do
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.340]   because he's a loving father.
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.420]   And see, I didn't know that for a long time.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.080]   This was my view of God,
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.240]   that everything I wanted to do,
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.800]   he was gonna say, get your hands off that.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.920]   And everything I didn't wanna do,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.780]   he's like, get out of bed, let's go.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.620]   And I was like, really?
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.100]   I mean, I don't think that's what I want.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.740]   And that was because I made God in my own image.
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.340]   I never really stopped and asked God who God was.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.000]   I never listened to what God said he was.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.380]   I never let him reveal himself to me.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.340]   This book is revelation.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.140]   It's showing me what I otherwise would know.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.900]   Because even though I'm made in God's image,
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.380]   I've left him.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.500]   And so what I usually do in my broken and fallen state
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.140]   is I make God in my image.
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.420]   And God's not broken.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.420]   God's not selfish.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.340]   And God's not impetuous.
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.860]   And God's not controlling.
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.800]   He's sovereign.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.720]   And he loves me.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.500]   And he loves you.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.860]   So we put together this amazing book.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.380]   Listen, listen to these little pleadings.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.200]   This is Proverbs chapter 22 in verse 17.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.040]   He just says this.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.900]   This is a loving father,
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.580]   and he's just begging you to just tune in.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.080]   He's saying, incline your ear
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.020]   and hear the words of the wise.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.320]   Because I'm not looking to rip you off.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.780]   I'm looking to set you free
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.700]   and apply your mind to my knowledge because I love you.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.500]   It will be pleasant if you keep them within you.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.860]   See, let me just tell you something.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.580]   If when you think of following God,
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.700]   if you don't think of pleasant and good things,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.380]   then you have been deceived,
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.060]   just like I was for a long time.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.160]   That's what the deceiver is.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.000]   He's a liar.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.340]   He's been a liar from the beginning.
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.180]   And he always wants you to believe that God's not good,
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.120]   his words not true,
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.660]   and disobeying him is not gonna cost you that much.
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.860]   So listen to this pleading.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.720]   So that you may trust the Lord,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.980]   the Lord who is slow to anger,
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.100]   bounding in loving kindness,
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.620]   compassionate, gracious,
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.140]   full of grace and truth.
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.180]   He says, I've taught you today, even today,
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.580]   have I not written to you excellent things
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.860]   of counsels and knowledge,
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.180]   so that you might know with certainty the words of truth.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.100]   Jesus says it's the truth that's gonna set you free
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.460]   and it's gonna break you out of this rut
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.600]   that we always get ourself into.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   Now here's what I wanna do.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.740]   I wanna read to you,
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.040]   not just a proverb by itself,
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.560]   but every now and then there's groupings.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.720]   And there's a group of proverbs that are together.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.640]   And then what I wanna teach you to do
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.680]   is how to read your Bible
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.520]   in a way that's gonna make it meaningful to you, okay?
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.280]   So the proverb, the little section of proverbs
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.480]   that I want you to get with me tonight and learn from,
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.120]   what's been really helpful to me,
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.100]   is found in Proverbs chapter 24, verses 30 through 34, okay?
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.140]   Now just hang with me.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.500]   Here we go, I'm gonna just pray.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.660]   Father, man, if there's truth,
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.220]   if you're good and you love us
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.440]   and there's something you want us to see,
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.900]   would you just show it to us tonight,
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.060]   wherever we're at,
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.980]   whether we're just trying to figure out
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.060]   who you are for the first time
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.380]   or whether we've known you for a while
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.580]   and wanna learn to love you more
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.220]   so we will love that which will lead to life indeed,
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.420]   would you just show it to us?
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.220]   I thank you that the way you describe yourself,
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.980]   if we would listen, is as a loving father
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.500]   who has our best interests in mind.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.540]   And so we don't have to figure this thing out.
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.100]   You just say, come here, let me,
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.900]   are you weary, are you heavy laden, are you burdened?
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.700]   Then just come, for my yoke is easy, my burden is light.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.080]   And so Father, some of us are hungry, our soul is starved,
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.380]   and we're gonna knock tonight on the door of your grace
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.280]   and you tell us, if we knock on that door,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.500]   that you're gonna open it and you're gonna invite us in.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.300]   And we're gonna dine with you and we're gonna feast.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.960]   It's gonna make it better for us.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.140]   Lord, we just acknowledge that we've been lied to a lot.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.580]   We think that you're sometimes oppressive and controlling
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.980]   and that all you wanna do is slap our hands
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.280]   and we realize, when we look at your word
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.740]   and see who you've been through history,
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.580]   that we're just victims of a lie.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.860]   And so help us see truth tonight.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.500]   Teach us, make us wise sons and daughters
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.220]   who learn from you, amen.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.060]   All right, now check this out.
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.000]   This is a little section of Proverbs.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.300]   It's unusual because it's really a story
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.700]   and what he's trying to show you in this story
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.780]   is some things that if you'll just pay attention to it,
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.180]   your loving Father wants you to learn from.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.260]   So I'm gonna read it to you all.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260]   It says Proverbs 24, 30 through 34.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.660]   It says, "I passed by the field of the sluggard
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.780]   "and by the vineyard of a man who lacked sense.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.940]   "And behold, it was completely overgrown with thistles,
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.380]   "the sluggard's vineyard and field.
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.520]   "Its surface was covered with nettles
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.620]   "and its stone walls were broken down.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.520]   "When I saw, when I reflected upon it,
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.500]   "I looked, I received instruction.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.980]   "A little sleep, a little slumber,
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.000]   "a little folding of the hands to rest
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.720]   "and then your poverty will come upon you like a robber
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.120]   "and your want like an armed man."
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.180]   Okay, now look, you read something like that
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.540]   and let's just say for just a second,
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.220]   you're gonna go, okay, Lord, teach me something
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.700]   and you read that little story and you're like,
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.660]   well, what gives?
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.500]   Right, that's the thing you want me to be encouraged by?
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.580]   How can I learn from that?
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.600]   Okay, now here's how.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.100]   Whenever you read your Bible, you wanna just stop, okay,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.620]   and you wanna just start to make some basic observations
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.560]   and then from those observations, you wanna go,
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.580]   okay, now I've seen these things,
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.780]   what am I supposed to learn from things that I've seen
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.280]   and how can I apply them to my life?
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.200]   It's just a simple thing called observation,
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.100]   interpretation, application.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.480]   And so when you read a story like that,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.700]   you gotta go, okay, what's there?
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.380]   What's he want me to see, okay?
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.920]   And so what he's telling you is that this guy
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.660]   is walking through life, okay, and as he walks through life,
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.420]   he is observing things in other people.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.400]   Can I just tell you something?
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.480]   This is a fact.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.580]   Every single person you meet is either a wonderful example
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.460]   or their life serves as a horrible warning.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.500]   They're one of two things.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.700]   In some way, every man is your teacher.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.380]   Everybody you meet is a teacher.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.500]   I sometimes, you know, when I'm around people,
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.140]   they go, man, I don't like my coach, I don't like my teacher,
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.380]   I don't like my boss, and I go, well, then learn from them
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.580]   because you're gonna be a boss one day,
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.860]   you're gonna be a dad one day,
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.580]   you're gonna be a husband one day,
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.560]   you're gonna be a friend, and so if that friend
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.300]   is bothering you and badgering you, learn from them.
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.240]   Go, I don't want to do that.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.420]   And all he's just saying is this.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.680]   Here's the very first thing I want you to get
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.760]   out of what we're doing right now,
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.540]   and that is just this little statement,
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.700]   and that is that experience, experience is a good teacher,
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.420]   but it's a very expensive one.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.020]   Because experience, right, experience is,
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.980]   while it teaches you in an amazing way,
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.660]   it often gives you the final exam
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.780]   before the very first lesson, right?
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.880]   I mean, you can learn that mines blow you up
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.620]   and cause you to lose your leg by stepping on a mine.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.700]   You've learned that, right?
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.140]   As well as anybody who's learned that,
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.180]   you know you don't want to step on a landmine.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.060]   But that's a very expensive way to learn
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.140]   that you don't go stepping on landmines.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.060]   Some of you have learned a very expensive lesson
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.300]   that when a guy says he loves you,
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.340]   and if you love him, you'd share yourself with him,
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.500]   and then he'll always be there, and you're a single mom.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.000]   You have learned that guys say whatever they need to say
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.500]   to get whatever they want sometimes,
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.700]   and you know that you can't always trust a man
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.140]   in the heat of a moment, and you've learned that,
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.060]   and you've learned it in a very expensive way.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.660]   Some of you guys have learned from Planned Parenthood
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.500]   that it's not just a small procedure
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.300]   with no lasting consequences.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.980]   You know that that's a lie.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.520]   You know that this Mother's Day, when it comes around,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.860]   that there should be a life that should be looking at you
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.340]   with loving eyes and be grateful for you, and you won't,
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.660]   and it's gonna haunt you on Mother's Day.
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.040]   You've learned that it's a lie,
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.200]   that it's just a clump of cells,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.620]   it's not a life inside of you,
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.920]   and you've learned it in a very expensive way.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.860]   And God just wants you to know
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.220]   that there's a better way to go about learning things.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.480]   The trouble with using experience as a guide,
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.580]   as again, as I said, is that sometimes you get tested
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.220]   before you get instructed.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.300]   But we say this all the time, right?
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.220]   Experience is the best teacher.
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.580]   Nothing beats experience.
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.860]   Yes, something beats experience.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.560]   Do you know what beats experience?
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.980]   What beats experience is learning
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.480]   from other people's experiences
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.280]   so you don't have to step on a landmine.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.080]   Have a child out of wedlock,
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.320]   or have a child taken out of your womb,
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.400]   and realize that there's more truth than you were told.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.360]   So a wise guy said this a long time ago,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   and that is that wise men learn more from fools
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.280]   than fools learn from wise men.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.840]   Because why wise men will learn from the follies of fools,
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.240]   fools will learn from the follies of fools
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.480]   fools will not learn from the wisdom of the wise.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.360]   Can I say that to you again?
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.920]   Wise men learn more from fools than fools do from wise men.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.200]   Doesn't that seem backwards?
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.240]   Like if you're a fool, you're like,
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.760]   man, let's watch this guy's life.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.520]   And what the truth is, is fools never learn from wise men.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.160]   They only learn when they get beaten to death.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.320]   In fact, this is what it says
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.200]   in Proverbs chapter 17, verse 10.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.560]   This is just a wisdom principle that is true.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.480]   And it says this, a rebuke, which is a simple admonishment,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.520]   like, bro, I wouldn't go there, don't do that,
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.840]   it's not gonna go well with you.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.440]   A rebuke goes deeper into one who has understanding
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.480]   than a hundred blows to a fool.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.520]   'Cause a fool continually thinks like,
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.640]   well, that didn't work out that time,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.360]   but I'm gonna kinda, I'll do it again, right?
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.700]   It's like, you know, it's like the guy,
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.960]   you can tell this joke a thousand ways.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.640]   I was just with a couple of guys that were in special forces.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.800]   They were both in special forces,
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.120]   one kind of in the Naval branch, one in the Army branch.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.000]   So maybe it was with a Navy SEAL and with a Ranger.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.040]   And they're always jacking with each other, right?
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.040]   And the guy told a story, he just said this, he's like,
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.760]   you know, there was a Navy SEAL and a Ranger
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.000]   that were together, okay?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.880]   And often you hear this, like, with a Marine and a guy
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.080]   who's the infantry, right?
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.480]   So however you wanna tell it,
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.120]   you can tell it like the normal world and Aggies.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.840]   So just anything like that, right?
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.560]   Two different people.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.800]   So let's just tell it that way, right?
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.120]   So there's a guy standing there next to his Aggie friend.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.840]   And they're sitting there and there's a guy,
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.920]   they're watching TV and there's a guy on a roof, right?
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.560]   And he's looking to jump and commit suicide.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.600]   And so the two guys are watching it
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.080]   and they're leaning in there, they go, oh my gosh.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.120]   You know, and the one guy leans over,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.080]   he goes, I bet you 20 bucks, the guy jumps.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.800]   And the friend saw, you know, that they were getting
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.320]   people all in place to talk to him.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.360]   There's folks on bullhorns, they were trying to get a net
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.200]   and the guy looks at him, he assesses it, he goes, no.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.600]   He goes, I'll take that bet, he won't jump.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.200]   And then sure enough, man, the guy jumped
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.520]   about three minutes later.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.960]   And so the guy reached his pocket and he slapped down,
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.320]   gave the guy 20, put it in his pocket.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.640]   And a few minutes later, he leaned over to his friend,
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.380]   he said, listen, I can't lie to you, bro.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.600]   That was a replay of the news that happened at noon, right?
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.360]   I knew what happened, I knew the guy jumped, right?
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.640]   And so I wanna give you your money back.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.240]   And the guy goes, no, the Aggie says, no, man,
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   I'm not gonna take your money back.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.120]   He goes, I saw the guy jump at noon too,
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.320]   I just didn't think he was stupid enough to do it twice.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.720]   It's funny.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.240]   Explain it to your friend later, all right?
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.180]   Your Aggie friend.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:05.320]   But sometimes, that's the way it is with a fool, right?
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.280]   That's the way it is with a fool.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.000]   They keep doing things like 100 times,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.880]   and if it doesn't kill them,
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.160]   they're gonna just keep going back again,
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.000]   and they're gonna think the problem
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   is that the world's unjust somehow.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.520]   And so the Bible is just saying,
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.720]   man, it's better that you learn a different way.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.800]   Experience is not the best teacher.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:25.680]   Or at the very least, it's a very, very expensive one.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.080]   This is what the Bible says.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.960]   The prudent, this is Proverbs 22, three.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.680]   The prudent sees evil, and he hides himself.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.880]   But the naive, the fool, he goes on,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.200]   and he's punished for it.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.840]   Right, haven't we all seen people that date bad boys
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.480]   and it not work out well for 'em?
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.360]   Haven't we all seen people who try and get their validation
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.800]   by other humans and find their meaning
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.000]   in fleeting things in the world,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.840]   and it doesn't work out for 'em?
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.960]   Haven't we all seen people that try and deal
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.520]   with their sorrows with drinking and with drug use
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.080]   or with isolation, and we go,
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.520]   it doesn't work out well for 'em?
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.400]   And the prudent, they see that, and they go,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.920]   okay, I'm not gonna go that way.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.560]   But the naive, they just go on, right?
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.400]   That's part of the deceitfulness of sin
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.040]   is that we all think we're gonna be the one
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.480]   that can handle it and go this way
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.180]   that's not gonna really affect us.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.300]   And so it's just a fact that experience,
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.780]   in a sense, is a good teacher,
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.700]   but it's a very, very expensive one.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.220]   So a wise man does learn from his mistakes,
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.220]   but a wiser man still learns from the mistakes of others.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.420]   What this little section of Scripture is all about
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.220]   is like, hey, be that wise man,
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.780]   and always be looking, always be observing,
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.780]   so that what you're gonna see in this story
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.660]   is there's a guy, and he's walking by,
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.900]   and he's gonna discern, that's the field of sin.
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.420]   He's gonna discern, that's the field of a slugger.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.660]   It's the vineyard of a guy who's got no sense.
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.780]   Now watch what happens.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.020]   As he walks by, this is what he's gonna tell you.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.300]   He says, it's a field, and that field,
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.980]   which is supposed to be a source of life
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.180]   and produce and prosperity, it's overgrown with thistles,
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.700]   and it's covered with nettles or with weeds.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.540]   And then it says this, right?
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.060]   It says the walls are broken down.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.380]   Now why do you have walls around a vineyard?
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.620]   You do it to keep predators out,
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.740]   boxes that'll come in and rip off fruit around the tree,
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.780]   but what kind of wall is it?
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.100]   Do you remember, right?
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:23.940]   What kind of wall is it?
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.020]   Look at your Bible if you've got it.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.380]   In Proverbs chapter 24, okay,
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.900]   it says right there in verse 31, it's a stone wall.
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.660]   Now how long does it take for a stone wall to fall down?
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.420]   This isn't a wicked fence that's just leaned up.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.780]   This is a stone wall.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.980]   So this is something that has been neglected
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.220]   for a long, long time.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.480]   And so what he's gonna say right here
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.220]   is this, he's gonna say, "So when I saw,
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.540]   "I reflected upon it, I looked."
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.820]   And these words, just talk about,
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.240]   "I glanced at it, but then I stopped,
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.540]   "and then I just stood there."
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.660]   And what he was gonna be was a student
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.260]   of somebody else's life and the fruit of it.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.500]   You guys ever done this?
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.660]   Are you looking at anybody's life,
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.760]   and you're kinda going, "Okay, man,
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:10.860]   "I don't really know what I wanna do,
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.420]   "but I don't think I want it to go that way."
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.500]   And vice versa, have you gone,
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.680]   "Hey, man, look, it looks like there's something there
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.740]   "worth following.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.960]   "It looks like there's life indeed there.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.860]   "I might wanna be a student of that."
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.940]   But it would be wise, if you see a person's life
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.460]   that has thorns and thistles and nestles
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.340]   and is not protected from every whim and fancy
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.780]   and every enemy that comes marauding along,
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.680]   then you might wanna go, "Hmm, I gotta learn from that."
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.700]   This is what he says.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.480]   He says, "As I walked," he goes, "I saw this,
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.720]   "a little sleep, a little slumber,
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.320]   "a little folding of the hands to rest."
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.940]   Now, that's backwards, isn't it?
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.420]   Right, when you go laying down, you don't go sleeping,
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.940]   then you slumber, and then you rest.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.180]   You usually go, "I think I'll just sit down here,
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.380]   "I'll fold my hands."
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.680]   And then you kinda go, "Oh, yeah,
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.580]   "I'll just lean back on the slumber for a little bit,"
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.500]   and then you move to a sleep.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.640]   That's the way you would think it would be,
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.280]   but that's not what it says in this proverb, right?
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.260]   So you wanna observe this.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.780]   What's he saying there?
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.380]   When he says, "A little sleep, a little slumber,"
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.460]   and then, just a little folding of the hands to rest,
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.600]   and you got trouble.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.220]   Well, what kind of trouble?
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.160]   It tells you, poverty, and it comes like a robber.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.220]   So what's a robber do?
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.560]   You make yourself just a simple observation.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.700]   Well, robbers, when they come,
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.620]   they don't usually pick up the phone and go,
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.000]   "Hey, I don't know what you're doing tonight.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.840]   "You're going to the porch, go.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.160]   "What time you taking off?"
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.400]   Good, and you'll get home around what time?
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.020]   Awesome, I'm gonna drop by around 7.45, 8.15,
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.140]   clean your house out, take your goods,
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:39.980]   and then be out of there.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.020]   Robbers don't do that.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.360]   They come when they're not expected,
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.740]   and you're devastated.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.480]   And how about an armed man?
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.840]   How's an armed man come?
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.360]   An armed man doesn't negotiate with you, right?
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.840]   He'll show up right to your face,
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.380]   and you're powerless and defenseless.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.000]   You have no ability to prevent
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.920]   what's about to happen from happening.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.680]   And so that life you always wanted, you don't get it.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.420]   Why?
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.300]   Because a little sleep, and then a little slumber,
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.080]   and a little folding of the hand of the rest,
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.260]   and you are completely exposed.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.440]   Proverbs 29.1 says this.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.680]   Proverbs 29.1 says, "He who hardens his neck
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.320]   "after much reproof will suddenly be broken beyond remedy."
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.320]   Some of you guys have experienced that,
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:37.000]   and some of you are just a little
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.080]   folding of the hands away from it.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.940]   I mean, you're on the brink.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.040]   How'd you get there?
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.140]   You got there because for a long time,
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.020]   you have been naive, you haven't been prudent,
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.420]   you haven't been paying attention,
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.600]   you have been sowing into your life
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.520]   disobedience and flippancy and arrogance.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.220]   And here's the deal, you've been kinda getting away with it.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.580]   And so you think you're gonna keep getting away with it.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.180]   But what happens, I can remember,
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.400]   when I was in college, one of my favorite classes
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.640]   was Constitutional Law, I was headed to law school,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.960]   and so I took Con Law, and it was a great class
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.840]   because unlike most classes, Con Law had no midterms,
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.540]   no papers, and no tests.
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.480]   I loved Con Law in September.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.220]   It was the best class I had all of October.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:36.300]   I didn't have to jack with Con Law a bit in November.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.200]   And I slept through it.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.080]   I put it aside while I did other things
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.220]   that were more pressing, but then all of a sudden,
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.840]   Thanksgiving was over, and I was two weeks away
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.360]   from one exam that was my entire semester.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.960]   And there had been sleep, and there had been slumber,
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.640]   and now I couldn't do anything but Con Law.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.120]   If I so much as folded my hands, I was done.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.620]   No law school, no heading that direction.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.380]   You see what happens there?
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.740]   A little sleep, a little slumber,
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.900]   and you've lost all flexibility, man.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.900]   You're on the brink.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:20.140]   'Cause the smallest variance from perfection
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.720]   is gonna cost you significantly.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.520]   And what he's saying is, I don't wanna do that.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.020]   I don't want that to be my story, right?
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.940]   And so here's just a simple observation.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.140]   I've already given you one, which is that
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.460]   experience as a good teacher, it's often
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.300]   a very expensive one.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.100]   Here's just another observation I made
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.500]   when I was just looking at this little proverb,
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.660]   and it's just simply this, and that is that
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.020]   a lot of damage can be done a little at a time.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.340]   A lot of damage can be done just a little bit at a time,
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.020]   and then all of a sudden, these little decisions
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.420]   all add up, and they reap big discretion.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.160]   Big, excuse me, big destruction, big problems.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.980]   I say to people all the time, when they think
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.380]   they've gotten something for nothing,
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.780]   I go, you haven't gotten something for nothing,
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.980]   you just haven't gotten the bill yet.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.420]   Right, it's like the guy, and a lot of you guys
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.500]   have done this, this is again, part of the deceitfulness
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.220]   of sin is that sometimes we do things
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.720]   and we kinda get away with it,
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.980]   and so we become a little more bolder in it,
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.420]   and we kinda go, we got away with it?
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.580]   And so we do it again, and we got away with it?
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.980]   But all of a sudden, we're developing a pattern,
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.340]   and that a broken, impoverished life
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.100]   is gonna come like a robber when we never expected it.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.620]   A couple of truths, this is Ecclesiastes chapter eight,
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.020]   verse 11, this is what the Bible says,
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.740]   the Bible just loves you, and so the Bible's
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.500]   gonna tell you the truth, and that's this,
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.700]   because the sentence against an evil deed
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.220]   is not executed quickly, in other words,
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.380]   because God doesn't strike you with a lightning bolt
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.860]   the first time he cuts, because you don't necessarily
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.060]   get pregnant the first time you cross lines,
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:56.020]   you get a little bolder in your sin.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.820]   Because the sentence against an evil deed
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.000]   is not executed quickly, therefore, this is what happens,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.540]   the hearts of the sons of men among them
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.980]   are given fully to do evil, and so here's the thing,
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.820]   I just will tell you this all the time,
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.900]   because I love you, I mean, you sow a thought,
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.980]   and that little thought will eventually reap an action.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:22.700]   That action that you sow will eventually reap a habit.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:28.020]   That habit that you sow eventually reaps a character,
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.220]   and that character that you now have
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.960]   will eventually be your destiny.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:39.980]   This is what is called the law of the harvest,
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.400]   and the Bible talks about it in Galatians chapter six,
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.860]   this is what it says, do not be deceived.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.600]   God's not mocked, man, a man will sow,
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.240]   and he will also reap, and so you wanna be
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.720]   really, really careful with what you're doing,
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.160]   the law of the harvest, right, we say this,
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.480]   I think here a lot, because it's so important,
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.960]   because this right now is sowing season in your life,
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.920]   and what happens a lot of times in our 20s,
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.680]   we think, well, I can plant whatever I want,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.600]   it's not gonna really cause me a lot of problems,
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.380]   and we're telling you, no, it is, it is,
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.860]   we're telling folks all the time, this is true,
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.980]   you're not gonna have married problems,
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.880]   you're gonna have single people problems
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.080]   that you drag into your future relationship.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.440]   And so you might as well learn right now
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.720]   to live in a way that's gonna make
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.720]   the relationship you dream about work.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.820]   The law of the harvest is this, you reap what you sow,
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.600]   you put a tomato seed in the ground,
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.120]   you're gonna get tomatoes, so you reap what you sow.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.160]   Secondly, you reap it later than you sow it,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.200]   you put a tomato seed in the ground,
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.240]   you don't get a tomato tomorrow, you don't get it next week.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.740]   But eventually, you're gonna get tomato stalk,
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.060]   tomato plant, and then you're not gonna get what?
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.140]   When you reap what you sow, you reap it later
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.500]   than you sow it, and you reap more than you sow.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.860]   This is the law of the harvest.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.260]   The return in your investment's always there.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.540]   So one tomato seed, does it give you one tomato?
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.860]   No, it gives you a tomato plant,
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.100]   which gives you multiple tomatoes.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.540]   That's the law of the harvest.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.020]   And so a lot of trouble comes a little at a time.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.640]   Now, the inverse is also true,
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.620]   that when you sow things in your life,
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.340]   it's gonna produce good things,
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.260]   and what this guy is saying is he's walking
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.980]   by the field of the slugger,
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.140]   and by the vineyard of the man lacking sense,
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.220]   and he's going, I'm gonna observe, I'm gonna look,
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.300]   I'm gonna reflect, I'm gonna study,
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.240]   I'm gonna make a decision.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.020]   I don't want my field to look like that.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.060]   Do you guys do that often?
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.060]   So here's what's so amazing, right?
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.060]   They don't usually show you the backstory
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.140]   in movies and love scenes.
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.240]   They don't show you the guilt and the sexual disease.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.820]   They don't show you the unwanted pregnancy.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.660]   They don't show you the tears.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.140]   I mean, go watch "Juno."
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.440]   Go watch "Fatal Attraction."
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.460]   That's the truth about affairs,
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.180]   but those movies, you can make one of those
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.980]   and get away with it, but it's just,
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.740]   it's like, it's not what really typically sells.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.480]   It's like, man, what happened to that one love scene
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.540]   on the elevator that turned into just horror?
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.620]   And see, here's the thing.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.780]   God's not mad at you.
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.540]   He just wants to rescue you.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.380]   He's kind to you, and so he's saying,
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.660]   listen, learn from fools.
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.460]   Wise men learn from their mistakes,
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.060]   but wiser men still learn from mistakes of others.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.260]   A lot of damage can be done a little at a time,
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.060]   and this is just true.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.200]   You know, until it hurts more to stay the same,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.700]   until it hurts to change, most people never change,
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.860]   and so I tell a lot of people this.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.460]   Man, if you like what you got, keep doing what you're doing,
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.300]   but I'm just gonna tell you,
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.140]   if you keep doing what you're doing,
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.380]   you're not gonna like what you got
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.480]   because while you're over there working in your field
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.940]   and doing the right thing, that slugger is over there
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.940]   playing Xbox, watching "Game of Thrones,"
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.740]   throwing a kegger, and it's not a problem
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.580]   the first day he does it, the second day he does it,
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.420]   the third day he does it,
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.500]   other than he's developing a pattern,
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.820]   an action that's gonna turn into a habit,
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.580]   that's gonna turn into a character,
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.540]   that's gonna turn into a destiny,
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:10.120]   and so you just keep doing what you should do.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.220]   I love the story, like, you know, this is the deal.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.740]   Some people have jumped off like a 100-story building,
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.420]   right, and they're mocking people
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.980]   that believe in the law of gravity
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.820]   because like when you first jump off a 100-story building,
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.220]   it's like a major adrenaline rush, it's a lot of fun.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.340]   You're like, wow, this is awesome, who needs elevators?
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:28.140]   This is incredible, I've never felt this free before,
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.060]   but sooner or later, the reality of your experience
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.420]   is gonna catch up with you,
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.520]   and I think sometimes you see people free-falling, man.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.060]   They show you a lot of the free-falling,
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.500]   the fun, the joy, the adrenaline rush,
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.400]   but it still shows you the splat a lot,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:48.020]   and what you need to do is you need to walk by splats.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.500]   And go, how'd that guy get here?
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.580]   I don't want my life to end up like that.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.300]   Some of you guys are in this room tonight,
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.380]   and you're saying, man, how did I get here?
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:07.100]   When I was out with my kids when they were younger a lot,
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.780]   man, whenever we had a chance to engage people
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.900]   that were on the streets, and we just never gave 'em
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.180]   something to make ourselves feel good,
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.020]   but what we would do is we would engage 'em relationally,
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.980]   and I would just sit there and say, man, tell me your name.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:16.900]   You're a person.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.180]   You got a story.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.180]   I'd introduce myself.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.900]   I'd introduce my child, and I'd say,
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.740]   can you do me a favor, man?
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.660]   Just tell me how you got here,
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.460]   and they said the same thing every time.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.380]   You know what everybody, everybody I've ever sat with
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.480]   on the street has told me?
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.460]   You know how I got here?
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.440]   I got here one bad decision at a time,
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:39.460]   and then another bad decision, and then another bad decision,
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.940]   and another bad decision, and here I am.
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.580]   So there's a way out.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.420]   We offer it to 'em.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.780]   We offer to get involved in their life
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.700]   and not just give them a little band-aid,
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.260]   but to really say, man, if you're sick and tired
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.960]   of being sick and tired, let's go.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.180]   Does it hurt more to stay the same than it does to change,
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.780]   and sadly, there's so many people in Dallas who mean well,
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.780]   that'll offer a handout that really isn't a handout.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.700]   It's holding 'em down because it's enabling them
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.500]   in a lifestyle that's not good for them
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.020]   that a lot of 'em go, man, this is working for me.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.820]   I'm making 80 bucks a day working two hours
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:13.940]   just hitting the streets.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.820]   That's enough, and we're stringing 'em out,
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.700]   but a lot of damage can be done in a little time.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.100]   I learned that from Proverbs 24, 30 through 34.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.520]   Experience is a good teacher.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.780]   It's often a very expensive one.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.780]   I learned that from Proverbs 20, verses 30 through 34
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.780]   'cause I could be a sluggard.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.560]   I could let my vineyard be overgrown
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.860]   with thistles and thorns.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.980]   Here's another one, man.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.840]   Your soul, your soul is like a field.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.480]   I thought, you know, this is not about a vineyard.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.720]   God's trying to teach me something here.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.360]   My soul is a field, and I ought to pay attention to it
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.640]   because this is gonna lead, the way I lead my life
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.800]   is gonna lead to prosperity.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.920]   It's gonna lead to blessing.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.420]   It's gonna lead to, in a sense, more joy,
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.320]   or I'm gonna have myself more pain,
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.400]   and so one of my favorite verses, it's just true,
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.640]   in Proverbs, it's Proverbs 10, verse 22,
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.640]   which says, "It's the blessing of the Lord
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:15.080]   "which makes rich, and he adds no sorrow to it."
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.760]   I've got one of my kids, who now is your age,
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.640]   she's 24 years old, and she just said,
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.640]   "Dad, can I just tell you something?
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.120]   "Because by the grace of God, you told me
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.020]   "what was gonna happen if I lived the life of a sluggard.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.840]   "If you helped me see what was true about God,
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.600]   "and I came to know him at an early age."
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.020]   She said, "Dad, this is the story of my life.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.560]   "I've got more joy and less scars."
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.320]   And that's her testimony.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.480]   I mean, some of you guys in this room,
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.120]   that's also your testimony, it's amazing.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.120]   Don't ever think that because you don't have
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.600]   some dramatic story, that you didn't show up at the porch,
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.640]   smelling like smoke hung over in the back,
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.280]   that you can't be used of God,
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.360]   because the most powerful testimony that God can give you
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.240]   is that early, God showed you his kindness,
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.280]   and you've got more joy and less scars.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.600]   Man, that is a testimony, that all your days,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.440]   God has walked with you.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.980]   It's largely David's testimony,
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.980]   and he's worth following.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:12.040]   But here's the other thing, if you have got scars,
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.760]   if your field is overthrown with thistles,
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.680]   if your stone walls are broken down,
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.240]   God's just saying, "Hey, you sick and tired
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.220]   "of being sick and tired?
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.040]   "Then come on, let me rebuild those things."
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.600]   There's grace here.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.960]   The only power you have over the past
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.400]   is purity in the present.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.360]   And let's get busy.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.360]   But your soul is a field, pay attention to it.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   This is what comes after that verse in Galatians 6,
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.200]   we just read.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.960]   This is Galatians 6, eight through nine.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.000]   It says, "For the one who sows to his own flesh,"
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.600]   in other words, who does what his flesh wants to do.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.220]   Our flesh is a part of this world,
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.980]   and this world is broken.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.840]   The world is broken because this world,
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.680]   and everybody in it, and the prince of this world,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.720]   the enemy, is a liar, and we have given ourself over to him,
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.840]   and so we are descendants of broken people.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.760]   Therefore, our flesh longs to do what it wants to do,
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.120]   and doesn't care what God says and who God is.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.560]   That's the nature of man.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.840]   All of us, in and of our nature,
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.980]   go, "I wanna do what I wanna do."
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.600]   But God, in his kindness, says,
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.160]   "That's not gonna work out well for you,
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.360]   "and anybody who doesn't like the family
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.200]   "you were born into, I will rescue you."
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.060]   Did you hear that?
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.960]   Even you people who were born into a family
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.720]   where somebody like me is gonna teach you
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.320]   that it's the blessing of the Lord that makes rich,
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.360]   and he has no sorrow to it, you gotta make a decision,
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.560]   because you're still a son of Adam and a daughter of Eve,
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.480]   and so your flesh is gonna go,
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.840]   "I don't know if I wanna listen to my old man.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.080]   "I don't know if I wanna listen to wisdom.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.960]   "I think I like my own knowledge."
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.360]   And there's a way that seems right to you,
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.080]   it's gonna lead to death, and you can either learn
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.680]   it leads to death through your own choices
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.440]   and your own experiences, or you can go and look
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.060]   at people who already rebelled against God,
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.680]   and walk by their splat, and go,
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.860]   "I think I will take the vineyard
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.680]   "of the man that was diligent."
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:55.840]   And sowed in the spring, and reaped in the harvest,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.760]   and planted the right things,
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.120]   and built up walls of protection,
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   and followed a wise father who called them to work
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.920]   and not be lazy and give themselves over to their flesh.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   See, Proverbs is just a loving father trying to help you,
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.240]   and we all need to learn.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.080]   We all need to learn.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.400]   There's a guy named John Wesley who was a great leader
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.960]   and a godly man, and he studied, he disciplined himself
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.040]   to learn as much as he could,
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.480]   and somebody wrote him a letter one time,
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.960]   and said, "The Lord told me to tell you
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.280]   "that he doesn't need all of your learning."
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.920]   And so Wesley got that letter, and he wrote back, okay,
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.120]   and he said this.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.980]   He goes, "Thank you, sir.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.960]   "I got your letter, though it was superfluous,"
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.480]   meaning it was unnecessary.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.220]   "I know the Lord doesn't need my learning,
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:42.040]   "but I wanna let you know,
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.540]   "the Lord has not told me to say this.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.500]   "I say this on my own responsibility.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.840]   "The Lord doesn't need your ignorance either."
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.720]   That's a fact.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:55.040]   But you need to learn.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.480]   See, the glory of young men, this is another proverb,
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   Proverbs 20, verse 29 says,
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.000]   "The glory of young men is their strength."
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.440]   And when you're strong, you can kinda jump off
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.000]   taller things than you should and kinda bounce back.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.080]   And the glory of young men is their strength.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.400]   The glory of young women is their strength.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.040]   But the glory of old men, it says, is their gray hair,
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.720]   which I'm increasingly seeing is mine.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:24.680]   But it means I haven't ruined my life,
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.220]   that I'm around to have hair that turns gray.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.900]   And I've lived a life that has largely been defined
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.340]   by wisdom, and underneath that graying hair
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.580]   is a life that has more joy and less scars.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.420]   And the Lord is my strength,
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.880]   that has kept me from ruining my vineyard.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.260]   And your soul is a field.
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.120]   And right now, you see, you gotta have the strength
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.780]   of early spring, and so you just can be a little lazy
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.180]   and it doesn't look like it's a problem,
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.500]   but let me just tell you something.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.340]   It's a problem.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.060]   Those exercise habits, those eating habits,
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.720]   those dating habits, those thinking habits,
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.680]   sow a thought, reap an action.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.700]   Sow an action, reap a habit.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.580]   Sow a habit, reap a character.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.060]   Sow a character, reap a destiny.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:19.060]   And you don't want thorns, thistles, and broken walls.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.660]   I was speaking at a deal in Laguna Beach,
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:26.360]   which is not a bad place to say yes to speak, last week.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.700]   And I was there, and one of the guys that I was dealing with,
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.340]   I'm gonna call him Ken, it wasn't his name,
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.800]   but Ken and I got in a conversation.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.540]   He was there, he just got a new job,
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.140]   and I just go, man, Ken, tell me what's going on.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.320]   And so he and I were just interacting while I was there.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.420]   He was actually serving me and taking care of me.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.860]   And I said, hey, Ken, let me ask you a question, man.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.340]   So as we talked a little bit more,
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.060]   and man, this guy, you could tell, he was just,
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.620]   he was flying high, he had made a lot of money
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.140]   in the oil fields, and now he was out in California,
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.660]   and he was doing well, he was living in Laguna,
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.180]   had a new job on the beach, and I go,
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.960]   so man, tell me about your belief, what do you believe?
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.120]   You have a faith?
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.680]   And he said, well, he goes, I'm spiritual.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.920]   I love being in the ocean, man.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.320]   When I'm in the ocean, I'm one with God, right?
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.080]   When I'm walking out there in nature, I just feel good.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.440]   My girlfriend and I were in love,
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.560]   and I just say, hey, Ken, here's the deal, bro.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.880]   You do know that that's not the way it's always gonna be.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.600]   Sometimes that ocean swells up,
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.200]   sometimes there's an undertow that sucks you out,
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.980]   sometimes there's sharks in there that eat you,
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.600]   sometimes you get old and you can't swim.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.720]   That girlfriend you're sleeping with
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.960]   where everything's going well,
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.480]   sometimes that doesn't lead, you do know
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.720]   that it's not always your first two weeks in California
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.840]   where you're spending your money
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.800]   sleeping with your girlfriend, hanging out in the ocean.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.480]   You do know things are gonna change.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.440]   What are you gonna do with your spiritual joy then?
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.520]   What are you gonna do when some of this behavior
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.840]   is no longer bringing the blessing that it is now?
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.520]   And he was a really humble guy.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.280]   He didn't say, I'll deal with that when it happens.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.560]   It just made him stop and think,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.360]   and I just said, let me just ask you a question.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.680]   Do you know the God that you say when you're in the ocean,
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.520]   you enjoy it, the God that made you made that ocean,
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.680]   he wants you to enjoy it.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.840]   You know the God that made that girl,
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.480]   he wants you to enjoy her.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.880]   You know the God that made you right now
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.280]   at this age and young, he wants you to enjoy it.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.240]   But I'm gonna tell you that right now,
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.840]   the way you're running your life
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.040]   is not gonna lead to the life that you want.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.480]   And so I'm just gonna ask you to start thinking
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.700]   about what you're sowing into your life
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.040]   because here's what you need to know.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.960]   Even if it never turns you on in this life,
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   it's appointed for men to die once
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.160]   and after this comes judgment.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.000]   What's your plan when judgment comes?
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.680]   And then I just said, has anybody ever told you
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.240]   what the central message of the scripture is?
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.440]   Because God's not just here to give you your best life now,
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.520]   God is here to rescue you from a life
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.420]   that doesn't wanna deal with tomorrow.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.040]   He doesn't want stone walls to start to crumble
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.760]   and he doesn't want thistles to grow and metals to inhabit.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.960]   He wants blessing for you.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.280]   But to do that, you gotta be connected to him
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.640]   and sin keeps you from him.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.920]   And so I just asked him, has anybody ever told you
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.120]   what the central message of the Bible is?
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.820]   He didn't have any clue.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.400]   Kind of threw out some churchy ideas
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.040]   that God wants this, God wants that,
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:54.880]   and I just asked him, I said,
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.440]   can I just tell you what God wants?
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.600]   And I told him a story.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.760]   That God loves the daughters of Eve and the sons of Adam.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.440]   He's not mad at them.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.600]   And there's a way that seems right to them,
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.640]   but it leads to death.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.880]   And it doesn't lead to it right away,
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.860]   which is what makes the wrong way seem so deceptive.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.400]   But God wants you to have a way back.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.960]   He wants that relationship with that girl to work.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.000]   He wants that ocean in you,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.160]   not to be something you worship,
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.600]   but something that you enjoy.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.820]   Your soul is a field, pay attention to it.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:31.160]   Eventually, gang, who you are in private
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.400]   will always show up and affect the way
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.800]   that you are seen in public.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:39.600]   It always happens that way.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:45.060]   As I read this, I just learned for myself,
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.920]   not only that experience is a good teacher,
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.440]   that a lot of damage can be done in a little time,
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.880]   that my soul is like a field
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.880]   and I gotta pay attention to it and walk around,
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.520]   and I gotta not sow to my flesh,
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.760]   because when I sow to my flesh, I reap corruption,
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.320]   but the one who sows to the spirit will reap life indeed.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.840]   I also learned this, that procrastination today
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.640]   will result in unsolicited, unwanted, unexpected,
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.000]   and often unavoidable consequences.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.640]   That's that little piece I already told you, right?
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.400]   Your poverty will come like a robber
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.680]   and your want like an arm man.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.640]   Have you ever been there where you're just defenseless
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.360]   against this life and you always do this?
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.520]   You go, how did I get here?
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.560]   How did I get here?
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.400]   And this is it, this is Proverbs chapter 19,
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.480]   verses two and three.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.760]   It says this, it's not good for a man or a woman
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.080]   to be without knowledge.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:29.160]   The foolishness, and it says,
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.040]   he who makes haste with his feet errs, okay?
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.880]   In other words, the one who just hurries his footsteps
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.480]   a certain direction, you're gonna make mistakes.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.760]   You gotta stop and you gotta think.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.600]   Listen to what happens though when you make mistakes.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.960]   Verse three, the foolishness of man subverts
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.920]   or ruins his way, and then what do we all do, right?
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.880]   You ever been here?
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.560]   When you just haven't done what you know you should do,
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.600]   you haven't done what God says is the way to life.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.160]   God, how could this happen to me?
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.280]   How did I get here?
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.720]   And then we usually start cutting deals with God.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.400]   God, get me out of this this one time,
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.160]   and I swear I'll never do it again.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:08.200]   God is gracious, right?
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.560]   God is gracious.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.960]   He doesn't erase always the consequences,
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.760]   but he lets you stop the life of destruction
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.080]   when you start to look to him.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.360]   But procrastination is not the path, you know,
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.440]   towards prosperity.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.000]   Someday, when you say that, someday I'm gonna change.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.400]   Someday is not a day of the week.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.360]   It never gets here.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.920]   Have you noticed that?
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.960]   Can I just tell you something?
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.280]   The devil doesn't care how much you pray.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.360]   The devil doesn't care how much you study your Bible.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.960]   The devil doesn't care how much you choose to love God
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.700]   and follow him as long as you don't do it today.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.040]   He loves when you say, I'm gonna get serious
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:45.880]   with God one day.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.640]   I'm gonna do my work and really one day
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.000]   figure out if God is good.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.480]   I'm gonna one day, I'm gonna read my Bible.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.920]   One day, one day my relationships are gonna be different.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.640]   One day, I'm not gonna give myself away
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.560]   'cause it seems right to me.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.700]   He loves when you talk like that.
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:01.640]   But the truth is that today is the father of tomorrow.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.720]   Tomorrow is the road to despair.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.160]   The Bible says today is the day of salvation.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.120]   When you keep putting it off,
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.880]   I mean, procrastination is the devil's Prozac.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.560]   It makes you feel better,
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.960]   that eventually you'll feel better.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:26.640]   But the Scripture just exhorts us to be about it.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.800]   So many of us say, man, I'd love,
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.320]   I'd give anything to have a life like that.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.120]   What we mean is I'd love to be able to do whatever I want
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.680]   and wake up tomorrow and my life has a field
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.560]   that's overgrown with prosperity, that's secure,
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.040]   and that is wrapped around strength and dignity
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.840]   as my clothing, nobility and wholeness
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.440]   and purity and strength and kindness.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.720]   And that's not how you get that life,
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.760]   by just wanting it.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.840]   I think the last time I was with you guys,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.400]   I gave you this little syllogism, right?
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.480]   And I think I might've said it wrong,
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.560]   but here's three questions I love to ask people.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.120]   I'll do it again, let's see if I can get it right this time.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.720]   And it's that, hey, do you want a life filled with blessing?
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.140]   Do you want a life that would be defined as,
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.040]   that's a godly life, that's a rich life,
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.200]   that's a life that is gonna have prosperity
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   and not just in terms of wealth and health,
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.640]   'cause you may not be wealthy and healthy,
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.000]   you might have cancer and die,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.480]   but have you ever seen people with cancer
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.760]   that have joy and still sing?
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.520]   You ever seen people that are single,
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.620]   deep into their 40s, that have more security
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.640]   than a woman who's been in and out
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.080]   of relationships continually?
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:30.920]   Do you want to be a godly man?
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.000]   Do you want to be a godly woman, yes or no?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.320]   Ask yourself that question.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.640]   Okay?
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.760]   And now here's the second question.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.720]   Does God want you to be a godly man or a woman?
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.880]   Does God want you to be a godly man or a woman?
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.960]   And we think, I think so, because God loves me,
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.600]   and when I'm a godly man, it's a life that leads to
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.240]   a blessing, and he has no sorrow to it.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.040]   Then here's the third question.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.360]   Are you a godly man, and are you a godly woman?
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.760]   And I'm gonna tell you,
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.120]   if you answer that third question, no,
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.680]   and you answer the first question, yes,
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.800]   you lied to yourself on the very first question.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.200]   You lied to yourself on the very first question.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.680]   Because God wants you to be a godly man or a godly woman,
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.280]   and you would be a godly man or a godly woman
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.340]   if you wanted to be.
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:20.920]   And the reason you're not is because you're hiding
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.560]   behind that lie, that yet tomorrow,
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.880]   I think I'm gonna do the things that will make my life
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.520]   the life that is reconciled with God,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.960]   forgiven for my sin because of what Jesus has done,
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.400]   and any God that would reconcile to me, to him,
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.200]   and pull me out of judgment and take me out of death
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.320]   and into life is a God worth following and knowing,
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.320]   and now dignity and honor and strength and nobility
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.720]   will be my clothing, and I will not live a life
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.480]   of malice and hatred and hateful envy.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.080]   I will, by the grace of God, sow into my life
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.200]   the things of the Spirit, and goodness and gentleness
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.200]   and faithfulness and self-control will be the fruit of that.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.520]   Do you wanna be a godly man or woman?
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.660]   Because you can be.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.420]   This is Proverbs 13, four.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.440]   The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.800]   See, the sluggard doesn't want a field
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.360]   that has walls that are broken down
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.320]   and thistles that cover it and nestles that are everywhere.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.200]   The sluggard wants to eat.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.840]   The sluggard wants a good life,
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.720]   but he doesn't do what he needs to do to get it.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.240]   He doesn't walk with God and follow the law of the harvest.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.560]   But the soul of the diligent,
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.040]   that's the soul that is made fat.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.760]   And Jesus says, "Come, come.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.640]   "Are you hungry?
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.320]   "If anyone hears my voice,
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.080]   (knocking)
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.680]   "knocks on the door, I will open the door
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.280]   "and he will come in with me and dine with me."
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.480]   But you gotta knock, you gotta say,
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.360]   "Hey, I'm sick of living outside the counsel of God.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.140]   "I'm sick of living apart from you, God,
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.120]   "the one who cares for me and blesses me."
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:52.840]   So here's what you need to do.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.660]   We're just gonna end with this.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:54.500]   Here's a statement.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:55.320]   I want you to take it just a second.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.480]   This is what you do when you read your Bible.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.760]   I just made some observations.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.740]   You can do that.
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.240]   Stop and go, "What's that there for?
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.080]   "What can I learn?
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.360]   "I can learn that I can learn from other people.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.680]   "I don't want that life.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.020]   "I see that his life got that way a little at a time.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:07.860]   "You know what?
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.800]   "My soul is a lot like that guy's vineyard.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.760]   "Experience, I could learn that that's a bad life
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.320]   "by doing it myself or I could learn from his life."
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.120]   And so here's what I want you to do
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.240]   before you shut your Bible tonight.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.460]   I just want you to answer this question.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.680]   To avoid potential ruin,
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.600]   well, maybe further ruin,
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.440]   to avoid potential or further ruin in my vineyard,
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.720]   the vineyard that is my life,
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.800]   today,
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.600]   I will.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.360]   Today, I will.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.680]   And plug it in, today.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.240]   Not tomorrow, not next week.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.960]   Not next week where I go up front and say,
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.800]   "Man, would you help me?
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.000]   "Would you stop me to put this life together?
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.960]   "Because I think I've made one decision, another decision,
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:51.360]   "and I'm not far from poverty and soul despair
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.060]   "and anxiety ruling my life like a robber.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.320]   "I don't even know how I got here.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.180]   "And I'm angry at God,
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.000]   "but I find out that maybe it's not God's fault.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.080]   "Maybe it's because I just lived the life of a sluggard
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.160]   "and did what I wanted to do
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.220]   "instead of living a diligent life of discipline.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.840]   "And I don't want that to be my destiny."
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.440]   And you're gonna find a lot of grace here, man,
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.920]   because a lot of us, we didn't grow up,
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.880]   a lot of us didn't grow up in homes
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.720]   with dads who taught us about the goodness of God.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.840]   And we had to be reparented, and we had to be rescued.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.480]   Somebody had to show me who God was,
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.160]   and I had to see the wonders of grace,
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.580]   and I had to move towards him and be rescued.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.840]   And so I'm just one beggar telling another beggar
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.080]   where to find bread, and I'm saying, "Let's go."
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.800]   The only power we have over our past
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.720]   is purity in the presence.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.240]   There's a cross that will deliver us from judgment,
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.320]   and then there's a king that will lead us in the way.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.680]   And I say to you, "Come."
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:45.240]   In order to prevent or avoid potential or further ruin
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.320]   in the vineyard that is my life, today I will.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.240]   I will at least go,
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.560]   "Hey, what's the central message of the Bible?
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.540]   "Who is Jesus?
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.520]   "What's the big deal about the resurrection?
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.260]   "What's this thing called community?
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.840]   "How do I study my Bible?
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.700]   "Is there a place I can learn to read it,
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:00.800]   "taught, and do what you did
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.660]   "in this little 30, 45 minutes we had together tonight?
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.340]   "I wanna learn to feed myself.
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.280]   "Can I do that?"
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.580]   Today I will.
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.700]   Step number one is just say,
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.560]   "God, I've avoided you
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.560]   "because I've made you to be something you're apparently not.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.420]   "You're a loving father.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:15.440]   "I didn't have a loving father.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.400]   "I put on you the attributes that I saw in my dad.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.420]   "I don't want the life that my dad created for me,
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.440]   "for my kids.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.040]   "So can you make me a man?
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.260]   "Can you make me a woman?
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.540]   "Can you teach me how to have relationships
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.460]   "that work?"
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:36.400]   Today's the day.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.860]   God loves you.
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.400]   That's why I love being with you,
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.500]   because I love when 20-year-olds run with Jesus,
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.820]   because you're gonna get to enjoy God for decades
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.960]   and be a source of grace to others.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:56.700]   God is a young man's God.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.560]   Psalm 23, one of our favorite psalms,
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.660]   "The Lord is my shepherd."
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:00.840]   When do we read that to most people?
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.120]   When does Psalm 23 get pulled out most of the time?
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.020]   What's the answer?
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.680]   Funerals, right?
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.840]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.160]   I shall not want.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.320]   Eventually, even though he leads me
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:11.940]   through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:12.800]   I fear no evil.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.640]   Let me just tell you something.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.800]   David did not write that song on his deathbed.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.080]   David wrote that song when he was younger than you,
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.280]   fighting the terrors of youth.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.360]   David wrote that psalm when he was in his late teens,
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.700]   early 20s, before he was a king,
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.980]   while he was still out in the fields just working,
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.140]   being left when the prophet came to anoint the new king.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.940]   His dad didn't even think enough about him to come,
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.140]   and David said, "I don't care.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.900]   "I'm where I'm supposed to be doing
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.700]   "what I'm supposed to be doing, and my God loves me,
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.480]   "and he will lead me to pleasant places,
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.640]   "and he will fill my cup, and I will not forsake him."
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.140]   Psalm 23 is a young person's psalm,
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:54.340]   and this is a young person's God.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.120]   Enjoy him now.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.040]   I promise you, there's nothing on lower Greenville
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.800]   that can offer you what God offers you,
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.460]   starting with grace and forgiveness and redemption.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:10.440]   I, when I was your age, met Jesus,
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.840]   and I am 30 years ahead of you, and I'm just telling you,
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.040]   it's the blessing of the Lord that makes rich,
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.320]   and he adds no sorrow to it.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.980]   I delight myself in the wife of my youth.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.120]   My kids and I have a great relationship.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.960]   My community largely thinks I'm a blessing,
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:31.460]   and I'm just telling you guys,
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:35.100]   I've gone through cancer, I've gone through despair,
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.400]   I've gone through dysfunctional family relationships
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.300]   with God, and he is good.
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:46.780]   The wisest men that ever lived
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:51.020]   wrapped up the one who wrote Proverbs,
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.680]   didn't live with understanding,
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.880]   lacked wisdom, and paid a deep price.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.580]   Solomon became this fool.
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:04.620]   And the last stroke of his pen was not Psalm 23,
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:06.160]   it was Ecclesiastes chapter 12,
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.460]   and this is what he says, verse one.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:11.140]   "Remember your creator in the days of your youth.
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.660]   "Don't be a fool like me.
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:15.400]   "Don't be the sluggard,
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.080]   "and don't let your vineyard be overgrown with thistles
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.540]   "and the stone wall of God's word be broken down.
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:25.080]   "Before the evil years come and the days draw near
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.480]   "when you say I have no delight in them,
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.780]   "because in verses two through 12,
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.280]   "he describes aging and graying hair
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.460]   "and teeth that fall out and ears that can't see
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:35.080]   "and eyes that grow dim and backs that are crooked
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.020]   "and feet that are weak and feeble
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.460]   "and legs that can't jump."
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:43.460]   No, you learn to love God when you're young
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.060]   and you can run with him and enjoy him in that ocean
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.340]   and with the wife of your youth
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.140]   so that you have decades together
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.580]   of blessing and prosperity.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:54.840]   Verse 13, "The conclusion when all has been heard
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.100]   "is fear God," which means just know
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.280]   you don't wanna miss a single part of his goodness to you.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.680]   "Keep his commandments," because this applies to every person
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.280]   "for God will bring every act of judgment,
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.140]   "everything which is hidden, whether it's good or evil."
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.160]   The life which you're living in private right now
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.620]   is going to be very quickly dragged
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.120]   into public relationships
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.780]   that you're gonna live for decades to come,
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.720]   and God loves you.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.700]   And so walk with me by the field of the sluggard.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:18.860]   And by the vineyard of those
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.320]   that aren't tending to their soul.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.760]   Maybe it's yours.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:25.160]   And so today's the day of salvation.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.700]   Come home to your king.
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.860]   Let him pull the weeds of sin
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:33.640]   and let him sow the spirit
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.400]   of fruit of righteousness in your life.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.880]   Father, I pray for my friends
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:44.620]   that they would just learn to love the wisdom
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:45.980]   and the truth that's in your word,
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:47.180]   the way your grace let me,
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.660]   so that they can begin to walk with you, first of all,
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.860]   that they can begin to throw themselves at you
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.460]   in their despair and their sin and their sowing rebellion,
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:55.600]   just like I did,
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.160]   and they can find forgiveness at the cross,
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.700]   just like I did.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:52:59.840]   And when seeing that you're a God
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.100]   that demonstrates his love for us,
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.500]   and while we're still sinners,
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.900]   that they could then go,
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.680]   "What kind of God is this that he would love me
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.880]   "and give his life for me?"
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.780]   That they would then begin to want to run with you
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.040]   and run to you and be around your people
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.920]   that will encourage them day after day
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:16.220]   so their life is not hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.460]   Lord, I pray that tonight in this room,
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:22.360]   and all across the internet that's listening,
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.060]   there will be people that just go, "Lord, thank you.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:25.860]   "I'm gonna be one of the wise that learns from fools,
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.300]   "maybe the fools of my own life,
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.460]   "and my heart's not gonna rage against you.
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.780]   "My heart, in its brokenness,
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.600]   "is gonna run to you and find forgiveness."
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.280]   And maybe for the folks that already know you,
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.540]   they're gonna run that much more.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.680]   And they're gonna say, "Father, thank you
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:40.520]   "that your desire for me to be a godly son of Adam
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.580]   "or a godly daughter of Eve
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:43.480]   "is always gonna be greater than my own desire.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.860]   "So, Lord, draw me to you.
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.420]   "Don't let me miss who you are.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.720]   "Let me trust in you.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:54.460]   "Let me know the blessing of your way
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:58.060]   "and take away the sorrow of my sluggard, rebellious soul.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:01.420]   "Be gracious to my friends.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.660]   "Show them who you are, Father.
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:06.740]   "In Jesus' name, amen."
