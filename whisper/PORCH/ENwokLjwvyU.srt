00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,760
 What's up, everybody in the room?

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,840
 Everybody tuning in.

4
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,040
 Hey, this is Crew and Monroe, who I talk about all the time.

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,520
 And Crew, this is one of his last weeks of summer.

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,800
 And he has never been to a porch.

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,720
 And so he wanted to come see it.

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,440
 So now--

 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,000
 Wait, what?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,440
 No, she hasn't.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,400
 Oh, she hasn't either.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,720
 Yeah, she has not been to another one either.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,480
 But hey, can you all say hi and bye?

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,400
 All right, now you're going to go with Ramsey.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,520
 And you've got to go home to mama,

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,800
 or I'm going to be in trouble.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,920
 So all right.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,680
 Hey, bye, y'all.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,600
 Walk with Ramsey.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,760
 Listen good.

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,120
 Don't tell mom about the cookies.

00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,200

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,720
 Yeah, love you.

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,760
 If you're joining us online or in the room,

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,200
 those are my kids who are here.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,760
 And I had an illustration that was going to open with Monroe.

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,960
 And JJ, our production director, was like,

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,600
 do you just want to bring them up there

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,640
 rather than do a picture?

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,960
 And my honest answer was, it depends on how long they last

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,320
 before the meltdown happens.

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,760
 And so if you saw my son running around the aisles, I apologize.

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,160
 I tried to tell him, we're not that kind of church.

35
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,120
 And he didn't quite get it.

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:52,880
 And so on June 29, 2018, my wife gave birth to our daughter.

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,360
 And we had had-- yeah, thank you.

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,880
 You just saw it.

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,720
 There's the proof.

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,600
 I'd had a son.

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,440
 And having a daughter is just such a different deal.

42
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,720
 And I would see that over time.

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,480
 I mean, she's the most girly girl, which I'm not saying

44
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,800
 everybody has to be, but just the most girly girl person

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,120
 I've ever met in my life.

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,160
 I mean, my son is constantly like, let's wrestle.

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,680
 Let's fight.

48
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,560
 Can we compete?

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,440
 And she is like, oh, let me hold the baby.

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,320
 Let me hold the baby.

51
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,680
 And having a newborn has only made her even more like,

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,680
 now I have a real live baby doll.

53
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,880
 And I mean, she wants to wear dresses all day long.

54
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,440
 And she changes outfits like 16 times a day, which is only

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,840
 like three less than her mom.

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,720
 And she-- I'm totally kidding.

57
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,600
 And I'm going to be in trouble for that later.

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,960
 But it just is a different thing.

59
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,120
 Because when you raise a son, you're kind of like, all right,

60
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,800
 man, there's a lot of dysfunction

61
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,240
 in the world caused by men.

62
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,920
 Together, we're going to get their son.

63
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,000
 You're trying to raise him and just teach him to be God's man

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,280
 and not just somebody that contributes

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
 to the chaos in the world around you.

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,920
 And then when you have a daughter, you're like, OK,

67
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,600
 now I have to protect you from all

68
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,280
 of the craziness and the crazy men in the world around you,

69
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,120
 which is a much more significant thing.

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,240
 It's one, you're just, hey, just don't contribute.

71
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,720
 And the other one is, oh, no.

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,400
 And I've just seen it play out.

73
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,200
 And raising her, I know there's going

74
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,600
 to be a lot of milestones in her life

75
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,560
 that will be significant ones.

76
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,120
 When she grows up and goes into middle school

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,240
 and is embarrassed of mom and dad or hits puberty,

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,920
 that one's going to be real interesting.

79
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,600
 Or when she can drive a car for the first time

80
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,760
 or when she goes on her first date

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
 or when she goes off to college, it's

82
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,960
 just these milestone moments in front of us.

83
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,720
 And another milestone will be how she interacts

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,960
 with the faith or does she become a believer.

85
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,800
 Hopefully, she does.

86
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,080
 We certainly pray that she does.

87
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,080
 But the question in tonight's wrap-up of FAQ

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,040
 that I want to answer will have a great deal with whether

89
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,680
 or not she does follow Christ.

90
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,680
 It's a question that has prevented a lot of people

91
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,000
 and confused a lot of people and discouraged a lot of people

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,240
 from following Christ.

93
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,280
 And it's the question of, is the Bible sexist?

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,040
 Is the Bible sexist?

95
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,160
 Like, is Christianity, is Jesus, does it

96
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,840
 have a preference over men?

97
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,200
 Is the message of the New Testament

98
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,320
 and of the Bible as a whole, is it sexist?

99
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,240
 And so that's what I want to walk through tonight.

100
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,640
 And let me say a couple of prefaces before we dive in.

101
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,800
 When it comes to exactly what exactly is sexist

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,840
 and what's not, there's some subjectivity to it.

103
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,680
 There's an opinion related to it.

104
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,000
 And certain things are just clearly

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,840
 showing a discrimination over someone's sex.

106
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,300
 And then there's other things where it just candidly isn't.

107
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,440
 In fact, in reading and preparing and studying,

108
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,920
 increasingly, there's a lot of division

109
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,080
 over even what is sexism.

110
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,720
 For example, if I said, hey, on the first date,

111
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,160
 he opened the door for you.

112
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,000
 Is that sexist or not?

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Now, we're in Texas, so most of us would say, no.

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,120
 That's not sexist.

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,880
 That's sweet.

116
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,400
 But there's a lot of people increasingly

117
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,360
 that would say, no, that's sexist.

118
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,960
 How dare you think that I can't open my own door?

119
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,000
 What's wrong with you?

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,960
 That's a thing.

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
 Even the idea of opening a door and holding it

122
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,160
 open for a woman, is that sexist or sweet?

123
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,280
 Many of us would say sweet, but there's people in the world

124
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,880
 that would say it's not.

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,640
 In other words, there's some subjectivity.

126
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,160
 In fact, even on paying for a first date, which I would

127
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,960
 highly encourage, if you're going to take her on a date,

128
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,400
 and you're going to take her time, you are paying.

129
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,600
 But even that is sweet as that.

130
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,720
 And if it needs to be said, I mean,

131
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,960
 you could look it up right now.

132
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,560
 Paying for the first date, is it sexist?

133
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,120
 You're going to hit lots and lots of Cosmopolitan magazine

134
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,040
 and different things pop up.

135
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,560
 So there's some subjectivity in regards to that.

136
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,200
 But I want to make the case that the person of Christ

137
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,760
 is the single most pro-woman person who has ever lived.

138
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,960
 And I also want to make a case that the Christian movement

139
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
 has been the single greatest force for human rights,

140
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,920
 period, but for women in general,

141
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,880
 and is the most pro-force for women that has ever existed.

142
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,440
 In order to do so, I've got to cover a lot of historical

143
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,920
 ground and bring a lot of us into a bigger perspective

144
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,840
 on why that is the case, and candidly,

145
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,520
 why you think the way that you do.

146
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,520
 But before I go there and bring up some historical

147
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,240
 and academic and research-based things, I want to say this.

148
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,360
 If you have been in a church context,

149
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,400
 I'm speaking specifically to the ladies,

150
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,360
 and you have felt discouraged, inferior,

151
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,440
 less than in any way, I am sorry.

152
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,240
 And that is not at all consistent

153
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,800
 with what we're going to see in Scripture.

154
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,440
 And we're going to walk through God's design

155
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
 and God's creation.

156
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,440
 And I know a lot of people maybe just listening

157
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,040
 down the road or listening online have felt that

158
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,880
 and experienced that.

159
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,600
 And if you've ever experienced anything like that for me,

160
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,520
 will you please forgive me?

161
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
 Because that is not God's heart.

162
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
 And His design is so incredible and beautiful,

163
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,360
 and His image is reflected.

164
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,840
 And I hope that tonight is a strengthening

165
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,360
 of God's amazing design in male and female.

166
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,560
 So I want to walk through four things.

167
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,600
 I want to walk through the world before sin,

168
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,160
 as God designed it.

169
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,280
 Then I want to walk through the world before Christ

170
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,600
 and the world of women before Christ.

171
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,120
 And then I want to walk through the world of women

172
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,480
 because of Christ and men.

173
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,960
 And then our world today without Christ.

174
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
 So first we're going to cover the world very quickly,

175
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,600
 the world before sin.

176
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,080
 So this is Genesis chapter one.

177
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,560
 If you take notes, the world before sin,

178
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,040
 God creates the world.

179
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,880
 And on the very first page of the Bible,

180
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,120
 He says, "Let us make mankind in our image."

181
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,280
 And it says this, Genesis chapter one,

182
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,520
 as in the first chapter, first page.

183
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,560
 "In the image of God, God created mankind."

184
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,480
 In the image of God, He created them.

185
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,720
 Male and female, He created them.

186
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,200
 One of the biggest lies in our world right now

187
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,080
 is that either men exclusively, uniquely,

188
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,560
 or even majorly reflect the image of God.

189
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,400
 That's not true.

190
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,640
 From page one, God said, "Male and female

191
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,520
 "have been created to reflect the image of God."

192
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,680
 And the masculine qualities,

193
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,000
 and even that has gotten so distorted.

194
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,960
 But inside of males and females,

195
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,440
 you see the image of God reflected in our world.

196
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,260
 And every person that is in this room

197
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,040
 or ever listens that has ever lived

198
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,040
 has eternal value, biblically speaking.

199
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,540
 Not because of how they look, where they work,

200
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,600
 where they were born, what they've done or haven't done,

201
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,080
 but because they have been made in the image of God.

202
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,520
 And nothing can take that away.

203
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,480
 Nothing can change that.

204
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,720
 And as Christians, because the Bible says that,

205
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,200
 we have a framework now to approach the conversation.

206
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,360
 In other words, a lot of people in life,

207
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
 without the Bible, without a compass,

208
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,580
 something that's informing how they think

209
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,300
 and how they believe and what is right and wrong,

210
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,560
 they're going off their opinion.

211
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,080
 And there's a lot of people inside of the world

212
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,460
 that are fighting for something based on their opinion.

213
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,480
 And as Christians, we have the strongest argument

214
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
 for, hey, here's why every person is worthy

215
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,840
 of being treated with respect and dignity and care,

216
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,640
 regardless of what they've done or haven't done

217
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,280
 or who they are, because they have been made

218
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,200
 in the image of God, unlike anything else in creation.

219
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,200
 They're a divine image bearer of such great value,

220
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,400
 Jesus would give his life on the cross for them.

221
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,080
 So that was God's design.

222
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,720
 And he created man in his image and he put him on earth.

223
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,000
 And that lasted about three minutes.

224
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,800
 And sin entered the world and everything got fractured.

225
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,280
 And all of a sudden, this working together relationship

226
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,280
 of male and female became riddled with division,

227
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,240
 animosity, hostility, a desire for one another's roles,

228
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,720
 a rejection of God, a fracture in relationships

229
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,900
 and the ability to keep relationships.

230
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,840
 And eventually, because of the product of sin

231
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,240
 and our world, that led to some real big distortions.

232
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,800
 I mean, we say that list would be too great to number

233
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,160
 throughout history, but one of the divisions that happened

234
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,160
 was abusive leadership and relationship styles from men.

235
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:55,100
 And God never created the world to be one

236
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,120
 where one male or female treated with less dignity

237
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,340
 the opposite sex because they were of the opposite sex.

238
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,060
 But sadly, that is the case today in many places

239
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,520
 and is sin anytime it exists.

240
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,520
 So I wanna paint a picture of the world before Jesus arrived

241
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,260
 or candidly, the world that Jesus arrived into.

242
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,580
 Because like I said, the way that you think about rights,

243
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,140
 people, has been so shaped, whether you're a Christian

244
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,880
 or not by the Judeo-Christian, in other words,

245
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,820
 by biblical thinking, that we just take it for granted.

246
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,980
 We think everybody, we think our founders,

247
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,500
 we hold these truths to be self-evident.

248
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,060
 All men are created equal.

249
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,020
 That's not accurate.

250
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,860
 They believe those are evident for them

251
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,060
 or they believe those are self-evident.

252
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,960
 There's a lot of people in human history that would disagree

253
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,840
 and in candidly, a tragic way,

254
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,220
 they didn't fully live out those beliefs.

255
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,680
 And yet, there's a lot of people around the world today

256
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,280
 that wouldn't say men and women are equal.

257
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,160
 Billions that wouldn't say that.

258
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,400
 The reason why we think that is because of Christian

259
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,140
 influence in the way that we think in our society,

260
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,800
 whether or not it's as strong as it once was.

261
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,960
 That is a biblical idea and as Christians,

262
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,720
 we have the benefit of saying, this is what God says.

263
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,160
 Every person, male and female, deserves dignity and respect.

264
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
 But that wasn't always the case

265
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,660
 in terms of the culture.

266
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,500
 What do I mean?

267
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,940
 So, second point, the world before Jesus.

268
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,780
 Let me paint a picture.

269
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,680
 Anyone know when Christianity was started,

270
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,600
 what the name of the empire that existed was?

271
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,440
 Roman Empire.

272
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,600
 You saw the movie Gladiator, boom, you got it.

273
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,680
 All right, Roman Empire conquered the known world

274
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,820
 and here's how the Romans thought about men and women.

275
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,960
 So, I'm gonna cover a few buckets.

276
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,120
 How they thought about women,

277
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,520
 how they thought about marriage as it related to

278
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,240
 a woman and male's or husband's role inside of that

279
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,120
 and daughters specifically

280
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,460
 because it is so distant from how we think about it,

281
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,120
 it's jarring.

282
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,820
 But the world that Jesus showed up in,

283
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,440
 the world before Jesus' influence took place,

284
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,180
 here's some of the teachings.

285
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,640
 Women were seen as legally worthless.

286
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,800
 If they were married, they were the property

287
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,080
 of their husband.

288
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,560
 They couldn't make the decision to get married.

289
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
 They were underneath the decision making of their father.

290
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,840
 They were not just seen legally

291
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,960
 as they couldn't testify in court,

292
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,280
 they didn't have those types of rights.

293
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,200
 Some of the most prominent teachers of the day

294
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,040
 taught this outright.

295
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,440
 Teachers, you've heard the names before,

296
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,600
 you don't remember anything they wrote

297
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,040
 'cause you did, you know,

298
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,200
 the, whatever the abbreviated version of reading

299
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,400
 in high school thing is, but teachers like Aristotle.

300
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
 You know what Aristotle thought about women?

301
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,740
 This comes from his book, The Generation of Animals.

302
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,280
 The female, as it were, is a mutilated male

303
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,760
 without a soul.

304
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,360
 How about that, tweet that.

305
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,080
 That's Aristotle.

306
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,520
 Not a Christian, by the way, hopefully that's clear.

307
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,320
 Plato, you maybe heard of Plato.

308
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,440
 Remember Plato, Plato's Republic,

309
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,760
 he wrote a letter called Timaeus,

310
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,040
 or he wrote a work called Timaeus,

311
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,360
 and in it he says, "It is only males

312
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,160
 "who were created by the gods and are given souls."

313
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,200
 It's only men who have souls.

314
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,080
 Those, this is crazy, man,

315
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,400
 those who live rightly, men who live rightly,

316
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,200
 in this life will return to the heavens,

317
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,880
 but those who are cowards

318
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,180
 will come back in the nature of women.

319
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,600
 You will be reincarnated.

320
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,820
 I mean, that's shocking to you, why?

321
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,560
 Because there's something inside of you that says,

322
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,480
 oh dude, that is messed up, man,

323
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,080
 we did not cover that in high school

324
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,520
 whenever we were doing the cheat sheets,

325
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,320
 or whatever, what is that called?

326
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,280
 Spark notes, there it is.

327
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,000
 Bunch of cheaters up here in the front.

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,360
 Went through high school,

329
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,160
 reading the spark notes version of everything.

330
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,360
 All right, it didn't get any better in Jewish culture.

331
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,720
 So, hey, that man was Romans, they worshiped Zeus,

332
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,660
 Aphrodite, you know, probably the Jewish men and women,

333
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,360
 which should have had a better understanding

334
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,580
 'cause they had the Old Testament,

335
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,960
 but they were not living in light of that.

336
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,740
 In Jewish culture, women were forbidden to learn.

337
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,000
 Education was not something offered to women.

338
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,080
 Women were not allowed in the synagogue to hear teaching.

339
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,800
 Josephus, the most famous historian of Jewish descent,

340
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,080
 he's where we get so much of our Jewish understanding

341
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,000
 outside of the Bible, he said this, this is powerful.

342
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 "The woman is in all things inferior to the man."

343
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,840
 Got really quiet in here, didn't it?

344
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,440
 And you hear that and it's like, what?

345
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,220
 And one, the Talmud, which is kind of a commentary

346
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,160
 on Old Testament, just rabbinical teaching, said,

347
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,300
 "I would rather have the Torah burned

348
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,960
 "than have it taught to a woman."

349
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,920
 Yeah, there's a first century prayer that was recorded

350
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,060
 that said, "Blessed are you, eternal God,

351
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,300
 "who's not made me a Gentile, a woman, or a slave."

352
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,660
 Can you imagine you show up to church

353
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,420
 and that's how Josiah started the announcement,

354
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,260
 hey God, we just wanna pray.

355
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,100
 At first, I just wanna thank you, God.

356
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,940
 I mean, it's so jarring, it's insulting.

357
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,040
 And the reason it's insulting is because Jesus

358
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,600
 did something that would change everything.

359
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,660
 It didn't just change the general perspective on women,

360
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,480
 it changed the way that people thought,

361
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,640
 even about daughters.

362
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,480
 Did you know that in the Roman Empire, which again,

363
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,760
 remember, that's where this whole thing started,

364
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,760
 Christianity launched from, for every 100 women,

365
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,400
 there was 140 men, why?

366
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,400
 Because when couples, Roman couples would have children,

367
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,420
 if it was a male, by law, it was required

368
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,940
 that they raise the child, it's called the law of Romulus,

369
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,320
 or the law of Rome, is the first law, if it's a male.

370
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,340
 But if it was a female, only the first,

371
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,540
 if she was a first born female, was she required to be kept.

372
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,220
 And a practice called exposure, which is horrific

373
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,780
 when you hear it, would take place where people

374
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,060
 would have a baby girl, and then they would expose it,

375
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,860
 or leave it out in the road, roadside, to die.

376
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,780
 There's a first century letter of a Roman soldier

377
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,460
 that wrote to his wife, and she was pregnant,

378
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,900
 and he said, if while I'm away at war, you deliver the child,

379
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,620
 if it is a boy, keep it, if it is a girl, discard it.

380
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,100
 There was inscriptions found in a city,

381
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,740
 basically a city of Delphi, and they basically

382
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,400
 had a census taken of all the families, first century.

383
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,840
 Out of 600 families, they got the list

384
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,640
 of everybody's family, 600 of them.

385
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,000
 Six had more than one daughter.

386
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,520
 Think about that.

387
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,360
 The context, and the abuse, and the distortion

388
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:58,540
 towards God's design of men and women was horrific.

389
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,120
 And this was the world in which Jesus showed up,

390
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,940
 and nothing would be the same as a result.

391
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,440
 As it related to marriage, the average age of marriage

392
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,440
 for Romans and for Jewish daughters was between 12 and 13.

393
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,360
 In fact, Josephus writes that a Jewish daughter

394
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,880
 should get engaged at 12, so that by the time she hits 13,

395
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,240
 she will have all of her reproductive years

396
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,480
 to attempt to give birth to children.

397
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,720
 Now, you hear that, and you're like,

398
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,320
 "Ha, no, he didn't, uh-uh!"

399
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,040
 'Cause for us, it's like, man, that is illegal

400
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,040
 and messed up, and the daughter had no choice in the matter.

401
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,480
 And I'm gonna show you in a second how Christianity,

402
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,460
 even in the first century, that went away for Christians.

403
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,200
 But the rights to divorce, sexual, sleeping around,

404
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,520
 basically, was commonplace for husbands.

405
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,000
 But if a wife did it, she could be put to death.

406
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,080
 This was not a culture that even suggested

407
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,320
 there was equality.

408
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,640
 It was, in law, you're a fool if you think that there is.

409
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
 The greatest teachers of the day made clear.

410
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,480
 And Christianity would show up and change all of that.

411
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,840
 There were two occasions, the Roman Senate,

412
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,520
 again, the Roman Empire had a Senate,

413
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,600
 kinda like we do today, on two occasions,

414
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,520
 two different bills were put before the Senate

415
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,160
 to mandate marriage for men.

416
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,040
 Think about that.

417
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
 That comes before all the craziness in our government.

418
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,280
 If they were at a place where they had to go,

419
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,500
 "Okay, we've gotta do something to get men to marry,"

420
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,200
 which honestly wouldn't be that bad of a deal, guys,

421
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,560
 pull the trigger, but all that today, in that day and age,

422
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,280
 he's saying men wouldn't marry because they could

423
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,720
 sleep around with whoever they wanted, prostitutes.

424
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,320
 Why would I want the responsibility and burden

425
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,680
 that comes along with that?

426
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,080
 And so that's the world before Jesus.

427
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,080
 Much of the world today exists, as we'll see in a second,

428
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,840
 but I wanna look at how Jesus would show up and say,

429
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,200
 "You have broken and you are distorting one of the,

430
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
 "half of the image bears on the planet,

431
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,280
 "and it is an offense to God."

432
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,000
 And so the world of women because of Jesus.

433
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,640
 As I said, Jesus would show up,

434
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,200
 and from the jump, everything would change.

435
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,840
 One of the first conversations,

436
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,960
 the longest conversation Jesus has

437
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,160
 with anyone in the New Testament,

438
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,880
 you know who it's with?

439
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,200
 A woman.

440
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,480
 It was uncommon for men to speak to women in that day.

441
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,120
 To make eye contact could have been seen as inappropriate,

442
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,480
 certainly to someone who wasn't your wife,

443
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,960
 not to speak to them, and Jesus shows up,

444
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,200
 we're told in John chapter four,

445
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,480
 and he's walking through the road,

446
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,040
 and there's this woman who comes up to a well

447
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,360
 to get a drink of water, and Jesus begins to go

448
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,040
 into this long conversation with,

449
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,320
 it's the longest conversation he has with anybody,

450
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,980
 and it's the very first time he tells anyone,

451
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,600
 I'm the Messiah.

452
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,720
 And it was a woman who'd been divorced five times.

453
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,160
 She was an outcast among outcasts.

454
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,480
 She wasn't even Jewish.

455
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,680
 And he said, "You're exactly the type of person I came

456
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,380
 "to restore your dignity and your worth

457
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,120
 "to you and to the world around you."

458
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,480
 And in John chapter four, the disciples see him,

459
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,200
 they walk up on Jesus having this conversation,

460
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,800
 and they're astonished because he's talking to a woman.

461
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,480
 It says this, John chapter four, verse 27,

462
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,260
 "His disciples just then came back.

463
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,200
 "They marveled that he was talking with a woman,

464
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,140
 "but no one said, 'What do you seek?'

465
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,800
 "or 'Why are you talking to her?'"

466
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,480
 And they marveled.

467
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,440
 Do you ever read those verses?

468
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,820
 You're like, "Why would they marvel he's talking to,

469
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,180
 "because it didn't happen."

470
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,440
 They were seen as less than,

471
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,060
 other than to Jesus, who said,

472
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,940
 "They're loved, they're not less."

473
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,500
 And he would do so over and over and over again.

474
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,920
 Jesus, unlike the time that discouraged women

475
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,240
 or barred women from learning, had women disciples.

476
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,040
 The word for disciple is a learner

477
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,200
 that would follow him around,

478
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,300
 that were a part of his group,

479
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,920
 that he taught actively, proactively.

480
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,160
 In fact, if you remember the Mary and Martha

481
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,400
 conversation and interaction,

482
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
 which maybe if you've been in church, you've heard,

483
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,280
 that they go over to Martha's house,

484
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,000
 and Martha's in the kitchen, she's cleaning

485
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,120
 and making pita bread or whatever they had

486
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,320
 for meals back then.

487
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,780
 And her sister Mary was sitting at the feet of Jesus,

488
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,740
 and Martha's like, "What are you doing, Mary?

489
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,000
 "Get in here and help me cook.

490
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,540
 "That's not for us, that's for them."

491
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,420
 And Jesus says, "She's not going anywhere.

492
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,560
 "She's chosen what is better."

493
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,760
 But he actively encouraged it.

494
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,380
 In fact, in that day, sexual sin,

495
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,880
 distortedly, was always attributed to the male.

496
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,480
 The law didn't teach that, but it would be taught

497
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,240
 that sexual sin would have been

498
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,200
 because the woman drew the man off sides.

499
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,060
 And so a woman was caught in adultery in John chapter eight,

500
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,220
 and the law said both the man and the woman

501
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,740
 should have been thrown before Jesus.

502
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,740
 But the religious leaders caught the woman

503
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,640
 threw her before Jesus.

504
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,560
 And he bends down, tenderly writes something,

505
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,920
 and as they say, "The law says she should die.

506
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,940
 "What do you say?"

507
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,780
 He stands up and he says, "Let whoever has not sinned

508
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,100
 "go to the first stone."

509
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,800
 Ironically, the only one who had not sinned was him.

510
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,060
 And they walk away, one by one,

511
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,500
 and Jesus, just there with the woman, says,

512
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,540
 "Where are your accusers?"

513
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,420
 She says, "They've gone."

514
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:42,280
 And he says, "Go and sin no more."

515
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,060
 I don't condone what you've done, and I don't condemn you.

516
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,380
 I came to die for you,

517
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,340
 because you are an image bearer of God.

518
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,860
 And you may live in a society that doesn't promote that,

519
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,780
 push that, but that's the truth.

520
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:04,760
 We see this consistently taught after Jesus died

521
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,740
 and rose and ascended to heaven by his followers.

522
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,860
 Peter would say this in 1 Peter chapter three,

523
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,100
 and we're so used to this

524
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,620
 that it's no longer profound to us,

525
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,220
 but it was jarring to the first century,

526
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,580
 who lived in that context that I'm describing.

527
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,540
 1 Peter chapter three, verse seven says,

528
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,460
 "Husbands, in the same way,

529
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,340
 "be considerate as you live with your wives.

530
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,100
 "Treat them with respect or honor

531
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,520
 "as the weaker partner,

532
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,260
 "and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life,

533
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,220
 "so that nothing will hinder your prayers."

534
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,780
 So he's talking to husbands, and he says something,

535
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,620
 and this is where people go,

536
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,300
 "Well, ah, okay, weaker partner, that's it, Bible sexist."

537
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,940
 Peter's saying something pretty profound.

538
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,900
 He's saying, "Hey, when it comes, husbands,

539
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,980
 "here's how I want you to treat, you know,

540
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,060
 "the Jewish society, everyone around says their property,

541
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,560
 "you don't have to listen to them.

542
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,980
 "If they step out of line, you can do basically anything."

543
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,220
 Nope, I want you to live and be considerate

544
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,900
 of their feelings, of who they are.

545
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,220
 I want you to live, not just,

546
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,860
 don't even treat them with equal.

547
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,100
 It says, "Treat them with honor."

548
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,820
 How do you honor someone?

549
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,060
 Everyone, I mean, you've probably never thought about it,

550
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,340
 but instinctively, most of us probably know,

551
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,980
 if the Queen of England came in this room,

552
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,580
 you would know, and you'd give her your seat,

553
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,420
 and you would know how to honor her.

554
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,700
 You would defer to them.

555
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,540
 And that's what Peter just said.

556
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,860
 It's a whole new day.

557
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,980
 You treat them with honor and with respect.

558
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,260
 So what about the weaker vessel or partner?

559
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,060
 The same word, it's translated for delicate.

560
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,660
 And then today, bizarrely, there's something of like,

561
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,540
 "Oh, no, I'm not weaker, I'm not weaker.

562
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,980
 "Look at me, I'm so strong."

563
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,900
 And Peter is saying, "Hey, treat them with a delicacy,

564
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,740
 "or be more gentle and respectful with them."

565
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,380
 It has nothing to do with value.

566
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,420
 People immediately run to value.

567
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,580
 You saying I'm weaker, you saying I'm less?

568
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,380
 No, this is a bottle of water.

569
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,260
 This is an iPhone.

570
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,820
 If I drop this, nothing happens.

571
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,060
 If I drop this, like I did last week,

572
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,360
 the screen could break.

573
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,700
 Which one is more valuable?

574
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,320
 The water?

575
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,620
 Really?

576
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,940
 You're buying your water, bro.

577
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,860
 It's a phone.

578
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,740
 Something being more delicate

579
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,380
 doesn't make it any less valuable.

580
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,220
 In fact, there's plenty of things

581
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,820
 that are much more valuable.

582
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,700
 And Peter is saying, "Hey, you are accountable."

583
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,440
 When he says, "Your heirs, they are co-heirs with you

584
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,820
 "of the gracious gift of life."

585
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,180
 He says, "They are heirs.

586
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,260
 "They have a Father in heaven

587
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,400
 "who you're gonna give an account to.

588
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,040
 "You are dating or married to the boss's daughter.

589
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,080
 "You should tread lightly."

590
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,300
 That's what he just said.

591
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,460
 And clap for that, there you go.

592
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,180
 And then he said something that even is more profound.

593
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,340
 Hey, and if you don't do this,

594
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,740
 when you break down the verse,

595
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,740
 everyone goes, "Weaker partner, you saying I'm weaker?

596
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,940
 "Huh, binge press right now?

597
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,260
 "Let's go, let's go."

598
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,100
 It's like, he's saying,

599
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:07,260
 "You use your strength to serve, protect, die to yourself."

600
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,820
 And if you don't, it will hinder your prayers.

601
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,880
 I mean, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.

602
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,440
 As in, if you don't treat the boss's daughter well,

603
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,680
 he's not going to listen as closely.

604
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,080
 This was radical.

605
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,880
 And it would continue to be radical,

606
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,200
 as we're gonna see it change

607
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,680
 to have people flock to the church.

608
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,320
 In Galatians chapter three, verse 26 to 28,

609
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 the very first writing that we see as blatantly clear,

610
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,140
 men and women are totally equal,

611
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,120
 is Galatians three, verse 26.

612
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,720
 "In Christ, all of you are children of God through faith.

613
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,340
 "All of you were baptized into Christ,

614
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,660
 "have clothed yourself with Christ.

615
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,300
 "There's neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free,

616
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,300
 "nor is there male or female.

617
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,800
 "For all of you are one in Christ Jesus."

618
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,800
 He is saying, everyone is now defined most by Christ.

619
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:13,820
 And that is the most significant thing about a person.

620
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,000
 Thomas Cahill was a historian that wrote,

621
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,440
 "This was the very first time

622
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,340
 "in all of ancient literature we can find someone,

623
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,000
 "hey, there is no difference,

624
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,740
 "male and female are totally equal."

625
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,140
 And we hear this and we go, dude, that's so crazy.

626
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,320
 At the time that people would think

627
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,660
 that even needs to be said.

628
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,520
 This was new.

629
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,600
 And when the New Testament was new,

630
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,880
 this was revolutionary.

631
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,680
 And it's the reason you think the way that you do.

632
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,920
 And let me just tell you what happened.

633
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,120
 As we would see in church history,

634
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,380
 and if you study any of this,

635
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,600
 there's a great book by Rodney Stark

636
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,660
 called "The Rise of Christianity."

637
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,980
 He's got so many different great works,

638
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,040
 but he just tracks with incredible documentation,

639
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,380
 the explosive movement of the church.

640
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,440
 And one of the things that you see with the church

641
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,120
 is that when the New Testament was new,

642
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,160
 when this movement began, women flooded to the church.

643
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,920
 Two thirds of the first century church was women.

644
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,920
 In a time where two thirds of the people

645
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,520
 alive on earth were men, they flooded there.

646
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,200
 To say that the New Testament or the Bible

647
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,880
 or Christianity has shown an instance

648
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,560
 would have been laughable to them.

649
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,740
 Because women found for the very first time,

650
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,080
 I can show up and I am treated with dignity.

651
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,200
 Unlike, remember the categories I referenced earlier?

652
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,840
 Of hey, when it came to marriage,

653
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,640
 when it came to children, when it came to daughters,

654
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,760
 women flooded there because of the rights

655
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,800
 and the way that they were treated

656
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,240
 with dignity so distinctly.

657
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,160
 In fact, Roman historian, there's so many of them

658
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,000
 and I don't have time to list them all,

659
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,960
 but one of the different critics of Christianity

660
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,800
 of the day who would write,

661
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,700
 whenever they would wanna burn in a dig,

662
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,120
 they would say, look, Christians,

663
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,600
 they're just made up of a bunch of poor people and women.

664
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,520
 That was one of the biggest attacks that they would give.

665
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,560
 There's a guy named Menaeus Felix,

666
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,400
 we'll just go with Felix.

667
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,040
 He wrote an apologetic work called "Octavius"

668
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
 and his criticism was that Christianity

669
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,740
 is made of the lowest of society and gullible women.

670
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,100
 Over and over, there's critiques of like,

671
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,920
 it's just women and nobody's in there.

672
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,080
 Because women found a home and they found dignity

673
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,720
 and every socioeconomic sense flooded to the church

674
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,200
 because it was there that they found and were treated,

675
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,400
 you are made in the image of God.

676
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,880
 They were given leadership opportunity.

677
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,800
 In Romans chapter 16, we don't have time to go there,

678
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,400
 Paul is writing and he says, hey,

679
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,600
 our sister Phoebe greets you.

680
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,320
 She's a deaconess in the church of Acacia.

681
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,160
 What's a deaconess?

682
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,100
 It is a leader inside of the church.

683
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,360
 The Roman historian Pliny the Elder,

684
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,800
 which is like a great rapper name,

685
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
 but he wrote something and he was not a Christian

686
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,640
 and he basically was like,

687
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,800
 I'm trying to figure out this Christian movement and cult.

688
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,900
 So I found two Christians.

689
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,840
 I found these two slave women

690
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,720
 who were deaconesses at their church.

691
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,020
 Here's what they told me.

692
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:05,360
 That a slave that had no worth in the eyes of Rome

693
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,520
 was given leadership, dignity and value and women flooded.

694
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,760
 Unlike marriage, like I said,

695
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,500
 the average age of 12 or 13.

696
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,440
 Inside of the Christian church, women,

697
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,760
 it wasn't just, hey, you're gonna marry 'cause I said.

698
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,080
 Women were given for the first time the choice

699
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,360
 to marry when they wanted to.

700
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,040
 And the average age moved up to 18,

701
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,300
 which is thankfully in striking zone of being legal.

702
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,300
 But when you compare that to 13, it was radical.

703
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,600
 And not only that, inside of marriage,

704
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,080
 men were told something that is like,

705
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,720
 duh to us, but was radical of the day.

706
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,600
 Hey, you don't sleep with anybody but her

707
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,720
 and you honor her and you died to yourself

708
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,720
 and you love each other and you pursue oneness together.

709
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,680
 And by the way, you don't divorce her.

710
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,920
 Women didn't have the right to divorce

711
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,240
 and men were told, hey, you cannot divorce her.

712
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
 You stay with her and you make it work

713
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,260
 and you fight for her.

714
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,680
 All of which is beautiful today

715
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,700
 and we're all like, yay, that's how it should be.

716
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,240
 No one had ever seen it be like that.

717
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,940
 And women flooded in because they were given something

718
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,940
 that they had never had before.

719
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,280
 Dignity, tragically.

720
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,000
 And the church flooded with these.

721
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,280
 And in terms of children or daughters,

722
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,940
 as I said, there was a vast under population of women

723
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,360
 because daughters were given up

724
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,540
 and Christians began to change that

725
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,100
 because Christians would redefine adoption.

726
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,860
 I mean, this is so historical, so stay with me, everybody.

727
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,120
 Adoption, how you think of it, what do you think of?

728
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,520
 First thing that comes to mind?

729
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,620
 A baby, right?

730
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,900
 Brad and Angelina, 17 kids walking around.

731
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,340
 That's not how Rome thought of it.

732
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,780
 Adoption was a legal process that adults did.

733
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,780
 In other words, every emperor that you've ever heard of

734
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,740
 or will ever hear of, and your Spark Notes section

735
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,260
 doesn't even know what emperors I'm talking about,

736
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,520
 all were adopted.

737
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,960
 Why?

738
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,900
 Because at that day and age,

739
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,320
 if somebody had a valuable estate,

740
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,220
 they would go, well, look at my kids

741
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,140
 and this is not a good idea.

742
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,240
 I'm gonna adopt him.

743
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,480
 And they would hand select.

744
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,060
 Adoption was among adults until Christians showed up

745
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,340
 and all those babies laid out by the riverside

746
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,800
 or laid out by the road, they'd show up

747
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,940
 and they would adopt them.

748
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,780
 They would take them into their homes

749
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,780
 'cause they said every person is valuable, has dignity.

750
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:38,060
 Abortion became extinct among Christian communities.

751
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,780
 This is even a reference in early Christian literature.

752
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,700
 And there's so much debate around our topic.

753
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,220
 You know who was not pro-choice in the first century?

754
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,360
 Women.

755
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,720
 And don't lose me on all the political leanings of today.

756
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,380
 They were not given a choice.

757
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,660
 Men were.

758
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,720
 And Christians said, no, you don't commit abortion anymore.

759
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,280
 And as a woman, you go, well, you know,

760
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,320
 maybe she wanted one.

761
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,740
 They were never given a choice.

762
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,720
 Abortion happened because of abusive men

763
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,840
 who said she's pregnant and I don't want the baby.

764
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,760
 And this is a time where there's no antibiotics,

765
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
 there's no doctors.

766
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,700
 The ways that happened was gruesome

767
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,440
 and left the woman sterile.

768
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,700
 And Christians said, no.

769
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,460
 And they introduced a revolution

770
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,460
 that your thought process throughout this message

771
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,820
 is directly connected to.

772
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,500
 Whatever feelings, emotions, concerns,

773
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,380
 things that you're thinking of,

774
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,380
 of like, ooh, that's weird, I'm not comfortable with that,

775
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,380
 is because that revolution would go far and wide

776
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:45,500
 as the church would go far and wide.

777
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,260
 Finally, a world today without Jesus,

778
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,100
 and I gotta hurry.

779
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,940
 Still today, any time the presence of the people of God

780
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,460
 and the word of God and the son of God

781
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,140
 has not impacted people's life,

782
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:03,140
 today in our world, there is not an appropriate equality

783
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,260
 based on the image of God that exists in male and female.

784
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,980
 In other words, any time that Christianity

785
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,700
 and the message of Jesus has not begun to spread place,

786
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,540
 all over the world today,

787
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,540
 people still think like the Romans did.

788
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,380
 What do I mean?

789
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,540
 Here's some examples, man,

790
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,060
 I'm gonna touch the tip of the iceberg

791
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,300
 'cause it is tragic.

792
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,460
 Billions of people live

793
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,740
 and they don't think like you think.

794
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,580
 It's not natural.

795
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,060
 It's been informed by the people of God

796
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,580
 and the word of God.

797
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,620
 In China, there was a 40 million gap

798
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,740
 or 40 million number of quote unquote missing girls

799
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,780
 because of decades of the one child, one mother,

800
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,780
 one child, one mother, one child, one child.

801
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,660
 The one child policy that led to sex selective abortion.

802
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,940
 China said you can only have one kid.

803
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,060
 And through the process of infanticide

804
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,420
 and sex selective abortion,

805
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,900
 now 40 million less women live

806
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,620
 or 40 million less women than men.

807
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,820
 United Nations has estimated, this was from 2022,

808
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:08,820
 between 150 and 200 million more boys than girls are alive

809
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,940
 because of selective abortion in sub-Saharan Africa,

810
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,900
 Asia, and the Middle East.

811
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,580
 In Africa, female genital mutilation

812
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:26,460
 impacts the lives of 3 million girls every year.

813
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:33,300
 That is all of the population of Dallas every year.

814
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,800
 People who were made in the image of God have a soul.

815
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,180
 Who Jesus gave his life for on the cross.

816
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,180
 It is not normal the way that you think.

817
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,940
 Child marriage is a global issue.

818
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,860
 12 million under the age of 18

819
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,980
 get married every single year.

820
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,940
 In Afghanistan, significantly, especially since the fall

821
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,420
 and the rise of the Taliban earlier this year,

822
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,900
 has become the worst place for women to live today

823
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,760
 according to Human Rights Watch and the Georgetown Institute.

824
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,540
 Only 7% of women have a bank account or access to one.

825
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,220
 80% of women are not employed

826
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,840
 due to the Taliban's restrictions on where they can work,

827
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,940
 when they can work, and what they should wear.

828
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,520
 The Taliban has banned secondary

829
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,140
 or higher education at any level.

830
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,440
 They dictate what they wear, how they can travel,

831
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,580
 if they can work, what kind of cell phones they can have.

832
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,760
 And you may think, well, man,

833
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,160
 we've all seen crazy Taliban.

834
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,320
 Let's go Saudi Arabia.

835
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,360
 Saudi Arabia, today, women do not have the freedom

836
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,280
 to leave the country.

837
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,400
 They cannot get a passport.

838
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,680
 They cannot travel outside of their house

839
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,080
 without the permission of their guardian.

840
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,920
 Who's a guardian?

841
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,320
 Their dad or their husband.

842
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,840
 They cannot get married without a co-signing of their dad

843
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,320
 on the marriage contract.

844
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,600
 And they cannot leave that marriage under any circumstances.

845
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,160
 The husband can marry whenever, whoever he wants,

846
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,120
 and marry up to four women at one time.

847
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,960
 Saudi Arabia didn't allow women,

848
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,380
 you know, Saudi Arabia, our president just flew over there

849
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,940
 to get more oil deal.

850
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,040
 Until 2018, women could not drive cars in Saudi Arabia

851
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,500
 and could be prosecuted or even have significant costs

852
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,740
 to themselves if they showed an ankle in public.

853
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,220
 And this world that has not been touched by Jesus

854
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,980
 does not believe equality is something that is true

855
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,820
 or should be reflected.

856
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:20,260
 In Iran, FIFA World Cup, everybody familiar with that?

857
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,680
 May 29th, 2022, which is, oh yeah, that's this year,

858
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,900
 the World Cup was taking place.

859
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,020
 And in Iran, they had qualified to semifinals

860
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,820
 or they were qualified and they had a game

861
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,860
 that was gonna take place inside of Iran.

862
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:40,420
 At the game, women who attempted to enter into the arena

863
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,100
 or into the stadium, despite having purchased tickets,

864
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,660
 were sprayed with pepper spray

865
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,700
 because women are not allowed to see sporting events.

866
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,740
 And this is everywhere.

867
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,180
 We don't have time to go into all the different Qatar.

868
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,260
 In order for women to get married,

869
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,580
 she has to have the permission of some guardian in her life.

870
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:04,580
 And if she leaves the house without her husband's permission,

871
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,380
 if she refuses to have sex,

872
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,140
 if she refuses or leaves and does something

873
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,460
 without telling him, she has been deemed as disobedient

874
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,340
 and there are consequences.

875
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,360
 This doesn't even cover Indonesia, India, Pakistan.

876
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,980
 Anytime the people of God are not anchored

877
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,300
 to the word of God and that presence is not felt there,

878
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,220
 the way that you think is not normal

879
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,260
 and let me just, this is the last thing I'm gonna cover.

880
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,700
 This is existent in our culture today

881
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,280
 that reams and yells, you sexist bigots.

882
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,220
 And yet American Western culture

883
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,780
 increasingly is influenced in a way

884
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,240
 that is apart from Jesus.

885
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,140
 And when that happens, a couple of things happen.

886
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,180
 You either undervalue women or you misvalue

887
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,220
 and value the wrong things.

888
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,060
 What do I mean by that?

889
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,380
 Our culture swings to the other pendulum and says,

890
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,380
 hey, women, you're valuable because of what's

891
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,820
 between your legs or what your body looks like

892
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,660
 or your sexuality or a host of other different things.

893
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,620
 What do I say that every cultural,

894
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,300
 epitome of culture in every direction, movies, music,

895
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,920
 everything communicates this message on a daily basis

896
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,700
 and it objectifies women, which is sexist.

897
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,540
 What do I mean?

898
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,820
 Here's some of the more popular songs.

899
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,320
 This is from "Freaky Deaky" by Tyga and Doja Cat.

900
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,160
 Ready?

901
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,740
 My little shorty, always on time.

902
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,140
 I pick you up, come outside.

903
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,020
 Let's go for a ride.

904
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,720
 Body likes December on summertime.

905
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,300
 Itty bitty waist, but I'm just gonna let y'all

906
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,300
 read the rest of it.

907
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,720
 (congregation laughing)

908
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:44,980
 You don't think a culture that continues to listen

909
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,500
 and some of the top songs in music.

910
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,340
 Let's go to the next one.

911
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,780
 WAP, Cardi B.

912
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,120
 (congregation laughing)

913
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
 Excuse me, hold on, we're almost done.

914
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,140
 There's some horrors in this house.

915
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,740
 Repeat times 12.

916
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,580
 (congregation laughing)

917
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,540
 I'm not even gonna read the rest of it.

918
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:13,500
 But as Christians, let me just speak to you ladies

919
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,340
 really quick and all of us.

920
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:22,220
 A culture that encourages or promotes women,

921
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,900
 calling themselves or other people whores

922
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,780
 is an inferior, toxic, evil culture.

923
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,500
 And identifying yourself, yeah,

924
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,400
 you can golf clap for that or what.

925
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,200
 (congregation applauding)

926
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,300
 And as Christians, we have never thought

927
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,860
 all cultures are created equal.

928
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,340
 We think we have a superior culture in Christ

929
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,500
 that says women are made in the image of God.

930
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,620
 They have eternal value.

931
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,900
 They're worthy of being treated with dignity and respect

932
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,620
 and their value does not come from their body,

933
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,780
 what they wear, what they look like.

934
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,780
 It comes from the fact that they're made in the image of God

935
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,680
 and men, we have a responsibility to make sure

936
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,940
 we don't participate, communicate,

937
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,620
 encourage anything that further objectifies sexually.

938
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,060
 And women, you have a responsibility to make sure

939
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,700
 you don't continually endorse or promote things

940
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,700
 that say I am valuable because of my sex or my body.

941
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,500
 And we see the drift happening.

942
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,500
 And so it undervalues, misvalues or it redefines.

943
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,360
 I mean, this is how tragically in need of Jesus

944
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,560
 our culture is.

945
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:29,240
 The nominations for woman of the year among NCAA

946
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,900
 came out last week or have been out recently.

947
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,360
 One of the nominations was Leah Thomas.

948
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:42,520
 Leah, for the first three years of college, swam as a man

949
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,720
 and swam the final year as a female.

950
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:57,560
 I mean, nothing but love and care and concern

951
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,540
 for anyone who doesn't know Jesus.

952
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,860
 But when we have a society that says,

953
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,360
 where are my whores at?

954
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:13,960
 And the winner of a women's award

955
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,580
 swam with the men 18 months ago.

956
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:25,560
 You can see we are assaulting the image of God on humanity.

957
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:39,520
 As I think about my daughter, and if you're in the room,

958
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,640
 I hope you know, no matter what story you have,

959
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,000
 no matter what amount of pain, damage, goods,

960
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,800
 however you see yourself, you have such eternal value.

961
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,440
 It would be impossible to overstate how valuable you are

962
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,160
 no matter what you've done, where you're from,

963
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,280
 what you look like, 'cause you are an image bearer

964
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,960
 of God Almighty.

965
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,080
 And he gave his life on the cross for you.

966
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,040
 And he gave his life on the cross for every person

967
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,440
 who's ever lived, because they are made in his image.

968
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,760
 And he set on fire a revolution

969
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,720
 that all people should be treated with dignity

970
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,880
 and with respect, 'cause they are made in my image.

971
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,840
 My kids, you just saw 'em, I've shared before,

972
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,300
 have had to teach or I've had to help them understand

973
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,000
 what the value of a coin is.

974
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,440
 They've been doing chores around the house

975
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,880
 and they'll get paid in various amounts.

976
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,680
 I'm teaching them, oh, that's a quarter.

977
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,120
 Oh, that's a nickel.

978
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,800
 That's a dime, that's a penny.

979
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,140
 For us, you're like, duh.

980
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,880
 But when you can't read, you can't fully understand it,

981
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,480
 you're like, oh, how do you know if it's a quarter?

982
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,360
 Is it silver?

983
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,320
 No, there's ones that are silver that are not quarters.

984
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,700
 Okay, is it because it's big?

985
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,800
 Is it like, hey, the smaller it is, the less it's worth?

986
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,760
 No, the dime really threw that thing off.

987
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,960
 Is it, like, what is, how do I know what the value of it is?

988
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,240
 Whose image is on it?

989
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,880
 How do you know how valuable you are,

990
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,480
 whose image is on you?

991
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,040
 And no matter what happens for the rest of your life,

992
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,060
 you are of an eternal value.

993
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,000
 And anyone who treats you as less

994
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,920
 is operating against God's design, an amazing creation.

995
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,240
 And now as Christians, we're called to go promote

996
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,940
 a superior culture to a world that desperately needs it.

997
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,200
 Let me pray.

998
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,160
 Father, I pray for anyone who's carrying baggage

999
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,220
 from hurt related to you, hurt related to the church,

1000
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,940
 hurt done in the name of you

1001
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,600
 that wasn't an accurate representation of your plan,

1002
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,200
 your love, your design,

1003
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,480
 that you would heal and bind up those hurts,

1004
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,080
 that they would have a conversation if they need to.

1005
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,400
 I pray for anyone who has never trusted in Jesus

1006
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,760
 as the payment of their sin,

1007
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,600
 has never accepted the eternal gift

1008
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
 that God, you gave us through your son

1009
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,920
 because you loved us so much and saw our value

1010
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,920
 as of eternal worth.

1011
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,320
 Tonight would be that night.

1012
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,080
 We love you.

1013
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,400
 Thank you for Jesus, who's changed the world

1014
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,840
 and is changing our lives.

1015
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,280
 We worship him in song, amen.
