[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.440]   - What's up, Porch?
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.780]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.920]   Thank you, I paid that entire section to be here.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.640]   Guys, it is so good to be with you tonight.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.240]   My name is Josh Thames, and I have the wonderful privilege
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.560]   of being on the Porch team over in Fort Worth.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.520]   Welcome to all of you guys here in the room tonight,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.560]   all of everyone listening online.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.500]   Guys, Phoenix, Phoenix started the Porch tonight.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.100]   Welcome, Phoenix.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.880]   They are living in the promised land,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.320]   living in Arizona, and now the Porch is there.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.900]   I'm excited for them.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.800]   Guys, we are in an incredible series.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.680]   I've enjoyed it called Self-Care,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.040]   where we have taken a dive into a biblical look
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.440]   into what does it mean to care for our mind, soul,
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.560]   and our body, and tonight, tonight,
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.600]   we are talking about a subject
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.240]   that I am really passionate about.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.400]   I'm really passionate about it.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.280]   This is what this has looked like for me.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.400]   We're talking about what it looks like
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.440]   to care for your body, a biblical perspective
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.680]   on how to care for your body,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.240]   and this has been something you guys need to know
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.820]   that for 25 years of my life that I didn't do right.
[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.320]   Like for 25 years, I was pretty sure
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.400]   that my body was just about me,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.800]   and I sought affirmation really in two ways.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.480]   The first way was this, in just the way that I looked.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.400]   I sought affirmation in the way that I looked.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.320]   I was really excited about being fit from here to here,
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.920]   or really in the way that my body
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.040]   could perform as an athlete.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.560]   That changed for me.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.080]   Four years ago when I came here,
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.520]   and friends of mine, Bobby and Becca,
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.900]   asked me to jump into a ministry called Well.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.100]   And in that ministry, we spent, myself and others,
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.460]   spent 12 weeks taking a deep dive into God's word,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.180]   and what does it have to say about our bodies.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.140]   And it changed my life.
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.520]   I began to learn for the first time
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.820]   that my body was not my own,
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.940]   that it was given to me by God,
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.440]   and instead of for my glory, actually for his.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.780]   And so at the end of 12 weeks,
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.480]   not only was I more physically healthy,
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.880]   there was a healthiness between me
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.460]   and my relationship with God, just personally,
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.620]   as I began to see what that looked like.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.280]   And here's why I'm excited about it.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.860]   Really, there's two reasons.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.060]   And the first one is this,
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.580]   is I don't think that we have done an excellent job
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.560]   talking about this subject.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.980]   I mean, it, in a lot of ways, is kind of taboo.
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.460]   I mean, we'll talk about pornography,
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.240]   and we'll talk about drug addiction and alcohol abuse,
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.620]   but talking about our bodies is just something
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.260]   that I frankly don't think we have done
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.380]   an excellent job about.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.300]   And then the second reason is this,
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.100]   is that each one of us has a relationship with this topic.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.980]   Each one of us has a relationship with the topic
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.820]   of how to care for your body,
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.220]   because each one of us has a body.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.860]   Every person in here.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.500]   So this is, whether or not you've thought about it well,
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.900]   or you haven't, each one of us has a body,
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.380]   each have a relationship with how we view,
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.820]   treat it, and care for it.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.380]   And so here's the thing.
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.980]   I think our culture is telling us
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.860]   there really seems to be two extremes.
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.660]   Two extremes here in our view of the body.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.340]   One extreme is like, hey, you're obsessed with working out
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.260]   and making your body look a certain way, right?
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.460]   Hashtag fit fam, or motivation.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.660]   This is not motivation, it's demotivating.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.220]   And then the other camp is this.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.220]   The other camp is really like,
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.500]   hey, you just like love for you for you, you know?
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.460]   Like, the way you're made is great.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.540]   Like get somebody like self-love,
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.540]   curves of the new beautiful, right?
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.000]   You can't body shame me.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.820]   There seems to be like really two camps here.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.040]   And I don't know if you may end up on one of those extremes,
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.700]   but it just seems the problem with both of those
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.380]   is that they center around us and not around God.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.820]   And you're gonna be like,
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.420]   well, I don't land in either one of those extremes,
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.940]   but I do think that if you pay attention tonight
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.660]   that there's things inside of God's word
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.500]   that are going to help you
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.460]   in how you view and care for your body.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.800]   God cares that we are healthy.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.340]   He cares about our fitness,
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.480]   but I think differently than the way you and I care.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.500]   We're gonna be taking a look at what the world says
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.420]   about this topic, what the world says,
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.900]   what the word says, and then how to,
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.020]   how to care for our bodies
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.660]   in light of what God's word has to say.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.820]   And so if you have your Bibles,
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.260]   you guys can open those up to 1 Corinthians.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.140]   1 Corinthians 6 verses 19 and 20.
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.860]   This is Paul writing to the church in Corinth.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.060]   And so it should be up here on the screen
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.620]   and I'll read it to us.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.940]   He says this, "Or do you not know
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.300]   that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.580]   whom you have from God?
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.220]   You are not your own,
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.820]   for you were bought with a price.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.700]   So glorify God in your body."
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.840]   In context, Paul is warning against the use of our body
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.700]   in sexual sin, but he says some pretty crazy things here.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.780]   He says, one, that our bodies are a dwelling place
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.100]   for the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.580]   And then that our bodies are not our own,
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.620]   they're actually God's.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.680]   And because they are God's,
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.900]   our bodies are meant to bring him glory and not us.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.820]   My first point this evening is this,
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.820]   the world says to worship our bodies as God.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.460]   And when I say worship, I don't mean
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.020]   what just happened here with the lights low
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.500]   and our hands up high,
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.220]   but what I mean by worship is to love, admire,
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.580]   and to care for something very, very much,
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.220]   and to make something that God in your life
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.380]   is to mean your world centers around it.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.060]   Right, that it's kind of everything to you.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.020]   The world is telling us to worship our bodies as God.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.980]   I mean, it's almost as if everything around you
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.900]   is telling you that what you look like is everything.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:25.120]   We see this, it doesn't take long to see this play out.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.820]   TVs reinforce this, movies reinforce this,
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.060]   pornography reinforces this,
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.340]   the billboards that we drive by reinforces this,
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.460]   fitness blogs and models are literally making a living
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.440]   because of the way that they look.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.020]   Our world is telling us to worship our bodies as God.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.820]   And we also say that if we worship,
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.100]   if you worship your body good enough,
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.380]   we're gonna worship you as God.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.020]   You don't believe me, I'll prove it to you.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.020]   Anyone in here know the name Harrison Schmidt?
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.700]   Harrison Schmidt, anyone?
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.820]   Harrison Schmidt was the last man to walk on the moon.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.380]   Like there's been 12 total people,
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.620]   Harrison Schmidt being one of them
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.940]   that ever have walked on the moon.
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.580]   You have to imagine that as he's walking around up there,
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.100]   you know, like I don't know how that like looked,
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.540]   it had to have been amazing, you know, he's like,
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.260]   I can't wait to be a household name.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.620]   Like I'm never paying for a meal or drink
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.700]   for the rest of my life, right?
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.020]   Yeah, I'm gonna be a household name.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.340]   People are gonna name their kids after me.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.020]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.780]   You know what is a household name?
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.940]   Kim Kardashian.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.700]   Gotcha, yeah, why?
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.700]   Because of how she looks.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.380]   But I mean, she hasn't done anything like amazing,
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.380]   she hasn't created something,
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.180]   she's not like flipping houses down in Waco.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.500]   I mean, literally because of the way that she looks,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.420]   we know her, right?
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.660]   So in like the famous club, who's gonna be famous?
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.100]   Who's gonna be a household name club?
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.300]   They're like, walk on the moon, meh, got a big butt.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.740]   Yep, you're in, right?
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.620]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.820]   It's crazy the world that we live in.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.140]   We were literally saying, hey,
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.740]   if you worship your body as God,
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.180]   good enough, I'm gonna worship you as God.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.500]   It's craziness.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.300]   It's craziness and it's affecting all of us.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.260]   We're buying into this way of thinking.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.780]   Cosmetic surgeries are up 200% since the year 2000.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.060]   Surgery, surgeries that are enhancing the way
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.940]   that you look and enhancing your physical features
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.020]   have become normal today.
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.580]   They've become normal.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.580]   What we choose to post on social media shows us this.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.740]   Like, I'm gonna post that 'cause I look great, right?
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.180]   What we choose to not post on social media proves this.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.940]   We are buying into the lie that we are meant
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.020]   to worship our bodies as God.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.620]   Here's another thing.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.060]   Another way I know this for a fact is when you go,
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.820]   a lot of us are hiring personal trainers
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.060]   and I don't know if you guys have ever,
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:58.980]   some of you may have not,
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.900]   but when you, there's a classic question they ask you
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.540]   which is, "Hey, what are your goals?"
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.220]   And it's like, "To be hot?"
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.420]   Right?
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.540]   Six pack would be good.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.500]   How much would an eight pack cost me?
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.540]   Right, I mean, it's one thing.
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.420]   And so what I'm trying to do here is to show you
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.180]   that it is clear that in God's word,
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.100]   the temple being our bodies that he's talking about,
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.740]   which is a place where we go to worship.
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.220]   Instead of worshiping in this place,
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.380]   the world is telling us to worship the place,
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.540]   the temple itself.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.260]   Instead of worshiping in the temple,
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.980]   we are worshiping our bodies.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.160]   If you invest into your body,
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.300]   you're investing in something that's depreciating.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.780]   Like it's going away.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.500]   Like gravity wins, people.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.780]   Like, I don't know if you know this.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.060]   I had a friend tell me this recently.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.060]   He said, "Hey, when you wanna think about
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.640]   "what you're gonna look like when you get older,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.820]   "like don't pick up a magazine.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.300]   "Like go to like an old photo album
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.740]   "and find like your grandma.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.260]   "Like that's where you're headed."
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.740]   Right?
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.580]   That's where you're headed.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.460]   And it'd be if in 2013, your friend said,
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.300]   "Hey, you know what?
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.780]   "We should all invest all of our money into Vine."
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.100]   Which now as we know, 2019 is like extinct, gone.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.540]   People, you investing in your body, caring for your body.
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.300]   Wait, if you do that, if you make that your world,
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.040]   if you make that what your world is centered around,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   you're investing in something that is depreciating.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.640]   Here's the thing, we are left empty and insecure.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:34.920]   Because whether you have decided you're going to work hard
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.360]   to make your body look a certain way,
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.640]   or you've found a way to rationalize inside your mind,
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.960]   like, ah, just like doesn't matter what I look like.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.700]   I don't care what people think.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.800]   Both of those are leaving us broken and hurt and insecure.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.900]   It used to be magazines.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.480]   Used to be magazines, but all of us know
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.400]   those are like, you know, Photoshopped,
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.360]   electronically enhanced.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.780]   Now, it's your social media.
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.080]   Now it's your Instagram feed.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.000]   Now like the normal people in your life
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.320]   look better than you do, right?
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.960]   I mean, I don't know how everyone is so tan toned
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.940]   to eat pizza and like live in their like VW camper vans
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.780]   on a beach, right?
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.680]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.480]   Like what seems to be the normal,
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.360]   what's on your phone is proving to you,
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.860]   or it seems as if like that should be what I look like.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.000]   And I don't look like that.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.960]   What's wrong?
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.380]   Here's the thing.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.320]   If we are worshiping our bodies of God,
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.480]   we are finding our worth.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.200]   We find our worth in what we worship.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.920]   If what you worship is money,
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.040]   then the number in your bank account
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.560]   is where you're going to find your significance.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.920]   But if you worship your body and you find your worth
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.720]   in what you look like, it's dangerous
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.760]   'cause it's going down.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.280]   And here's a good way to tell if you have bought into this.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.440]   If you are worshiping your body as God,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.280]   if your mood changes,
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.640]   if your mood changes,
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.880]   if your mood changes,
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.840]   depending on like what you look like that day,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.000]   maybe like there's a pimple on your face
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.040]   and you're like, "Hey, what are you looking at?"
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.960]   And no one even knows it's there.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.160]   Maybe it's like you had a bad hair day
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.000]   or possibly it's a number on a scale.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.620]   If your mood changes because of either how you look like
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.560]   or a number on the scale,
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.120]   that is a telltale sign for you
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.240]   that you are worshiping your body
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.420]   as God.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.140]   Yeah, it just seems that there's really two responses
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.040]   to the world's message.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.320]   And that is those who accept it and those who avoid it.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.840]   And those of us who accept it,
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.320]   we make our life about working out
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.360]   and the way that our bodies look.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.620]   And those of us who avoid it, we just rationalize,
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.740]   but we're insecure.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.160]   Am I saying that it's wrong to be super fit?
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.260]   No, I'm not.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.800]   Am I saying that it's wrong to be comfortable
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.760]   in your own skin?
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.700]   No, but what I am saying is the Bible speaks
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.420]   to the heart behind both of them.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.140]   The Bible speaks, these verses speak to the heart
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.220]   behind both of them.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.260]   And so my second point is this,
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.220]   if the world says to worship our body as God,
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.520]   the word says to worship God with your body.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.020]   I'm literally just gonna read these verses again.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.860]   It says this, "Or do you not know that your body
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.900]   "is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.100]   "whom you have from God?"
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.100]   I don't think we get this, guys.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.800]   If you have trusted in Christ,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.400]   God has decided that your body is going to be the place
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.940]   where his spirit lives.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.040]   It says, "You are not your own,
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.540]   "for you were bought with a price,
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.380]   "so glorify God in your body."
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.700]   You see, God did not only created you and gave you your body,
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.840]   he bought you back at the infinite cost of his own son.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.700]   So he emphatically means for you to worship him
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.580]   with the body that he's given you.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.500]   And so what these verses are really saying
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.600]   is that how we care for our bodies is a stewardship issue.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.080]   Your body is not your own, it's a gift.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.320]   It's for God's glory and not for yours.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.180]   And we have a great responsibility to steward it.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.240]   You may be wondering, what is a steward?
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.080]   When I think about this,
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.360]   here's a good illustration for being a steward.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.760]   I have a 403B, which is 401K for pastors, okay?
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.360]   And if I went and found the guy that's investing my money,
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.960]   who's taking care of my 403B,
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.880]   and said, "Hey man, I'm here for my money."
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.040]   You got it, he's like, "Yeah, your money."
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.920]   Wow, where did I put that?
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.360]   Right, I think it's around here somewhere.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.920]   Like I would say, "Cool, I'm gonna take my money,
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.740]   "I'm going to have,
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.500]   "I'm going to give that to a different steward,
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.920]   "someone who is better at taking care of it.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.560]   "It's money that's not his,
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.060]   "but he is responsible for taking care of it."
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.400]   That's what I mean when I say
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.960]   that you are a steward of your body.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.120]   It's not your own,
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.460]   but you are responsible for caring for it.
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:53.520]   You're responsible for how you view it,
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.560]   for how you use it, how you treat it.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.400]   God made the body that you have.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.920]   Some of you need to know, when you think about this,
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.780]   there are ways in which you have not been excited
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.020]   on how God has made you.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.740]   And you need to know this, this is Psalm 139.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.740]   He says, "For you have formed my inward parts.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.980]   "You have knitted me together in my mother's womb.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.660]   "I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.220]   "Wonderful are your works.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.060]   "My soul knows it very well."
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.380]   Guys, you are the pinnacle of his creation.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.380]   When God made everything that you see,
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.580]   he said that you were the only ones made.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.400]   You and I as humans were made in his image.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.460]   The very best, all the beautiful things in this world
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.860]   that you've seen, the trees, the birds,
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.160]   everything that's amazing, he says,
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.900]   you are the very peak of that creation
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.060]   and you are beautiful and wonderfully made.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:57.180]   And he didn't mess up on you.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.300]   And he made us all different.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.580]   We look different, we have different abilities.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.140]   Friends, I know this very well.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.940]   I know that we look different,
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.780]   that we have different abilities.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.140]   Two friends of mine last year went to
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.300]   one of my favorite places in the world
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.140]   and it's called Havasu Falls.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.660]   Havasu Falls is a part of the Grand Canyon.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.220]   It's in Arizona and it's an incredible place
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.020]   and it's quite the hike to get down there.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.460]   It's about a 10-mile hike down, 10-mile hike out.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:31.140]   And both of these friends, they look different than I.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.780]   And so we are on the hike down, it's not so bad
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.820]   'cause we're headed down.
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.740]   On the way out though, my friend Andre is in the front
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.180]   and then my friend Ryan, and I noticed something.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.260]   I noticed that we have differing abilities
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.980]   because as they were walking,
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.180]   I was walking at exactly the same pace as they were,
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.180]   but I was losing about six inches every step, right?
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.180]   Like, I'm like, this is a problem, people,
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.600]   because now not only are my legs having to work
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.820]   to keep up with them, my lungs are dying, right?
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.380]   And so there's just a difference
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.520]   in the way that we were made, but that's okay.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.900]   Their worth, because they're made that way,
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.480]   isn't any more than mine.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.180]   God made all of us in his image.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.220]   God has made all of us in his image
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:15.220]   and God didn't give me their body to steward.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.740]   God didn't give me yours, he didn't give you theirs.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.740]   The person on your Instagram, he gave you yours
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.980]   in the way that he has made you
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.780]   is fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.220]   And you need to remember that.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.860]   Some of you just need to sit in that.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.980]   First Samuel 16, seven says that the man looks
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.860]   on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.700]   God cares about your health and fitness
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:48.220]   because the body he gave you is actually his.
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:54.420]   It's the only body that he's given you to serve him
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.540]   as much as you can, as long as you can.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.620]   And you are the only person in this world
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.980]   that can steward the body that you've got for God's glory
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.900]   and not something else.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.420]   And instead of making our bodies what we are worshiping,
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.020]   making our bodies God, the word says
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.160]   to worship God with your body.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.980]   Some of you might be thinking, man, Josh,
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.340]   I don't know, how do I do this?
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.180]   How do I do this?
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.300]   If it's really true that my body is not my own,
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.780]   that it was given to me by God for his glory
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.260]   and not my own, one, there's probably a view,
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.020]   the way in which you view your body tonight,
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.380]   I hope it changes.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.460]   Friends, I hope what you hear me saying
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.420]   is that I'm not mad or frustrated.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.380]   I'm not here to be angry at you
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.660]   or tell you that God's angry at you,
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.020]   but to tell you that your body is not yours.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.540]   It was made for God in his glory.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.780]   That could have an impact on some of you.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.700]   Some of you may need to get out of the gym.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.900]   Some of you may need to stop going to the gym
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.260]   because you are going there to make your body
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.020]   look a certain way so that you will gain affirmation
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:13.860]   from it.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.180]   And then some of you may need to get into the gym
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.340]   for the very first time because God cares.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.460]   God cares about your health and your fitness.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.860]   And he's given you a body to serve him
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.620]   as long as you can, as much as you can.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.060]   And so I want to be really practical with you guys tonight
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.740]   to give you a few ways in which you can do that.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.620]   A few just simple how-to's.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.900]   And the first one is this, is to train.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.460]   Train your body through movement.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.220]   Now, if you're in here tonight and you're a mailman
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.340]   and you walk 10 miles today, hey, good on you.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.180]   You're good.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.240]   You've used your body, you've moved your body today.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.080]   But if we're really honest,
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.900]   all of society has made a more inactive
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.140]   and sedentary lifestyle normal, right?
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.220]   A lot of us are sitting at a desk for most of the day
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.740]   and God did not design your body to be inactive.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.740]   He has actually designed it to move.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:12.160]   And so I can't tell you what type or how much,
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.820]   what type of workout or how much you need to work out
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.980]   that you would be a good sewer.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.900]   But I, and I'm not saying that it's required to work out
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.620]   to be a good sewer, but I am saying
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.980]   that if you leave your body inactive,
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.840]   you are being a bad steward.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.560]   It was never meant to be inactive.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.240]   And so for some of you,
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.960]   the most honoring thing that you can do tomorrow
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.960]   is to set your alarm, get up and go run a mile, right?
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.920]   Some of you, the most God honoring thing that you could do
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.580]   is to get up, spend time reading your Bible
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.200]   and remember that your identity and worth
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.180]   is not found in how your body looks.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.600]   So, I mean, I don't know what that looks like for you.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.140]   I can't tell you a good principle is three times a week.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.600]   Do that, just like start at three times a week.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.900]   Train your body through movement three times a week.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.880]   Find a movement or something,
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.140]   a workout that you like, that you enjoy.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.160]   Some of you might be like, man,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.620]   I don't even know what to do anymore.
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.560]   Like what kind of working out should I do?
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.080]   Is it, you know, should I run
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.560]   or should I do Pilates or any of that?
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.400]   Is it CrossFit?
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.840]   And yes, the answer is CrossFit.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.680]   I'm kidding.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.360]   But kind of, no.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.520]   But I am saying like, God has designed your body to move.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.040]   And when you leave it inactive,
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.880]   you are actually taking away from the health
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.840]   that God has meant for you to live in.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.120]   And you are not worshiping him as well as you could.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.420]   And the next one is this.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.440]   So if it train, train your body through movement.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.920]   The next one is this, eat with purpose.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.360]   Eat with purpose.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.080]   And here's what I mean by that is,
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.400]   we know that God's primary reason for food was for fuel,
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.440]   literally to keep us alive.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.200]   Like that is the primary reason,
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.800]   but he also made it for pleasure.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.520]   I mean, we all know how worshipful
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.760]   eating a honey butter chicken biscuit can be.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.920]   No, I need an amen, yes?
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.320]   Yeah, we know.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.160]   And that's okay.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.600]   And we know that meals often are a great time
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.440]   of like fellowship,
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.660]   like food is meant to bring enjoyment and pleasure,
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.500]   and that's a good thing.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.040]   But what I'm asking is that you eat on purpose.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.840]   That if every time, if you find yourself,
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.920]   every time you're in a certain mood,
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.760]   you're a little bit down,
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.400]   you're turning to Blue Bell ice cream.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.480]   Hey, that's maybe not it, right?
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.180]   To know how different foods affect your body.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.400]   And I would even go as far as just to say,
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   hey, eat more for fuel over pleasure,
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.040]   or even how it tastes.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.340]   Some of you are mad at me, including my wife.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.540]   Eat for fuel over pleasure.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.920]   Here's three principles there that I got told
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.800]   that have been helpful for me
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.680]   that could be helpful to you guys,
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.680]   and it's this, eat real food, not too much, mostly greens.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.880]   It's a great principle.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.480]   When you think about how you eat,
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.200]   eating on purpose in a way that it'll feel your body,
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   think about just eat real food, not too much, mostly greens.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.080]   And so train your body through movement.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.600]   Eat with purpose.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.340]   And then this last one is this, sleep.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.360]   Sleep, because your body needs it.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.480]   Yes, hey, we live, hey, our current culture
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.880]   is telling us, man, you've gotta get up,
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.280]   you've gotta be a hustler.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:37.940]   It's hard.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.700]   I am here, I will tell you that sleep is difficult for me.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.320]   There just seems like there's so many things,
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.600]   sometimes 'cause I'm just a little excited
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.080]   and I wanna do everything,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.880]   and then other times it's just because
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.920]   I believe it rests on my shoulders,
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.160]   that if I, like sleeping means
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.480]   something's not going to happen.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.360]   And so not only does your body need it,
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.360]   not only is that meant to be where your body recovers,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.600]   but it's a trust issue as well, people.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.080]   Like when you go to bed at night, it is a trust issue,
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.600]   knowing that if I go to sleep right now,
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.420]   even though all the world around me feels like
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.080]   I need to do all of these things,
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.960]   when I go to sleep, I'm telling God, like,
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.560]   hey, I know that you don't need me to do anything,
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.960]   that you're big enough, that you've got it under control.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.320]   And so sleep and sleep well.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.520]   Here's some of the ways that that played out for us
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.440]   in this ministry called, well,
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.160]   when we were thinking about eating on purpose,
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.720]   we did a sugar challenge.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   And some of you, this could be a good principle
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.040]   for you to start with tonight.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.080]   The sugar challenge is this, for 30 days,
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.120]   no sugar, literally that.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.840]   Okay, you didn't get to eat sugar, not 30 days, two weeks,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.140]   y'all thought I was crazy.
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.120]   Two weeks, no sugar, right?
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.400]   And then, and here's what it looked like,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.440]   if you ate sugar, if you showed up to group the next day
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.520]   and you had eaten sugar, it cost 10 burpees.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.400]   It didn't cost you 10 burpees,
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.360]   it cost everyone else 10 burpees.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.720]   And so you got to be that guy like, I'm sorry, team,
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.600]   the cake was awesome, right?
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.760]   But just that discipline, the discipline
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.760]   to stay away from sugar is incredibly hard.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.880]   And that could be a good thing just for you to start.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.600]   It's like, hey, I'm gonna go on a sugar fast.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.440]   I'm gonna tell my friends, hey,
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.640]   we're gonna go two weeks sugar fast.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.720]   At the end of that, we'll do as many burpees
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.220]   as many times as we ate sugar.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.480]   It's scary, try it.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.240]   Yeah, the other one is this, we had a sleep challenge.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.720]   We had a sleep challenge where we had to be in bed
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.700]   at least eight hours.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.200]   Eight hours, you guys are like, this is craziness.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.960]   And on top of that, not only you couldn't have any type
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.160]   of caffeine, including chocolate four hours
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.240]   before you went to bed, okay?
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.320]   And then you couldn't look at your phone four hours
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.840]   before you went to bed because that little blue light
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.640]   inside your phone, it actually stimulates your brain
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.400]   and keeps you awake.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.720]   And so we did a sleep challenge there
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.040]   that was just so helpful for me because one,
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.980]   I began to realize how attached to my phone I was.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.560]   And then also just through, I began to realize
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.840]   like how well I was not taking care of the body
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.500]   that God has given me because I just wasn't sleeping.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.040]   I just wasn't sleeping.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.180]   And so again, to run through this,
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.860]   you guys train through movement.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.400]   Don't be inactive, eat with purpose and sleep
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.600]   because your body needs it.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:29.520]   We worship God with our body when we understand
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.360]   that it is His.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.720]   It's where He abides.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.400]   Holy Spirit lives inside of us.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.360]   And so the way that we steward it,
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.920]   the way that we think about how we use it,
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.320]   it's no longer how it's going to make us feel
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.280]   or how it's going to make us look,
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.120]   but is it going to be honoring to God?
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.240]   I don't know what faithfulness looks like for you,
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.680]   but I am asking you to begin to understand
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.980]   that your body's a gift.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:01.720]   It is made by God, for God, it is made on purpose.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.320]   There's a show that I love to watch.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.320]   I bet many of you guys know, and it's called "The Voice."
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.200]   The Voice fans in here, yes, it's amazing.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.080]   In here, "The Voice" is incredible.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.980]   If you guys don't know, it's a show where people can come
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.560]   and use their voices to hopefully land deals
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.520]   with all of these famous people.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.760]   And it's pretty amazing because they've taken something
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.440]   away from the judges that's not normally taken away.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.240]   They got all of the judges,
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.000]   they're going to listen to this person sing,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.880]   but the judges are facing the opposite direction.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.240]   Like they can't see the person at all.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.200]   And so you've got, you know, Adam and Christina
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.560]   and Blake down there, like listening, like,
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.160]   "Hey, you guys, do you hear it, man?
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.800]   Wow, their voice is amazing."
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.120]   And you're going to touch your button,
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.360]   you're going to turn around,
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.680]   you're going to turn around and pick this person,
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.200]   say you want them on their team.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.960]   What's awesome about it is that it has nothing to do
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.120]   with their looks at all.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.960]   They don't know what they look like.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.280]   They just are, they're basing, if they want them,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.640]   on their abilities and what they can do and on their voice.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   And I think guys, that's similar to how God looks at us.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.580]   That's similar to how God treats us.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.840]   It's not about the way that we look.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.680]   He doesn't, he's not worried about us on the outside.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.720]   What has actually happened is God knows you,
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.480]   has made you in his image.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.160]   And because he loves you, because he wants you,
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   he has hit the button and turned around on you
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.220]   to choose you.
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:34.560]   And if you don't know, if you don't know this God,
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.100]   this God that has made you in his image, I want you to.
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:44.360]   He's made you because he loves you.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:49.920]   And even though we, all of us are broken,
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.640]   it's the greatest love story ever
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.540]   because in the midst of when God made us,
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.880]   we at one point in our lives said,
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.160]   "Hey God, I know you made us to be
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.500]   "in a right relationship with you,
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.440]   "but we're gonna choose to go our own ways."
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.560]   And this really amazing, terrible thing happened.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.400]   It's sin, sin entered the world
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.900]   and it broke the relationship you and I
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.280]   were meant to have with God.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.880]   It's what causes our relationship with our bodies
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.560]   to be broken is this thing called sin.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.880]   And the Bible tells us that all of us have sinned
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.920]   and that sin deserves death.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.560]   But then God, in his love for us, sent his only son
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.360]   to come and live on this earth, to live perfectly.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.880]   And then for all the ways that we have sinned against him,
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.880]   to die on a cross, literally a robber's death,
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.860]   he carried the sin.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:42.080]   He bore the sin, he paid for the sin on the death
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.480]   when he died on the cross and he rose again
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.280]   three days later, conquering the death
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.440]   so that you and I can be restored
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   back into a right relationship with God.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.520]   That's the God that's made you in his image.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.440]   That's the God that's given you,
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.440]   each of you, your unique body.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.600]   And he has made you to glorify him in it.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.400]   The world says that you are at the center of your body
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.280]   and its image is your value.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:19.480]   God's word says that God has made you in his image
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.880]   and that you are invaluable.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.120]   I'm gonna pray for us.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.920]   Father, we are thankful for you.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:37.840]   And I just ask that you would open the eyes of our hearts,
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.600]   Father, to recognize your incredible love for us
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.120]   and our deep and desperate need for you.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.440]   And Father, I repent of the ways in which I have treated
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.300]   and used my body for my own glory and not for you.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.400]   And I pray for all of my friends in this room,
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.240]   Father, that maybe if this is the first time
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.120]   that they have recognized or heard and understood
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.600]   that, man, this body, this temple that you've given them
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.080]   is not meant for their glory, but for yours,
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.300]   Father, just change their hearts.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.680]   And may we be people that are identified,
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.460]   not in how we look, but are identified
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.800]   by the love that you have given us.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.700]   You have died on the cross and now,
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.600]   if we have put our faith in Jesus,
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.480]   you now identify us as sons and daughters.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.280]   Thank you again for this evening
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.240]   and the fact that we can open your word up freely
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.160]   and we can begin to learn how you would have us live.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:37.360]   It's in your holy and precious name that I pray, amen.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.520]   - Man, thank you, Josh.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.160]   It was awesome and encouraging.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.960]   And from just a brother who spent years
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.880]   helping people experience what God wants us to experience
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.800]   as it relates to wellness and health,
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.440]   not for the sake of vanity,
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.760]   but for the sake of bringing honor to him
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.520]   and experiencing part of the abundant life that's here.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.400]   Some of you in the room,
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.960]   the most important thing that you need
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.460]   to walk away with tonight
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.420]   is not that you need to wake up tomorrow morning
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.080]   and go do CrossFit or go do Camp Gladiator
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.380]   or go do whatever is in your regimen.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.760]   It's that you need to stop focusing on the outside
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.360]   because there is a hole on the inside
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.320]   that you have never addressed.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.400]   And you have tried to fill it with different substances,
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.400]   with different people, with working out, with money.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.920]   And it is a hole that God, the eternal creator,
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.600]   said, "I placed eternity in the hearts of men,"
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.480]   Ecclesiastes chapter three said.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.040]   A hole that God placed inside of you
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.680]   so that you would reach out and find him.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.240]   And the thing more than anything else that you need tonight
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   is not an encouragement to go get fit
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.720]   and let's all get a six pack in 2019.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.040]   What you need is to accept the free gift
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.560]   that the God who is so crazy about you,
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.520]   that he gave his own life for you,
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.600]   despite everything that he knows,
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.160]   everything broken about you, it's no mystery to him.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.920]   And yet before you ever breathed your first breath,
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.940]   he was reaching out arms for you.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.040]   It is the thing you came into this world
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.520]   craving, needing, wanting most.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.080]   It is the thing that on your dying deathbed
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.200]   with your last breaths, you will most need.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.600]   And tonight is your night.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.880]   And he's offering the eternal gift,
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.280]   the gift of eternal life, if you will just by faith.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.240]   Say, "God, I'm not trusting in what I do.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.680]   "I'm not trusting how good I am.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.760]   "I'm trusting in Jesus.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.340]   "I got no shot but him."
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.640]   And if you're ever gonna experience eternal life
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.840]   and the abundant life in this planet,
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.320]   it won't happen by you going to 24-hour fitness more.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.480]   It's gonna happen by you walking with Jesus.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.180]   And that is the message you need to walk away with tonight.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.720]   Others of you, you don't need to accept the truth
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.720]   'cause you already have.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.040]   But you have bought in some of the lies
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.500]   that the world is selling you every single day.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.680]   Lies about who you are, lies about where your worth is,
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.600]   lies about what beauty is, and you hate yourself.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.800]   And you look amazing.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.300]   On the outside, no one would ever know it.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.560]   You got it all together.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.160]   You're the prettiest girl or handsome,
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.760]   most handsome guy in your whole crew.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.280]   And you're the person crushing every workout regimen.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.880]   But you have bought lies
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.960]   as it relates to where your value is.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.480]   And tonight, the challenge,
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.160]   and everything in addition to what Josh said,
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.680]   which was so encouraging and so helpful,
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.240]   what you need to do is speak the truth to yourself.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.400]   You need to speak the truth.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.460]   Some of you, I don't know what that is,
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.920]   but from God's word, there's different truths
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.560]   that really are the things that you need
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.700]   to rehearse in your mind and replay
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.520]   over and over and over and over again.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.440]   'Cause we live in a world
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.920]   that as soon as you walk outside of these doors,
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.680]   they're gonna say, this is what beauty looks like,
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.960]   this is where worth is found,
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.280]   this is what you should look like for,
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.720]   or look for in a spouse,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.760]   and look like it if you're gonna get a spouse.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.900]   And you need to speak the truth.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.640]   There is power when you speak the truth.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.200]   Whether it is you rehearsing
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.240]   in the face of sin, temptation, or shame,
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.980]   I am the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.440]   That's who I am.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.340]   Whether it is you saying,
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.080]   hey, I am fearfully and wonderfully made,
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.600]   I'm not gonna find my value in the number on a scale,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.640]   I'm not gonna find my value
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.700]   in what some guy thinks of me,
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.860]   I'm not gonna find my value
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.160]   with the world and the Oscars
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.480]   and what everyone needs to look like,
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.560]   that's not where I find it
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.000]   because all that's there is emptiness.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.400]   One of the things that even in the porch
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.000]   that we week after week see,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.520]   for whatever reason God is entrusted in,
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.940]   hold on, just a platform where different people
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.560]   at different stages and different successful spheres
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.920]   are connected to this ministry
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.960]   or have been encouraged by it
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.080]   and will reach out in different things
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.120]   and over and over and over again,
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.300]   despite the fact that they have
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.480]   everything you would ever want in life,
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.720]   despite the fact they look like everything
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.160]   everyone would ever want to look like,
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.280]   they're saying, I'm empty, I'm empty,
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.520]   and I feel like I'm finding hope
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.400]   because I'm finding Jesus.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.060]   And you need to speak the truth to yourself.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.040]   When you wake up tomorrow
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.280]   and you are tempted to binge and purge again,
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.880]   you are tempted to hate what you see in the mirror.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.000]   I am fearfully and wonderfully made,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.020]   my God makes no mistakes.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.560]   Whatever was said about me in the fourth grade
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.400]   that I've carried around,
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.560]   I'm big bone and big shoulders,
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.840]   I refuse to let that define me anymore.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.160]   My God has made me,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.840]   he makes no mistakes.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.140]   And I'm gonna embrace who I am,
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:08.980]   I'm gonna know who I am,
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:09.820]   I'm gonna like who I am,
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.000]   I'm gonna be who I am.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.120]   'Cause if God is gonna use you,
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.160]   he's gonna use you as you trying to be you.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.040]   Not you trying to be me,
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.320]   not you trying to look like her,
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.360]   not you trying to look like him
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.000]   or trying to be anybody else.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.840]   And you need to speak the truth to yourself.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.520]   There is power when we speak the truth.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.520]   This is who I am.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.880]   And then finally, there's some of you
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.400]   who you're walking alone.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.540]   And I don't know what goals
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.940]   or what you're trying to accomplish,
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.040]   but I know this, it is not likely to happen
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.520]   if you don't have others in your life.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.440]   Whether it is, I mean,
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.760]   you could just see the worldly example.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.440]   The reason CrossFit has this like crazy
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.560]   cult following with it
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.960]   is 'cause they all kind of come together
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.880]   and it's like, hey, I'm in.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.840]   Where were you, Barry?
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.720]   And it's just, we're all circling together.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.080]   That is how you were designed to live.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.320]   And that's what the Christian life is all about.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.320]   That God didn't say it's for CrossFit.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.600]   The reason CrossFit's so popular
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.220]   is because God, from the beginning of creation,
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.320]   said it's not good to be alone
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.600]   and you're meant to have others in your life
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.200]   and you don't have those people.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.100]   And you're not gonna experience
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.260]   the abundant health that God wants.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.500]   You're not gonna experience a soul care that God wants
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.420]   if you don't have other people.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.140]   So tonight, there's a chance for you
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.940]   to take the next step and get plugged into community.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.780]   You can go right down this hall if you're a guy.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.640]   You can get in a circle with other guys
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.740]   that are just like you,
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.420]   that don't have people walking alongside of them.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.420]   And you'll take that step towards health
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.780]   in lots of directions,
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.820]   primarily on the inside,
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.160]   but also it often leads,
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.660]   discipline has this weird thing where it's contagious.
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.100]   When a discipline shows up in your life,
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.340]   it's like it invites its friends.
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.380]   And you become more disciplined and more disciplined.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.960]   And you can step towards that tonight
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.840]   with other people in your life.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.100]   If you're a girl, you can go right down this hall
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.860]   and get connected with other girls
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.800]   to walk alongside of you.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.640]   And finally,
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.960]   I know there's some that are here
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.300]   that are walking through,
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.940]   man, you have just bought the lies
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.860]   and you don't even know where the truth, where to turn.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.320]   As a dad of a daughter,
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.120]   I have become so much more aware
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.520]   and so much more cognizant.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.000]   And I'll speak just to the ladies
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   of how many lies day after day after day are fed.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.240]   Dude, this is what you should look like ladies.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.120]   And it's a lie.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.520]   And I also am highly aware the same lies are fed
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.040]   to the men about where your worth is found
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.840]   and what kind of woman you should look for.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.120]   And you may not have anyone to turn to.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.380]   You may be like, man, I feel like I'm,
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.040]   I just can't get out of this rut.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.420]   We would love to pray with you,
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.020]   come alongside of you,
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.220]   connect with you at whatever degree you're interested.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.580]   And we have an entire team that'll be down front
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.220]   that would love to serve you in any way that you can.
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.540]   Whether it's about tonight's message,
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.300]   maybe you just have an uncle who's sick
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.500]   and you just want someone to pray for you.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.780]   We'd love to pray for you, answer questions,
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.300]   recommend a good restaurant next,
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.580]   anything that we can do to serve you,
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.740]   we would love to do.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.820]   But for the rest of you guys,
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:54.820]   that's all that we have tonight.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.660]   We love y'all.
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.100]   Go in peace to love and serve the Lord this week.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.100]   (audience cheering)
