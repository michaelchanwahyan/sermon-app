00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Hey, hey, alright porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Good to be here in Dallas and say hello to our friends in Houston and Fort Worth and other places that are tuning in.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Man, it is awesome to be together.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 My name is Todd and I get to hang out with you for a little bit tonight.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 We're talking about BC, man, before Christ.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Stories that happened before the man that all of history pivoted on shows up.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 And I just want to start by just saying it's a little crazy sometimes when you read some of these stories.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 If you haven't been tuning in with us these last couple of weeks, you heard a story about some old goat

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 went around the desert that God appeared to and said, "Quit worshipping what you're worshipping, come know me."

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And later that man had a son when he was about 100 years old and that son was supposed to be offered

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 as a sacrifice of faith by him.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And right when that old man got ready to kill his son, some other old goat, a ram, was caught in some thicket and was delivered.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 That sounds crazy.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And from that guy and that son, all the nations of the world were supposed to be blessed.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 That sounds crazy.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 It sounds crazy that even before that guy, there was another guy that was living on the earth

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 and the earth was becoming very wicked and God chose him to build an ark in the middle of a desert

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 before a flood came and judged the whole world.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And that the whole world would eventually be destroyed and yet God would use that guy

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 who proclaimed the coming judgment of God, if people trusted in him,

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 they would move towards that instrument of wood which he built that when the judgment came

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 they'd be raised up in and saved in.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Sounds crazy.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 A little bit later there's a story about a young guy that God chose when he was out there in the desert

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 tending a flock of sheep and he said, "I'm going to make you king over my people.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I'm going to make you considered great. I'm going to use you to defeat a giant,

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 a guy that's nine foot plus tall and intimidated entire armies.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I'm going to use you to take him down and I'm going to use you to remind my people how great I am."

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 That story sounds crazy.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 That's what I don't like about the Bible. It's full of crazy stories.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I mean, like, think about this.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 What if I told you this story, that there was the most powerful nation in the history of the world.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Economically, militarily wise, it was just thriving, it was prospering, it was kicking it like no other nation ever had.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And 18 men were going to come attack this nation and just cripple it economically.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 They were going to penetrate its fortress of military strength.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 It was going to shut down all commerce.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 These 18 men were going to take down this huge national force of economic power and military strength.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 If I told you that 18 guys did that, you'd go, "That's what I don't like about your Bible, Todd.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 That's a ridiculous story."

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And yet, if you were tuning in September 11, 2001, that's exactly what happened.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 That in history, 18 men shut this country down.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 They melted the symbols of economic strength and power, the World Trade Center.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 They penetrated the fortress, which represents our worldwide military strength,

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 and our nation was paralyzed and in fear.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 That's just 15 years ago in history.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And it flat sounds crazy if you tell it a certain way looking back.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 The Bible's filled with crazy stories.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I'm going to tell you one of the craziest ones tonight.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I'm going to tell you that there's some lesson in there for you.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I'm going to introduce it to you by just giving you a riddle.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 This is a riddle that some guy that apparently had more money than sense had put word out

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 that if anybody could come up with a puzzle or a riddle that they themselves had created

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 that he couldn't answer, he would give them $1,000.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 This was decades ago, and that was a lot of money.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And so some woman entered this particular riddle into the contest,

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 and the guy couldn't solve it.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 I want to see if you can solve it, and we'll give you a prize.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 What are we going to give them, David?

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Entrance to launch.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Are we going to do that?

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 We're not, but we're going to give you the riddle anyway.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 All right?

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Here's the riddle.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 "Adam, God made out of dust, but he thought best to make me first.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So I was made before man to answer God's most holy plan.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 A living being I became, and Adam gave to me my name.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I from his presence withdrew, and more from Adam never knew.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 I did my maker's law obey, nor ever from it went astray.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Thousands of miles I go each year, but seldom on earth do I appear.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 For purpose-wise, which God did see, he put a living soul in me,

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 a soul from God, I did claim, and God from me took the soul again.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 So when from me the soul had fled, I was the same as when first made,

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 and without hands, feet, or soul, I travel on from pole to pole.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 I labor hard by day, by night.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 To fallen men I give great light.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Thousands of people, young and old, will by my death great light behold.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 No right or wrong can I conceive.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 The scripture I cannot believe.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Although my name is there and found, they are to me an empty sound.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 No fate of death doth trouble me.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Real happiness I'll never see.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 To heaven I will never go, nor will I go to hell below.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Now when these lines you slowly read, go search your Bible with all speed,

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 for that my name is written there, I do honestly to you declare.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Now that, my friends, is brilliant, especially when you know the answer.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Anybody who has never heard that before, have any idea,

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 maybe somebody who didn't know what we were talking about tonight,

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 have any idea what the answer to that could be?

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 What do you got out there?

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Is that wisdom?

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Holy Spirit?

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 No, no, and no.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 The answer is a whale.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Now listen again.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Adam God made out of dust, but he thought best to make me first.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 If you know anything about Genesis, the order of creation,

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 the animals and the sea creatures were made first.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 So I was made before man to answer God's most holy plan.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 A living being I became, and Adam gave to me his name.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 You guys know Adam named all the animals.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I from his presence withdrew from Adam's presence withdrew,

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 and more from Adam never knew.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Adam never taught me anything again.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 I did my maker's law obey, nor ever from it went astray.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Thousands of miles I go each year, but seldom on earth do I appear.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 For purpose wise, which God did see, he put a living soul in me.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Now we're getting to the story.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Yeah.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 You see why it was safe to offer you guys not just the launch this year,

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 but a new car and a million dollars.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Sorry no one got it.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 But listen to this.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 This is really great.

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 A soul from me God did claim and took from me that soul again.

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 So when from me the soul had fled, I was made the same as when first made.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And without hands, now feet, or soul, I travel on from pole to pole.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I labor hard by day by night to fall in men I give great light.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Now that one might be kind of hard.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Why?

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Do you know that what they would use to make light is they would burn blubber, whale oil.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Yeah, exactly.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Thousands of people, young and old, will buy my death, great light, behold.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 No right or wrong can I conceive.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 The scripture I cannot believe.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Although my name therein is found, they are to me an empty sound.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 No fate of death to trouble me, real happiness I'll never see.

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 To heaven I will never go, nor will I go to hell below.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Animals don't have a soul, don't have that kind of judgment.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 They're here and gone, not like you.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Pay attention tonight.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Now when these lines you slowly read, go search your Bible, we'll all speed for that.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 My name is written there, I do honestly to you declare it.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 We're talking about a whale.

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 No we're not, we're talking about the story of Jonah and the answer to the riddle, the whale.

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 But here's a riddle for you.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Why does God care so much, or does God care so much about you?

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Especially if you coming in here tonight know just how wrong you are in the way you live.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 You, unlike the whale who does whatever God tells him to do, don't do at all what God tells you to do and you well know it.

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And you are somebody that is very far from God and the question is, does God care about you?

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And I'm going to show you the answer to that tonight.

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And I'm also going to show you the answer to this.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Let's say by some miraculous story of grace you have come to know already that God loves you and cares for you.

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Are you fully engaged in the way that God wants you to be engaged with the truth that you have come to know?

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 So we're going to read the story of Jonah and the whale.

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 It's a crazy story.

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 But what you're going to find out is this isn't really a story that is to be discussed about whether it is allegorical or whether it's a parable.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 An allegory is a story that everything means anything and it has lots of different meanings to it.

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 A parable is that there is some meaning to the story but not what's there right immediately on the surface of it.

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Or is it historical?

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 To understand what the genre is, genre as you guys know because you're edumacated, is just a way to talk about what kind of literature something is.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Is it poetical? Is it allegorical? Is it historical narrative?

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 What genre is Jonah? Should we believe it as a story that is really true?

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 It's not really a question of literature.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 It's a question of who you think Jesus is because Jesus, I will tell you at the very end of our time tonight,

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 compares his life and the final miracle authenticating who he was to this story.

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And if you believe Jesus is who he says he was, if you believe there is a BC and an AD,

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 if you believe there is a year of our Lord where everything pivots, all of human history pivots,

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 then you better believe that Jesus knew what he was talking about when he said that there was a Noah.

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Do you know that Jesus talked about Noah?

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And so it's not whether the story of Noah could possibly happen, it's whether Jesus could possibly be who he claimed to be.

162
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Do you know that it's not crazy to think that all of humanity came from an Adam and an Eve,

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 two people created in the image of God?

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 It's really a question of do you believe Jesus is who he said he is because Jesus said God created an Adam and an Eve.

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 It's not really a question of whether or not an old man in the desert wandering around could actually have implications on your life

166
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 because Jesus said that this old man Abraham has implications on your life.

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 It's not really a question of whether David existed and slayed a giant because Jesus believed that David existed.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So all these stories that we talk about in this before Christ, we don't have to really wonder too much about.

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 We've got to answer just one question.

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Who is Jesus? What was he doing on the cross?

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And when he came off that cross, was he dead?

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And if he was dead, how in the world did he live again?

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Because if it's true that Christ is God and he died for me,

174
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 and that he predicted his own death and his own means of defeating death

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 as a sign that he was a man who did not owe any obligation to sin's wages, which is death,

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 then you better pay attention to him.

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 For me, I decide the story of Jonah and the whale is true

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 because I don't make it a habit of arguing with guys who walk on water,

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 call in the wind and the waves, give blind sight, and are risen from the grave.

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I happen to go, "Those guys might know something I don't."

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And so what I want to really talk with you tonight about is this story,

182
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 and I'm going to take it for what Jesus says it was,

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 which is as a historical revelation anticipating an even greater resurrection.

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 So here's one question we might ask ourselves.

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Is it possible that a whale could swallow a human being?

186
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Now, I'm no expert in marine biology, but I have done some research.

187
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 My buddy and I, when we every now and then take our wives away for vacation,

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 we go down sometimes to Mexico, and when we go to Mexico,

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 we are in Cabo, oftentimes when whales are down there,

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 we've just made a habit of grabbing snorkels and fins,

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 and when we see a whale coming down the shore, we just hook it out there in the ocean.

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Now, about five years ago, we got out, and we thought we could get near a whale,

193
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 and we got out there near this humpback, and here's a picture of my buddy and I out in the ocean with a whale.

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Now, what's wild--no, not that one, the one before that, you can clearly see the whale.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 What's--nope, nope, the original one, where there's two heads and a big whale right next to us.

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 That's the one we want to show first as we talk.

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 You'll see it in just a moment.

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 But anyway, in that particular picture where there's two of us with this whale that is there--

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 maybe the picture didn't make it to you--

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 we actually didn't see the whale this particular time.

201
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 It surfaced about 15 feet from us in this giant in the ocean that was near us.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 We completely missed.

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 It was just that quiet. Nope, that's not the one. Don't even try it.

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 We'll get to those in a minute.

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Appreciate you trying, though. All right?

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 So anyhow, that whale that was out there, we missed.

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Now, a couple years later, we get back out.

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Now, let me just show you this about whales.

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 This is how big whales are.

210
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Here's a slide with all different kinds of whales, all right?

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And you can see that they're anywhere from 69 to 90 feet if you're dealing with a blue whale,

212
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 or a humpback, which is the whale I swim out there sometimes to see,

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 because that's what--or out there are 42 to 50 feet.

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Just to give you an idea, okay?

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 A school bus is about 37 feet long.

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 So here's a school bus, you know, behind me, okay?

217
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 These whales are anywhere from the middle of that IMAG here in Dallas

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 to the middle of that IMAG in Dallas.

219
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Here's a picture of a diver. This is a true story.

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 There was a whale that was caught off the coast of California not long ago

221
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 in a bunch of crab nets.

222
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 It was weighted down. It couldn't get up to breathe.

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And a fisherman saw it, and it radiated into a bunch of environmentalists.

224
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And they went out, and they realized the only way they were going to save this whale is to cut it free.

225
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And so they took a bunch of knives, and they cut the netting off this whale.

226
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And when the whale was freed up, it swam around them with circles of joy.

227
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 The one guy said when he was cutting that last bit of netting off its mouth,

228
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 he said that eye of that whale just watched him, every move he made.

229
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And then it went, and just when it was cut free completely,

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 swam circles of joy, and it said it went up to every single diver and nudged it.

231
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Here's one last picture. I know. I know.

232
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 So here's one last picture that was taken of one diver with that particular humpback whale.

233
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Now that is an amazing picture.

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 What I want you to see is the size of that human next to that humpback whale,

235
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 giving a big humpback one to the guy.

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And so that mouth on that humpback whale, though,

237
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 goes almost all the way down to where its dorsal fin is.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Now a couple years later, when I was with my buddy and we swam out,

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 we saw this humpback whale, and we did get close.

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Here's the pictures that, my fault, I didn't get these squared away earlier,

241
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 but this is me and my buddy out in the ocean.

242
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 My wife was on the shore with a camera, and she was taking pictures.

243
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 There we are, and we see a whale coming.

244
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 You'll start to see it now in the second picture, move a little bit closer towards us.

245
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And you can see the ripples. That whale started to dive.

246
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 So we dove, and this was the picture she had when there was nothing there.

247
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 She told me, "Look, if you guys get swallowed, I'm going to get a massage

248
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 before I haul your little butts back to the States."

249
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 But anyway, when that thing came up and was gone,

250
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I actually had a chance with this whale as it came by.

251
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I waited for that dorsal fin to go by me and just got close enough

252
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 where I saw the size of that mouth.

253
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 The mouth itself, if that whale was 60 feet long, was 25 feet long.

254
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 There's no question that thing could have swallowed me up.

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Now here's the question.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 If a whale swallowed a man whole, by the way, they found a whale not many years ago

257
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 that had swallowed a 450-pound giant squid whole.

258
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 450 pounds.

259
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And it was later killed, that particular whale, and it was not yet digested.

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And they were just amazed at the ability of these animals that typically eat krill

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 and just run it through its system and process it that way,

262
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 had swallowed something like a giant squid.

263
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 All that to say, I've seen a whale up close.

264
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Let me just tell you, it can swallow you.

265
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 But here's the deal.

266
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Could you live, if you were in the belly of a whale, three days like Jonah was?

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I'm going to make a case that Jonah didn't need to live for three days

268
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 in the belly of a whale.

269
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I'm going to make a case that it wouldn't surprise me at all if he died.

270
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And God raised him from the dead three days later when he was regurgitated by that whale.

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 I don't really need to figure it out.

272
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 I guess if God wanted him to be in that first little stomach,

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 and scientists will tell you that different amounts of food are moved in different directions,

274
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 that Jonah, for whatever reason, was not processed by that whale

275
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 and was three days in the deep, Jesus said, not just Jonah in the story.

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 It's in the Old Testament, but Jesus said, I'm going to give you a sign.

277
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 It's going to be the sign of Jonah,

278
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 that a man will be three days in the deep, in the dark,

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 and will raise again to proclaim to you amazing news.

280
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Now, here's something else that's kind of crazy,

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 is that the people that Jonah was told to go and share the story of repentance with,

282
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 that there was a God that does exist in the heavens,

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 that people are going to have to do business with,

284
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 he was called to go to the Ninevites.

285
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 The Ninevites were the most awful people in the face of the earth.

286
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 They were the enemies of the nation of Israel,

287
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 and Jonah knew that God was merciful,

288
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 and he wanted nothing to do with that message going to those Assyrians.

289
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Assyrians were notoriously evil.

290
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 They were, in fact, the very first well-known terrorists.

291
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 They didn't just seek to conquer lands.

292
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 They sought to conquer lands by terror.

293
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 They would run poles through their enemies,

294
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 up through their backside, through their gill, if you will,

295
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 their jaw, and they would use them to light their way.

296
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 They would take the skins of their enemies,

297
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 and they would use them to provide further rain, if you will,

298
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 resistance to their tents.

299
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 They would cut the heads off their enemies,

300
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 and they would stack them up like cannonballs in pyramids.

301
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 And they wouldn't just defeat you.

302
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 They would terrorize you.

303
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And they were hated by all nations, feared by all nations,

304
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 and Jonah, when he heard word that God wanted him to go and proclaim

305
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 the message of forgiveness and redemption and reconciliation to him,

306
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Jonah said, "I'm not going there."

307
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Whether he was scared to go there

308
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 or whether he just didn't want those enemies to experience grace,

309
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 it doesn't matter.

310
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 He decided to go the opposite direction.

311
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Let's read the story of Jonah,

312
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 and I think you're going to find some application

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 that will encourage you tonight.

314
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Jonah 1 says, "The word of the Lord came to Jonah, saying,

315
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 'Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry against it,

316
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 for their wickedness has come up before me.'"

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I just want to stop and make a couple of quick observations here

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 because in every little bit of Scripture,

319
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 there's something there for you because a lot of people kind of go,

320
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 "Well, man, I'm not like Jonah. This doesn't really apply to me."

321
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I want to let you know this,

322
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 that there is a responsibility for anybody

323
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 that the word of the Lord has come to.

324
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Having received grace and mercy,

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 having received from God revelation,

326
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 you are necessarily given with that reception some responsibility.

327
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 There's a great question that people often ask.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 "Hey, well, what about people that have never heard the story of Jesus Christ?

329
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 The Bible says there's no other name under heaven by which men must be saved.

330
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And so what about the un-evangelized heathen?

331
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Has anybody ever hit you up with that one?

332
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 What about those that have never heard?

333
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Is there any way that they can be saved?"

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And sometimes people ask that question because they're trying to figure out,

335
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 "Hey, if there's a loophole for that guy, maybe there's a loophole for me."

336
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And by the way, even if there's no loophole for that guy,

337
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I think God's unjust if he's going to judge people who are condemned

338
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 because they've rejected a Jesus in whom they've never heard.

339
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 There was a guy who was a great communicator who lived about 150, 160 years ago.

340
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 His name was Spurgeon.

341
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And Spurgeon was asked the question, "What about the un-evangelized heathen?

342
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Can they be saved?"

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And Spurgeon's response, I thought, was brilliant.

344
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 By the way, if you're not familiar with a little resource we create around here

345
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 called Real Truth Real Quick, we've answered that question.

346
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So in five minutes, you can just Google "un-evangelized heathen," "real truth real quick,"

347
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 or "Todd Wagner, un-evangelized heathen."

348
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Those two things sometimes go together.

349
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And you'll get a little five-minute response on a biblical perspective on that answer.

350
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 But let me give you this answer tonight,

351
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 because I thought it was brilliant what Spurgeon said when he was asked that question.

352
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Spurgeon said, "To me, it's a much greater question.

353
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Can those of us who have heard the gospel

354
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 and refuse to share it with those who have not heard it really be saved?"

355
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Let me say that again.

356
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 You know, sometimes when people ask you that question,

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 what they're really looking for is a loophole themselves, like,

358
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 "Hey, maybe if that guy gets off, I can get off."

359
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And let me just tell you, the person who's asking you that question,

360
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 whatever is true of the un-evangelized heathen isn't true of them,

361
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 or they wouldn't be asking the question.

362
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 But I'll just give you a little insight real quick.

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 The Bible never says that there's anybody anywhere that would be judged

364
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 because they've rejected a Jesus who's never heard.

365
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 The Bible also says that God is just.

366
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And the Bible does still say that that person who's never heard of Jesus is under judgment

367
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 because of their own conscience they violate,

368
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 and because of the truth they suppress and righteousness revealed by God in all of creation.

369
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 But I will tell you this, if you really care about the un-evangelized heathen,

370
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 the greatest thing that you can do is respond to the message of grace yourself

371
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 and then start to do something about getting the message to them.

372
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Here's what Jonah chapter 1, verse 1 says.

373
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Jonah chapter 1, verse 1 says, "The word of the Lord came to Jonah."

374
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 As soon as the word of the Lord came to Jonah, he was a prophet.

375
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And when this happens, you have great responsibility.

376
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And it doesn't really matter whether or not you like the people that the message is supposed to go to.

377
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 God calls you to love them.

378
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 In fact, he calls you to suffer for them that they may know.

379
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And in fact, the more you suffer to take the message to them,

380
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 the more it's a sign for them about how much God loves them.

381
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 This is what was said of Paul when he was talking to the people that were in a certain town at that day called Ephesus.

382
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And he just said to them, he said, "Hey man, listen.

383
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Don't you lose heart when you hear about my tribulations, for they are your glory."

384
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 In other words, when you see how much God wants me to suffer just so you can get the message of redemption,

385
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 don't you worry about that.

386
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 In fact, it ought to be a constant reminder of how much God loves you.

387
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 The Bible tells us when we look at how much God loves us,

388
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 that he would take his only begotten son, who is eternally dwelt in glory with the rest of the Godhead,

389
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 and he would not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself.

390
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 In other words, he didn't stop being God, but he stopped holding on to his ability to act in a way that his divine, eternal perfection demands and deserves.

391
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And he humbled himself, and he found himself in the appearance of a man, and being made in the image of a man,

392
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 he became obedient even to the point of death.

393
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Why? Because God is a just God.

394
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 He in fact will judge sin, but he's a loving God, and so he wants to justify those who deserve judgment.

395
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 God solves this problem by letting himself in the person of his son,

396
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 which is the visible image of the invisible God, go through unspeakable horrors for you.

397
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And when we see what Christ went through, it's two things.

398
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 It makes you wonder what kind of love is this, and it makes you wonder how valuable are those people that God gave his son for.

399
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 When you look at who the Ninevites were in history, and you see what God's going to do with his prophet,

400
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 now Jonah was not just any prophet. Jonah was already kicking it.

401
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 He had already been faithful as a prophet to Israel.

402
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 His name is mentioned in 2 Kings chapter 14 as the guy who had done his job,

403
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 and God took this effective, faithful prophet, and he said, "Hey, guess what?

404
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I don't just love folks who speak Hebrew. I love those folks over there that are worshiping, guess what? Dagon.

405
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Who is Dagon? He is the fish God."

406
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And so even in Jonah's rebellion, you're going to watch how God works Jonah's rebellion for good

407
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 as a way to either further confirm his message to the Assyrians.

408
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Now, God didn't want Jonah to rebel, but God's going to work all things for good to those who love God

409
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 and are called according to his purpose.

410
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Jonah just happened to go through a little bit more heartache because he didn't obey God outright.

411
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 When the word of the Lord comes to you, you are a prophet.

412
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And I don't really want to hear anything about how you don't think you're gifted,

413
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 how you don't think that you're capable.

414
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 If the word of the Lord comes to you, you are his prophet.

415
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And if you have profited from the word of God, you carry with that prophet a necessary obligation to help others.

416
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 The reason that you are blessed is to be a blessing,

417
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 not so you can scoff at those who do not have what you have.

418
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And by the way, you know that if you're blessed, it means you've received something you don't deserve.

419
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And so the last thing you want to do is look at arrogance with others who didn't receive what you have received.

420
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 The word grace in Greek is the word charis, C-H-A-R-I-S.

421
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 It's where we get the English word charity,

422
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 which means you receive something that you don't earn or deserve.

423
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 And so when you look at other people who don't have what you have,

424
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 the last thing you should do is go, "Well, how come you don't have what I have

425
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 when you have what you have because it was a gift?"

426
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 All we are is individuals who as beggars have received bread that we didn't earn or deserve,

427
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 and what any beggar who has received something they don't deserve should do

428
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 is to tell other people who are hungry where they can receive it.

429
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 I don't ever get discouraged when I come up against people who don't know the kindness of God

430
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 and the goodness of who He is because frankly, I'm not really sure how in my arrogance

431
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 and in my self-sufficiency and in my general prosperity and blessed way

432
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 have come to a point in my life where I really understood my need for God.

433
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Other than this, the kindness of God let me see that there's lots of ways that seem right to me,

434
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 but they're always going to end in the way of death.

435
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I love the story of a guy that was a Supreme Court Justice in England,

436
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 and he was a very righteous man, a very philanthropic man.

437
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 He was kind and gracious to many. He was just as a judge,

438
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 and he was a leader and a ruler in his church. He was an elder, if you will.

439
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 He was one time at the communion rail, and next to him, a guy that he had prosecuted

440
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 and that he had actually adjudicated over and had sent to prison took communion next to him.

441
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Now, this particular distinguished judge was good friends with the rector

442
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 of that particular Episcopal church or Anglican church,

443
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 and they were walking home after that particular Sunday,

444
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 and the rector said to this distinguished judge,

445
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 "Hey, did you see who took communion next to you today?"

446
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And the judge said, "Yes, I did."

447
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 And the rector said, "What an amazing picture of grace."

448
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And the judge said, "I absolutely agree, but let me ask you a question.

449
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Of whom do you speak?"

450
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And the rector said, "Well, I'm talking about the guy that was in jail, of course."

451
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And he goes, "No, you shouldn't be saying it was an amazing work of grace that that guy came to Christ.

452
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 The amazing work of grace is that I came to Christ.

453
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 I was born into a loving home. I was raised and educated.

454
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 I've been prosperous in my industry my entire day.

455
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 I'm a respected citizen of this community,

456
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 and that God would allow me to see my desperation and need before him,

457
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 that's a work of grace.

458
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 That man has been discouraged from his birth, abandoned by his father,

459
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 atheistic on society, in prison for his wrong,

460
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 suffered greatly for his rebellion.

461
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 That man has every reason to see his need for salvation.

462
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 The work of grace is in one as righteous and as acceptable in society's eyes as me,

463
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 that I know that I desperately need a Savior."

464
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Look, some of you guys are out there, and you think you don't have some spectacular testimony,

465
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 that there's not been some journey through the great abyss.

466
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 You haven't had three abortions, and you haven't come through 16 different bits of gender dysphoria

467
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 and clicked on every possible gender description on Facebook before you found Jesus.

468
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 So you don't have a real testimony.

469
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Let me tell you something, man. You've got a testimony.

470
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 If you've lived in this life and have largely lived a moral and good life,

471
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 maybe you've been raised in a godly home,

472
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 and you've come to see that the reason you're rightly related to God

473
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 is not because your parents took you to church,

474
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 or early on you were described about the goodness of God,

475
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 but that you in your life personally responded to that at some point.

476
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And you saw how great a need you had for a Savior.

477
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 There is no one under heaven who doesn't need to repent.

478
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 And when you look at others that maybe struggle in ways that are different than you,

479
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 and you look on them with arrogance,

480
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 you don't understand how great the salvation is that has saved you.

481
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Jonah's problem, you'll see, is that he thought that he was a prophet,

482
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 so God was lucky to have him.

483
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And what you're going to see is this prophet needed to be saved

484
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 as much as those that he was called to go preach to.

485
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Jonah was given the word of the Lord,

486
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 and if you've been given the word of the Lord, you are a prophet.

487
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 He is told to arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry against it,

488
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 for the wickedness has come up before me.

489
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Just know this, that there is no sin under heaven which God does not see.

490
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And sometimes we look at what's going on out there in the world,

491
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 and we see all this evil, and we wonder when God's going to act against it.

492
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Mark my word, it'll come soon enough.

493
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 You need to know that God's always cared about sin everywhere.

494
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And it says in the Bible, in Ezekiel 33, Ezekiel 18, and other places,

495
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 that God takes no delight in the death of the wicked.

496
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Let me say that again.

497
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 God takes no delight in the death of the wicked.

498
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And so neither should we.

499
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 But God has appointed a time when he will judge all the world,

500
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 but that time, sometimes he delays.

501
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 The Scripture says the reason he's delayed it, at least until June 14, 2016,

502
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 is not because he's slow, as some count slowness,

503
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 but God is patient towards you, wishing that none should perish,

504
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 but that all should come to repentance.

505
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 For God doesn't take delight in your wicked death.

506
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And so I don't know how long God's going to tarry.

507
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 I want to make this point right here.

508
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Listen, this is true, Ninevites,

509
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 that God always offers forgiveness to your repentance,

510
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 and you need to know that.

511
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 But you also need to know that God does not promise tomorrow to your procrastination.

512
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Today is the day, the Scripture says,

513
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 that you should respond to the grace of God that's made known to you.

514
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Because surely in a flood of great waters you may not be found.

515
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And so none of us know when time's going to be rolled up like a scroll,

516
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 or when our day's going to come quickly upon us,

517
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 but it's going to come, and God knew when it was going to come for the Ninevites.

518
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 It was 612 BC.

519
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Jonah appears somewhere in the 8th century BC,

520
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 about 150 years before Nineveh was judged, he sent them Jonah.

521
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Now what you're going to find out in this story is that Ninevites responded to Jonah's preaching.

522
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 But what also happened is a couple of generations later,

523
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 they reverted back to the worship of their pagan gods.

524
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And so God sent them another prophet.

525
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Did you know that God sent two prophets, not just one to Nineveh?

526
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 The second one is called Nahum.

527
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 The word means comfort.

528
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Jonah means peace.

529
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 God sent a dove, it means dove actually,

530
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 and dove is one that came in peace,

531
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 and he came to them and said, "Listen, I don't want to be at enmity between you and you wicked Assyrians,

532
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 but you've got to know this, that I'm a god that isn't just a god willing to make peace with you.

533
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 I'm a god that if you don't make peace with me, you're going to have to do business with me.

534
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 And you might think of me letting you run in your riotous reign over me

535
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 while you're in your 20s or in your excessive celebration of youth,

536
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 that judgment will never come, but mark my word, judgment is coming."

537
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And so God kept sending people who had heard the word of the Lord to them.

538
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 And their wickedness was not in any way missed by God.

539
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 This is what it says in Jeremiah chapter 23, verse 24.

540
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 It says, "Can a man hide himself in hiding places so that I do not see him?" declares the Lord.

541
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?

542
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Psalm 139 says this, "Where can I go from your spirit?

543
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Or where can I flee from your presence?

544
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 If I ascend to heaven, you are there.

545
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there.

546
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 If I take the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea,

547
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 even there your hand will lead me and your right hand will lay hold of me.

548
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 If I say, 'Surely the darkness will overwhelm me and the light around me will be night,'

549
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 even the darkness is not dark to you and the night is as bright as the day.

550
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Darkness and light are alike to you.

551
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 There is no way I can go from the presence of God."

552
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 You're going to find out that that's not just true of Assyrians who haven't repented yet.

553
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 That's true of believers who are not responding yet.

554
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 So God was well aware of the Assyrians' wickedness.

555
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 And he was about to send a prophet to them.

556
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 It says, "But Jonah," in verse 3, "rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord."

557
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 So he went down to Joppa. Joppa is a port city.

558
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And it says he found a ship which was going to Tarshish, which is in Gibraltar,

559
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 which is in the southern part of Spain, which is about 2,500 miles the wrong direction from Nineveh.

560
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Here's a map of it.

561
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 So Joppa, it's a modern-day town.

562
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Today you can go to Joppa. I've been there at the port of Joppa.

563
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 And you look across the Mediterranean Sea, and you've got to sail across the Aegean Sea

564
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 and make your way all the way underneath Italy,

565
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 and further make your way all the way over to where the Rock of Gibraltar is there in southern Spain.

566
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 It was the farthest known part of the sea that anybody sailed to.

567
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And so Jonah said, "Let me get the fat out of anything that God has me doing."

568
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Because what God has me doing didn't make any sense to Jonah.

569
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Watch what happens when Jonah, the prophet, decides to not walk in the light that he has been given.

570
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 It says, "The Lord hurled a great wind on the sea, and there was a great storm on the sea,

571
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 so the ship was about to break up.

572
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 The sailors became afraid, and every man cried to his God,

573
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 and they threw the cargo which was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them.

574
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship, laying down and falling asleep."

575
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 One of the things you're going to see if you study this is just the way the writer talks about

576
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 how Jonah keeps going down. He went down to Joppa.

577
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 He wanted to go down to Tarsus.

578
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 There's trouble, so he goes down to the bottom of the bowels of the ship.

579
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 He tried to go asleep. He tried to numb himself from the horrors that were around him

580
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 as he knew he was trying to run away from the will of God, but you can't do that.

581
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 The captain approached him and said, "How is it you're sleeping? Get up. Call on your God."

582
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 In other words, we don't know who you believe in, but we're all calling on every God that we know.

583
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Perhaps your God will be concerned about us so that we will not perish because our gods aren't listening.

584
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 "Each man said to his mate, 'Come, let us cast lots, so we may learn on whose account this calamity has struck us.'"

585
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.

586
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 And they said, "Tell us now, on whose account has this calamity struck?

587
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your country?

588
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 From what people are you?"

589
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And he said to them, "I'm a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."

590
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Well, if only that was true.

591
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 "The men became extremely frightened. They said to him, 'How could you do this?'"

592
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Because Jonah apparently had gone on to explain to them that, "I know what's going on.

593
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 God's told me to go right, and I'm going left."

594
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 It says, "The men became extremely frightened. They said, 'How could you do this?'

595
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 For they knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them so."

596
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Can I just make a real simple observation here? Because, man, you guys need to know this.

597
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Whenever you run into somebody that is fleeing from the presence of the Lord, it's going to be trouble.

598
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 This is why, and I want to say this as kindly as I can to you, this is why, you know, God says,

599
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 "Look, man, if you want to marry, you have not sinned. It's fine. Go ahead and get married.

600
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 But I'm going to beg of you, if you get married, don't yoke yourself.

601
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 Don't enter into business with somebody whose business is fleeing from the presence of the Lord.

602
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Don't date somebody."

603
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 This is the big thing about sex and relationships.

604
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 The problem with sex and relationships is that when you're having premarital sex,

605
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 it's not just the problems that premarital sex can create in your relationship.

606
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 And it can create some, because you're using a gift that God gave you in a way that he didn't decide or declare it should be given to you.

607
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 God doesn't have any problem with sex. He designed sex. God's a huge fan of sex.

608
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 But he's just saying, "Look, man, this gift I've given you, use that gift the way that it's intended to be used."

609
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 The most classic illustration of a gift.

610
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 I mean, there's no greater gift that God has given man than fire.

611
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 It brings light. It brings heat. It brings warmth.

612
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 I love fire. I have three fireplaces in my house in Dallas where the average temperature is almost 60 degrees.

613
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Every chance I get, I build a fire in my home.

614
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 But here's the deal, man.

615
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 This thing, whenever you build a fire, our family gathers around it.

616
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 It brings light. It brings warmth. I love the smell. It attracts people.

617
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 But if we took fire out of the place it is designed to be in our home, and we just moved it to the couch,

618
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 because we love fire, so we're going to take it everywhere, and we just put it in a cabinet?

619
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Or go, "Hey, let's just put fire over here on the wall."

620
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 It's a great thing, but when you take that gift and you put it in the wrong spot,

621
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 it no longer is something that brings joy and warmth to the home.

622
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 It destroys the home.

623
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Sex is just like that.

624
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 And here's the thing. There's consequences when we take a gift and we misuse it.

625
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 God's not angry at you. You're not being punished for the way you misused the gift.

626
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 That's why you get an STD, or that's why you get an unwanted pregnancy.

627
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 I mean, that's just what happens.

628
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 It's like sin is its own judgment. It's not God smiting you.

629
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 It's just what happens when you use gifts wrong.

630
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 It's like if I gave you a chainsaw, and you go, "Hey, look, a chainsaw Todd gave me to cut firewood

631
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 and to take down trees that are going to fall on my roof," and you go, "You know what?

632
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 Let's use it as dental floss. It'll do a fine job."

633
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Okay, that chainsaw is dental floss for you, but it's not going to also probably do well for the rest of your face.

634
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 It'll get that little annoying piece of popcorn out between your teeth.

635
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Isn't it crazy that when you finally get that piece of popcorn out between your teeth,

636
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 what's the first thing you do? You chew it, right?

637
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Don't we? We're like, "God dang it!"

638
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 "Mm, got it."

639
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 Isn't that like us in sin?

640
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 "This is really bothering me. This is really bothering me. Okay, good. The pain's gone.

641
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Let me go back to that sin."

642
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 It's crazy. Spit it out.

643
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 So look, when you use a gift and you misuse the gift,

644
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 it's not like I'm judging you because you misused the gift.

645
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 The misusing of the gift is the judgment.

646
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 I'm not mad at you. I don't have to be mad at you.

647
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 Just misusing the chainsaw is its own judgment.

648
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 There might be a moment where it pops out and it feels good, but boy, it's not going to last long.

649
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 And all I want to tell you is this. This is why God tells you,

650
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 "Hey, listen, I'm begging you to not sail with people who are running from the presence of the Lord."

651
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 You yoke yourself to that.

652
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 There might be a time because people and relationships are a gift for me

653
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 that that relationship initially will be a glory to you.

654
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 That chainsaw will work to get that little annoyance,

655
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 but it's going to keep moving through and it's going to hit the nerve

656
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 and it's going to cause all kinds of pain and create scars and death.

657
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 And so God just says, "Look, man, you're free to marry, but I'm just begging you, don't marry.

658
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Don't yoke with somebody who flees from the presence of the Lord."

659
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 This is the biggest problem with premarital sex. Are you ready?

660
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 It's an indication that no matter what somebody tells you

661
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 about how serious they are about wanting what God wants,

662
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 what they really want is what they want, and they don't really care what God wants.

663
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 They're going to rationalize and justify whatever they want to

664
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 because it gives them pleasure.

665
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 And when you yoke yourself to somebody that drags you into a relationship,

666
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 and no matter what they say about God, I don't care if you met them at the porch,

667
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 I don't care if they're a community group leader,

668
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 if they drag you into using a provision of God

669
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 and sail in their relational practices with you away from the presence of the Lord,

670
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 and you yoke yourself to them, what you are doing is you're saying right now,

671
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 "I want to sail with somebody who's already declared."

672
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 It doesn't matter what God says. They're going to rationalize and justify their own program.

673
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 And I'm just going to tell you, that's going to be your problem,

674
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 not the fact that you had premarital sex,

675
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 but that you're yoking yourself to somebody who sails through this life

676
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 in a way that has no respect

677
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 for the navigational charts that God who loves you has given you.

678
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 It is a tell. It's an indication that they are their own sovereign.

679
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And that makes for really rocky seas.

680
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 So what you're going to find out is that God's not mad at you

681
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 when trouble comes in your life.

682
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 He's mad at you when you experience a little bit of the problems

683
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 that come when you move away from him.

684
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 And that's what a loving God does.

685
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 I'll show you that in just a moment with Jonah.

686
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 They said to him, "What would we do that the sea may become calm for us?

687
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 For the sea was becoming increasingly stormy."

688
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 He said to them, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea."

689
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 Jonah's telling you, "This is what you have to do.

690
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Then the sea will become calm for you.

691
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 For I know that on account of me, this great storm has come upon you."

692
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 This is where Jonah, who is a type of Christ, he's a picture

693
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 of who Christ is going to be, is a picture but not the complete picture.

694
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Watch this. Here's what he says.

695
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 "What you've got to do is pick me up and throw me into the sea.

696
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 The only way that this judgment is going to leave you

697
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 is if I become a sacrifice for you."

698
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 This next line, "I know on account of me, this great storm has come upon you"

699
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 is not what's true of Christ.

700
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 Christ says, "It's on account of you that this great storm is going to come upon me.

701
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 All of you, like sheep, have gone astray.

702
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 The Lord will cause the iniquity of you to fall on me."

703
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Jesus says, "I'm going to go a place you cannot go

704
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 to stand before the judgment of God.

705
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 I'm going to give my life, but because I'm without sin,

706
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 once I give my life for sin and the debt's been paid,

707
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 God can in his just pour out his wrath and in his justice

708
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 declare that the debt has been paid so that I, myself,

709
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 can be the first fruits of those raised from the dead

710
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 and all who believe in me and follow the words of this great prophet can be saved."

711
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 But watch what men do.

712
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Sometimes the way of God doesn't make sense.

713
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 It never makes sense to pagans who don't believe in prophets.

714
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 The pagans here go, "That doesn't sound like what God would want me to do."

715
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 And so what do they do?

716
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 It says, "The men rode desperately to return to land."

717
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 See, this is what men do.

718
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 Men don't believe that the prophet has to be given for them.

719
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 Men believe that their own efforts can get them back to a place of safety.

720
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 And so they worked with all their might to make their way back to peace and safety.

721
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Just like most men and women today, when you ask them,

722
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 "Hey, are you at a place in your life where you think the seas of wrath

723
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 between you and God can be brought to a place where they're calm?"

724
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 You go, "Yeah, well, how? Well, I think I just got to behave as I sail through life.

725
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 And if I behave more than I disbehave, the seas will eventually be calm

726
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 and I'll make my way into the presence of God."

727
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 And God says, "No, man, you got to do something.

728
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 And that is to believe that the prophet has been thrown into the sea of judgment for you.

729
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 And that's the only way that you can be reconciled to me."

730
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 Men always try and row their way to God.

731
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 They always try and work their way.

732
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 But watch what happens when men try and earn their salvation.

733
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 It says the storm is becoming even worse against them.

734
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 They could not make it for the sea was becoming even stormier.

735
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And then they called on the Lord finally and said, "We earnestly pray, O Lord,

736
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 don't let us perish on account of this man's life.

737
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 Do not put innocent blood on us, for you, O Lord, have done as you have pleased."

738
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 So they picked up Jonah. Finally, they listened to the word of the Lord.

739
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 Because why? Because the pain got so great that they finally realized

740
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 that the efforts of their own way to navigate through the sea of life were futile.

741
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 You're going to see this theme show up in pagans and in disobedient prophets.

742
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 And there's a little truth that I want you both to understand.

743
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 And I'm going to say it to you in a couple of different ways.

744
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 And then number one, I'm just going to tell you,

745
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 when you are doing things that God doesn't want you to do,

746
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 and consequence comes to you,

747
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 it's not because God's trying to pay you back for the wrong that you have done.

748
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 It's God is trying to bring you back to what you should do.

749
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 Let me say that again.

750
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 Is when you experiencing wrong is the wages of the wrong that you have done.

751
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 It's not God's punishment.

752
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 It's God's allowing you to experience the consequences of your choices

753
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 so that you can learn to hate those choices.

754
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 Not because God's trying to pay you back for your choices,

755
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 but because he's trying to bring you back to him.

756
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 And what you're going to see is that the pagans who didn't know who Jonah was

757
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 and what the prophet said, tried to work until that work failed them.

758
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 And there's a way that seemed right to them, but it was leading to death.

759
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 And so they finally stopped the way that seemed right to me.

760
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 And they repented and listened to the prophet.

761
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 You're going to find that the prophet tried to go where he wanted to go

762
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 and do what he wanted to do until it got him further and further and further in trouble.

763
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 And finally, he says, I think I'll start to do what God wants me to do.

764
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 Can I just tell you something? God's not angry at you.

765
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 God is not trying to catch you in your sin.

766
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 He is looking to free you from the sin,

767
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 which has captured you.

768
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 And one of the grandest things that God can do for you is to let you reap what you sow.

769
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 And so the God of life and light and joy,

770
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 when you leave him, lets you experience darkness and despair and death.

771
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 Not as a judgment, because sin is its own judgment.

772
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 Are you here? And are you at a place in your life where you're like,

773
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 you know what, this way which seems right to me is not bringing me what I want.

774
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 I mean, I might have momentary fits of pleasure.

775
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 I might have that little kernel pop out of my mouth for a second,

776
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 but there's a long scar there afterwards.

777
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 There's a bitter aftertaste of me using the gifts God's given me in a way that he doesn't intend.

778
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.

779
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 And God goes, okay, well, come here, man. Let me heal you.

780
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Let me put you on a different course. I'm not mad at you.

781
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 But I'm also not going to protect you from the consequences.

782
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 Because that's what a loving father does.

783
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 He doesn't enable you.

784
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 And he doesn't move towards you in anger.

785
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 Now, God hates sin. Why does God hate sin?

786
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 He hates sin because he loves you.

787
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 And so what'd God do as a result of your sin?

788
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 He did something about it. He let himself be cast into the sea of judgment.

789
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 And just like Jonah, Jesus would say to you,

790
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 hey, look, man, here's the only way you're going to be saved.

791
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 Not by your rowing and trying to be righteous before God,

792
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 but you got to let me be thrown in, man.

793
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 You got to let me be thrown before the judgment of God.

794
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 That's the only way that this sea is going to get calm.

795
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 And you go, that doesn't seem right to me,

796
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 that this guy would die, that I might live.

797
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 But it's really not about you,

798
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 because you're not an infinite, holy, perfect God.

799
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 So you don't know what kind of infinite, holy, perfect sacrifice he demands.

800
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 And so you can row all you want to try and make yourself righteous.

801
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 I'm just going to tell you, the sea's only going to get more violent.

802
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 You're never going to rest.

803
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 You're never going to know if you're righteous enough.

804
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 And if you would just listen, the answer would be,

805
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 you'll never be righteous enough to meet the standard of God.

806
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 If a man, it says, commits one sin, he is guilty of the law.

807
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 He is a lawbreaker.

808
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 The standard of Scripture is, be perfect as I'm perfect.

809
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 If you're righteous, it doesn't surpass that of the Pharisees.

810
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 You won't enter into the kingdom of heaven.

811
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 That's all of us. All of us have sinned and gone astray.

812
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 And all of us need a savior.

813
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 And you better find out who your prophet is to throw into the sea of judgment.

814
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Jesus says, "I'm the God."

815
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 And they called on the name of the Lord in verse 14.

816
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 They said, "We earnestly pray, O Lord, don't let us perish on account of this man's life.

817
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 And don't let us put innocent blood in us, for you, O Lord, have done as you've pleased."

818
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 So they picked up Jonah, they threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped. It's raging.

819
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 The men feared the Lord greatly.

820
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 They offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and they made vows.

821
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 It's always better to make vows after salvation,

822
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 and not say, "Lord, I'll do this so you'll save me."

823
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 Righteous men don't say, "God, I'll do this so you'll save me."

824
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 Righteous men see what God has done to save them, and they respond to it.

825
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 In other words, we as believers, we don't do what we do so God will love us.

826
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 I don't say, "God, I'm going to serve you. I'm going to be faithful to share with the Syrians.

827
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 I'm going to live my life. I'm going to stop premarital nonsense.

828
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 When I'm married, I'm going to be faithful. I'm going to not look at that crap again.

829
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 I'm not going to give myself over to numbing myself with drugs or other pleasures.

830
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 And then, God, I'll be holy." No.

831
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 Men see that God makes them holy, and they respond.

832
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 We are not people who have performance-based acceptance.

833
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 We are people who understand what God has done for us.

834
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 We see it. We see the peace that we have with God

835
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 through the sacrifice of His holy prophet, and we go, "I want to respond to that."

836
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 Do you see that?

837
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 There's nothing in me that will make me ever go, "God, you owe me salvation.

838
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 It was a gift from the beginning. I don't know why

839
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 He allowed His prophet to go into the sea of judgment for me,

840
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 but having seen it, I just go, 'Man, why wouldn't I want to serve that God?'"

841
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 Shane did a great job earlier tonight here in Dallas.

842
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 If you were here singing and talking about the one who did not spare His own Son

843
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 but delivered Him up for us all, won't He then do every good thing for us,

844
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 it says in Romans 8?

845
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 "Why wouldn't I serve that God?"

846
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 And so these men saw when God had made provision for them

847
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 through the sacrifice of another, they go, "Let's serve the God of that prophet."

848
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 It is acceptance-based performance.

849
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 It is love which constrains us.

850
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 It's always good to make vows when you see love, not to make vows to earn love.

851
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 "The Lord appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah,

852
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish three days and three nights."

853
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 He kind of keeps getting worse for Jonah.

854
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 He keeps going down, down, down, down, but finally, in his pain,

855
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 and maybe some of you guys are here tonight,

856
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 but he keeps going down low enough that you're sick and tired of being sick and tired.

857
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 It says, "Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the stomach of the fish."

858
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 God loves you enough to bring you to distress with your disobedience.

859
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 God isn't looking to catch you in your sin.

860
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 He is looking to free you from the sin that has captured you.

861
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 God's not looking to pay you back.

862
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 God's looking to bring you back, and as soon as you cry out

863
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 in your distress to the Lord, he will answer.

864
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 It says, "I cried for help from the depths of Sheol, and you heard my voice."

865
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 Jonah went on from there, the story says, to do what he should do,

866
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 because he understood, and if you read a little bit further,

867
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 in chapter 3, verse 1, it says, "Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time."

868
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 And this time, Jonah got busy doing what he should do,

869
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 and I just want to make a couple of quick observations now when we're done.

870
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 There's really four people in life.

871
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 There's folks that are lost, and they acknowledge that they're lost,

872
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 and they know that there's no way they can row themselves to safety,

873
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 and to you, God says, "That's great. Take this provision that I've given for you."

874
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 Some of you guys are here. You've never come to a place yet

875
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 where you know you're forgiven, but you know you're lost,

876
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 and I'm here to tell you that God has thrown the prophet into the sea of judgment for you.

877
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 And God has made the way of mercy.

878
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 Wherever you are that you're listening, if you're sick and tired of being sick and tired,

879
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 and you know that you're separated from God,

880
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 then I'm here to tell you that God wants you to be reconciled to Him.

881
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 He wants to offer you this gift.

882
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door,

883
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with me."

884
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 And God's just here tonight to tell you, "Man, just let me in."

885
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 If you're lost and you know it, then let the way and the truth and the life come into you and receive it.

886
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 And then there are those that are lost and they don't know it.

887
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 And to you, I want to tell you that while you're still rowing,

888
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 maybe while your seas aren't rough enough, all I would say to you is,

889
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 "Look, we're not going to love you more if you agree with us,

890
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 and I'm just going to tell you that if you like what you got,

891
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 I encourage you to keep doing what you're doing, but I'm going to remind you,

892
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 if you keep doing what you're doing, you're not going to like what you got."

893
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 Because it's just a matter of time before you get low enough

894
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 that the pain's going to be intense enough that you're going to wonder

895
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 how in the world you got here.

896
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 You know, one of the things I do when everyone with my kids and we're out

897
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 and we come up across somebody that's living on the streets and we're asked to help them,

898
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 I always, "Man, tell me your name."

899
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 "My name's Todd. I introduced myself."

900
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
 "Just go tell me your story."

901
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 "You want to hear my story?"

902
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
 I go, "Yeah, man."

903
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 I have my kids right there with me.

904
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 I say, "Just tell us your story. How'd you end up here?"

905
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 And they always say the same thing.

906
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 They always go, "I'll tell you how I got here, man.

907
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
 One bad decision at a time, and then another bad decision after that."

908
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 And I always ask them if they want to turn around those decisions,

909
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 or if they just want me to give them something that would give them strength

910
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 given their rebellion and their self-will and their despair and their wondering further.

911
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 And I go, "I'm not going to enable you in that, man."

912
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 The Bible's really clear in 2 Thessalonians 3.

913
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 It says, "If a man doesn't work, let his stomach work for him.

914
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 Let the pain of his circumstance go."

915
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 Hey, being lazy, being a slugger, being irresponsible, being addicted,

916
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 not taking opportunity to deal with my addiction and to find training

917
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 and to maybe be reparented and to start to work my way out.

918
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
 Man, let your stomach work for him.

919
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 Sometimes God is not trying to pay you back, but he's trying to draw you back.

920
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 And what you don't want to do is keep enabling people.

921
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 You also don't want to look at those people and think, "Man, what a scourge of the earth.

922
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 I look at them, and I just go, 'Hey, I really understand.

923
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
 I was with one of those guys today.'

924
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 And I just told them, 'Man, you're going to have to trust me.

925
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 I don't think I'm better than you.'

926
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 But by the grace of God, I've encountered truth maybe earlier in my life

927
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 than you're encountering it, and I've started to make decisions to walk with this God.

928
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 And that God wants to start to walk with you.

929
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 And if you'll let me, I'll begin to walk with you.

930
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 We'll get shelter. We'll get training. We'll get food. We'll get provision.

931
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
 And I'll let you know the God that keeps me from bringing despair to my heart on the streets."

932
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 This particular friend wasn't ready yet.

933
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 So we had a great conversation, and I said, "Bro, if you like what you got,

934
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 keep doing what you're doing.

935
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:36,000
 But if you keep doing what you're doing, you're not going to like what you got."

936
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 Thirdly, there's people who are saved, and they don't act like it.

937
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 There's folks that are lost, and they know it.

938
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 To you, I say, "Come."

939
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
 There's folks that are lost, and they don't think they're lost,

940
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
 and they like the way they're sailing, but say, "You keep sailing."

941
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
 And when the seas get rough enough, I hope you remember tonight's message.

942
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
 There's somebody who's been thrown in the sea for you to make it calm.

943
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
 But then there's some people that have been saved, and they don't sail like it.

944
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 And to you, I wanted to tell you, man, when you are given the Word of God,

945
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 and you don't deal to it kindly, you better check to see if you even know about the love of God.

946
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
 Because people that really know the love of God, when they see it, they make a vow.

947
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 And they go, "I'm going to respond to that love.

948
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:23,000
 I'm not going to try and earn it, but I see that love, and that love compels me."

949
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
 And I want to just remind you of that earlier story.

950
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
 What about those people who have never heard?

951
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
 Well, I'm not so concerned about that person who's never heard.

952
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
 A better question is, what about those who have heard

953
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 and don't care to share that, what we have heard, with others?

954
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 Can we really have heard?

955
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 And then there's the fourth group.

956
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,000
 It's those who have really heard the Word of the Lord, and they're serving.

957
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 And they're out there, and they're faithful.

958
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
 And they don't look at others like they're Ninevites,

959
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
 and man, may the grace of God not come to them.

960
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 No, they really love them.

961
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
 I want to tell you a story of a guy I was just with.

962
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 I just got back from Turkey and Eurasia and that general region,

963
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 and I was talking to a friend of mine that is a former imam in Jordan.

964
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
 He was a particular guy that was rowing and rowing and rowing and rowing as an imam.

965
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
 He said, "I was ready to die for Allah.

966
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 I was planning to give my life on a suicide mission for Allah

967
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
 because I knew that was the only way that I could earn Allah's love

968
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 in this system invented by men."

969
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 And the systems of men are always, "Row your way to peace with Allah."

970
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 And he said, "And I saw the futility of this,

971
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
 and eventually before I killed myself, I died to the idea."

972
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
 And he said, "I became an atheist, and as soon as I left Islam,

973
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 becoming an imam, I didn't trust anything else,

974
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 but because I no longer served Allah, men started to want to kill me."

975
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,000
 I had another friend who had come to understand that a prophet had been given for them.

976
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
 That there was a God that didn't want you to earn His love,

977
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
 but there was a God that loved you.

978
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 Do you know in Islam, there's 99 names for Allah.

979
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 They're called the 99 beautiful names for the Lord.

980
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 That's what Allah means in Arabic.

981
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 And not a single one of those 99 names that represent Allah

982
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 have the idea of love in them.

983
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 And this friend told him about a God who said, "He is love."

984
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 And he demonstrated his love in that while we're still rowing,

985
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 most of us in a disobedient direction,

986
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 He died for us, and He made provision for us.

987
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 Because He's just, and in no means will He let the guilty go unpunished,

988
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 but He Himself has given His life for them,

989
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
 that He might be just and the justifier of those that He loves.

990
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
 And he heard the story, and he wept.

991
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
 And he left his atheism and he became a believer.

992
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 And then he came across one of his former Islamic friends,

993
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
 who walked up behind him with a screwdriver and drove it through his back.

994
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
 He felt the pain and he turned around, the man removed the screwdriver,

995
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
 and shoved it in the front of his chest.

996
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
 And pulled it out to stab him a third time,

997
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 and he grabbed his hands and he took his by the head,

998
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 and they were smashing, he was smashing his head

999
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
 and the guy's weakness into the wall,

1000
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
 and he just held on him screaming till somebody came and broke them up.

1001
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 Now in Jordan what they do when they see two men fighting,

1002
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 is they arrest them both.

1003
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 And so these two men were arrested.

1004
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
 They stopped his hemorrhaging and bleeding, it missed all vital organs.

1005
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 He had a penetration through the back to the front,

1006
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
 and from the front toward the back,

1007
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 and they put them in the same jail cell that evening.

1008
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 And while he was in that same jail cell,

1009
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
 he looked at that man, they were both cuffed so they couldn't hurt each other,

1010
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 and he said, "I want you to know I don't hate you.

1011
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 "And I want you to know that if I live through this,

1012
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 "that my family's not going to try and strike revenge against you."

1013
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
 The next day they were separated,

1014
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
 they were asked to tell their story four different times.

1015
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
 The man who was stabbed told the same story four times.

1016
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 The man who did the stabbing told four different stories,

1017
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
 so they knew who was lying.

1018
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 And they were going to put this gentleman who had run the screwdriver

1019
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
 through him front and back in prison,

1020
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 and he stood up, my friend, the former Irman,

1021
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
 who was now a follower of the prophet,

1022
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 who was thrown into the sea for others,

1023
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
 and he said, "Judge, if you will, I want to speak to the man who did this to me.

1024
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
 "I want to say again to the court, I forgive you, and I forgive him.

1025
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
 "And I love you, and I know you're doing what you think you should do

1026
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
 "in order to please the God that you know,

1027
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
 "but the God that you know is no God at all.

1028
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 "The God you need to know is the God who gave his life for you,

1029
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 "and he gave his life for me,

1030
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 "and if he was willing to save one such as me,

1031
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
 "he's willing for me to forgive one such as you."

1032
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 And that man looked at him and said,

1033
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
 "Now I know that your God is the one true God

1034
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
 "because I've never seen love like that."

1035
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:52,000
 That's what people who have come to know the kindness of God do.

1036
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
 If you have received the word of the Lord, having received it,

1037
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
 there is an obligation to share it.

1038
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
 I love this little poem. It always encourages me.

1039
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 It goes like this. It's called "My Friend."

1040
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
 It says, "My friend, I stand in judgment now

1041
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
 "and feel that you're to blame somehow.

1042
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
 "On earth I walked with you day by day.

1043
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
 "Never did you point me the way.

1044
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
 "You knew the Lord in truth and glory,

1045
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
 "but never did you tell me the story.

1046
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
 "My knowledge then was very dim.

1047
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
 "You could have led me straight to him.

1048
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 "Though we lived together on earth,

1049
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
 "you never told me of the second birth,

1050
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
 "and now I stand to stay condemned

1051
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
 "because you failed to mention him.

1052
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
 "You taught me many things, that's true.

1053
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
 "I called you friend and trusted you,

1054
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
 "but I learn now that it's too late.

1055
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
 "You could have saved me from this fate.

1056
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
 "We walked by day, we talked by night,

1057
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
 "and yet you showed me not the light.

1058
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
 "You let me live and love and die.

1059
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
 "You knew I'd never live on high.

1060
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
 "Yes, I called you friend in life

1061
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
 "and laughed with you through joy and stripe,

1062
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
 "and yet on coming to the end,

1063
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,000
 "I cannot call you now my friend,

1064
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
 "because you didn't want to go through the awkwardness

1065
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 "of telling me that you believe that God threw a prophet

1066
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
 "in the sea of judgment for you

1067
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:04,000
 "because you thought it would make me think you were crazy."

1068
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
 See, man, this is what prophets do.

1069
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
 People who are really saved and act like they're saved

1070
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
 are a blessing to others.

1071
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
 They realize that they were blessed to be a blessing.

1072
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
 Can I just close this by telling you

1073
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
 that there's another one who was a prophet

1074
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
 who was from Kephir Nahum.

1075
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
 Capernaum is the town.

1076
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
 It means the village of comfort.

1077
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
 Just like there was a prophet, Nahum,

1078
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
 that was sent to the Assyrians who worshiped the fish god

1079
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
 that God had once swallowed up by a great fish

1080
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
 that was spit out probably with some sort of lactic acid

1081
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 all over him so he was bleached white,

1082
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
 and so here comes this guy spit up on the fish,

1083
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 looked like a ghost, preaching reconciliation with God.

1084
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
 They might have listened to that message.

1085
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
 In other words, his life was radically changed

1086
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
 and he carried a message of power.

1087
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 So should yours.

1088
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
 If you're really saved, you start to become that one.

1089
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
 When Jesus was here, he was exactly that.

1090
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
 He said if you don't believe my words, believe my walk.

1091
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
 They said well show us some more signs.

1092
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
 He said there's no more signs except the sign of Jonah.

1093
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
 When I'm swallowed up, if you will, for three days

1094
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
 in what looks like certain death, only to live again

1095
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
 from which I will pronounce to you one more time,

1096
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,000
 I am the way, the truth, and the life.

1097
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 See I don't know what you worship, but I'm gonna tell you

1098
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
 that when you see a God defeat your great enemy death

1099
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
 and he returns and tells you I did this for you,

1100
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
 that's not just some story in history,

1101
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 it is the pivot point of your eternity.

1102
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
 And what you do with that prophet who was thrown

1103
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
 in the sea of judgment for you will determine

1104
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
 where you spend it.

1105
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
 And if you know him, you will make a vow to love him

1106
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
 the way he gave his life for you.

1107
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
 And part of that is having received that word

1108
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
 is to gladly share it with others.

1109
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
 And so this story that happened before Christ

1110
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
 anticipates Christ and the story about Christ

1111
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 anticipates that you should respond to it

1112
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
 and you should join Christ in suffering in every way

1113
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 that you need to so that the world might know

1114
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
 you died to yourself, that Christ might live in you

1115
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
 and his message might go forth and his power might be seen

1116
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
 so the Ninevites could be free.

1117
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
 Father I pray if there's any Ninevites in the room,

1118
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
 folks who came in here that are living lives of terror,

1119
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
 that maybe are in rooms in Houston and Fort Worth

1120
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
 and in Dallas and other places watching around the world

1121
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
 tonight that all they seek to do is to live in rebellion

1122
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
 against God and to bring others into their powers

1123
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
 and into their patterns so that they can have sway

1124
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
 over them and use them for their own pleasure.

1125
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
 And Lord we don't look at any of the people that are here

1126
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
 and listen to this message like we're better than them.

1127
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 That's the way we would have sailed unless grace came to us,

1128
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 unless the great prophet convinced us that there was

1129
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
 a better way and showed us love, that he gave his life for us,

1130
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
 that we might be reconciled to you in goodness

1131
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
 so that we could start to sail towards safe harbors

1132
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
 filled with hope and with song.

1133
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
 So Lord we thank you just for this story in history,

1134
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 the way you seek after rebels.

1135
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
 We thank you that that story anticipates the great prophet

1136
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
 who gave his perfect life for the Ninevites like me.

1137
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 That I would stop rowing towards you to try and earn my way

1138
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
 and I would receive the gift of your sacrifice

1139
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
 that I might live.

1140
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
 So Lord help me now having seen your great love,

1141
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 me to make a vow to try and respond to it.

1142
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
 Thank you that even my imperfection in responding to that,

1143
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
 your grace is sufficient.

1144
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 But Lord I want to learn more of your ways.

1145
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 I pray that my life would be as shockingly different

1146
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
 as Jonas must have been when he was regurgitated

1147
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 from the belly of a whale for three days.

1148
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
 That people would see that I've come from someplace else,

1149
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 sent forth from you, living in righteousness,

1150
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 sanctified by your work of deliverance.

1151
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
 With a mouth filled with kindness and grace,

1152
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
 speaking of the glories and goodness of who you are,

1153
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
 not who I am.

1154
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
 Realizing that the only reason I'm a prophet is because

1155
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
 I've received from you what I freely offer to others.

1156
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
 I pray Lord for people who really know you in this room,

1157
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
 that we would not sail on our own,

1158
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
 but we would go where you tell us to go

1159
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 and live as you tell us to live.

1160
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
 In humility, faithfulness, and love.

1161
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 Thank you that this room is filled with such men and women.

1162
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
 Thank you tonight that more can come.

1163
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:38,000
 If they just say I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.

1164
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
 I thank you that you gave your life for me.

1165
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
 I thank you that the sacrifice of your son

1166
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 calmed the seas of judgment due me.

1167
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
 I thank you Father that you raised him from that sea of judgment

1168
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
 as evidence that your wrath had been satisfied

1169
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
 and my debt has been paid.

1170
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
 And I pray that that power that resurrected him from the grave

1171
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
 as a sign of your grace would live in me

1172
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
 as I walk with you for the good of others

1173
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,000
 as I sing songs of redemption to Assyrians and prophets alike.

1174
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
 Lord would you help us to walk with you.

1175
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 Would you let us live in that grace in Jesus name.

1176
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
 Amen.

1177
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
 Well man if that song is the cry of your heart

1178
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
 then you're in a really good place.

1179
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
 (laughter)

1180
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 (applause)

1181
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
 Thank you.

1182
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
 Yeah let me just tell you and remind you about that picture.

1183
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
 I didn't see that thing.

1184
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 Put it back up there.

1185
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
 I didn't see that thing.

1186
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
 And what's amazing is some of you guys think you're in a good place maybe

1187
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
 and you don't want the Lord to take over yet.

1188
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
 You think you just swim in the ocean.

1189
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
 There's no monster here that can swallow me up.

1190
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
 This is all good.

1191
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
 And you don't even know what's right there next to you.

1192
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
 And God in his kindness one day

1193
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
 if you're blessed because the Lord disciplines his children

1194
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
 and those he loves you're going to find yourself in the belly of a whale.

1195
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
 And if you're not ready to respond tonight I pray you respond then.

1196
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
 I pray you know that God's not mad at you.

1197
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
 That he's not putting you in the belly of a whale because he's punishing you.

1198
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
 That's just what happens when you swim in a sea

1199
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
 where there are monsters that lurk.

1200
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
 And anytime you're not sailing with him you need to know

1201
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
 there are monsters in that ocean that can swallow you easily.

1202
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
 And God's always ready to hear your prayer.

1203
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
 But today is the day of salvation.

1204
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
 Let us cry to God

1205
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
 because in a flood of great waters he may not always be found.

1206
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
 But if you cry to him tonight

1207
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
 and you say take over lover of my soul

1208
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
 that you would throw yourself in the ocean

1209
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
 that I might be free.

1210
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
 He says just come.

1211
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
 And if you have come and you know him

1212
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
 then would you just go faithfully?

1213
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
 Would you go and tell others unashamedly and boldly?

1214
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
 Would you live and would you suffer for them?

1215
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
 Would you go into their Nineveh and declare?

1216
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
 Don't go and mingle with the Ninevites.

1217
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
 You've got to be distinct and different.

1218
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
 As one raised from the dead

1219
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
 clothed in righteousness

1220
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
 declaring to them the reason

1221
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
 for your otherworldly appearance.

1222
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
 With freedom.

1223
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
 Not performing so God would accept you

1224
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
 but out of his acceptance

1225
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
 responding in love.

1226
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
 Would you come if you don't know him?

1227
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
 Let him take over.

1228
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
 And would you go if he's taken over with you?

1229
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
 If you're here and you're headed to launch

1230
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
 and you want to serve others at launch

1231
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
 and head up to the loft and jump into our leaders meeting

1232
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
 and if you're in other towns

1233
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
 there's opportunities for you to serve there.

1234
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
 Connect with your leaders.

1235
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
 Come.

1236
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
 Go.

1237
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
 Worship the King who gave himself for you.

1238
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
 In Jesus' name be free.

1239
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
 Bless you.
