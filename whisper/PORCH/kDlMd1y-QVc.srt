 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:25,940
 Love it.

3
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,440
 Love it.

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
 So intense.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,980
 Tonight, we're starting a new series.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,000
 Like you heard a few minutes ago, called Game of Thrones.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,840
 And I'm going to start us off with kind of a story that'll

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,920
 tell us where we're going.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,080
 Anyone road trip fans out there?

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,240
 A few.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,480
 Well, I'm going to let you in on my favorite road trip

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,120
 experience.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,160
 I love road trips.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,240
 And we called this the Epic Eastern Extravaganza, which

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,680
 is super nerdy and embarrassing.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,160
 But you'll understand why we called it that.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,740
 It was with me and three of my friends.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,360
 And in college, we had a spring break

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,400
 where we decided, hey, we're going

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,660
 to go on a road trip together.

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,960
 So me, three guys, we're going to get in the car,

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,680
 and we're going to go on a road trip.

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
 And so we get on the car.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,200
 The day comes, and we haven't planned out anything

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,320
 on where we're going to go.

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,160
 And so we literally get in the car and go,

27
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,360
 where should we go?

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,680
 And people are throwing out ideas.

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,680
 And then one guy says, hey, let's go to Memphis.

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,480
 That's east.

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,880
 We wanted to go east.

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
 And so we book a La Quinta in Memphis, and we take off.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,160
 And so we go to Memphis.

34
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,040
 And he wanted to see Graceland, which

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,720
 is Elvis' home.

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
 And he wanted to see all the different things in Memphis.

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,580
 And so we walked around the town.

38
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,360
 We saw Memphis, all that it had to offer.

39
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,960
 We walked.

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,040
 We were walking in Memphis.

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,280
 We had the barbecue in Memphis.

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,560
 We had everything that you could experience in Memphis.

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,400
 And then we realized, hey, where should we go next?

44
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,000
 And so we decided to keep moving east.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
 And one friend said, hey, I've got friends in Knoxville.

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,760
 Let's go to Knoxville.

47
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,240
 Knoxville's a couple hours east, still in Tennessee.

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,280
 And so on the way there, we stopped in Nashville

49
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,600
 and got to see all that Nashville had to offer.

50
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,940
 Yeah, if you're from Nashville.

51
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,480
 And so we saw Nashville and the sights and the music industry

52
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,480
 and everything that Tulane and just kind of the fun that

53
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,240
 was Nashville.

54
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,200
 And then we continued on the journey to my friend's friends

55
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,280
 in Knoxville.

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,000
 And we got there.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,800
 We saw the Smoky Mountains.

58
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,880
 And we saw the University of Tennessee, the other UT.

59
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
 And we just had the whole Knoxville experience.

60
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,640
 And so then we decided, where should we go next?

61
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,120
 And another guy in the car said, hey,

62
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,900
 I think we should go to Savannah.

63
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,360
 I don't know anyone there, but I did a fourth grade project

64
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,120
 on Savannah.

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,360
 And so let's go to Savannah.

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,000
 So we've got nothing else to do.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
 So we might as well head that way.

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,120
 So we start going off to Savannah.

69
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,040
 And we stop in Charleston, because along the way,

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,760
 another one of the guys said, hey, I

71
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,440
 want to see Charleston, South Carolina.

72
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,280
 So we stopped there.

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,320
 We have lunch.

74
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,520
 We see the shore.

75
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,800
 And then we head to Savannah.

76
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,000
 And we didn't know anyone.

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,920
 And so we decided to stay in the America's Best Value Inn,

78
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,060
 which is a pretty tall claim for America's Best Value Inn.

79
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,300
 And I'm not sure they lived up to the experience of best value

80
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,860
 in America.

81
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,380
 It was a hotel that had seen better days.

82
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,540
 And one of the places that--

83
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,200
 it was a place that if you go in there,

84
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,900
 you don't sleep in the bedding.

85
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,580
 You sleep on top, because you're not sure what's happened here.

86
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,820
 And I don't want what's happened here.

87
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,180
 I'm not sure if what happened at America's Best Value Inn

88
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,660
 stays in America's Best Value Inn and could get on me.

89
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,220
 So we'll sleep on top of it.

90
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,500
 So we stayed at Savannah.

91
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,660
 And then we had a friend, or one of the guys in the car,

92
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,740
 his girlfriend, who was in Florida.

93
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,420
 And so he said, hey, let's go there.

94
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,620
 And somehow he talked us to taking hundreds of miles

95
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,900
 out of the way to go be wingmen for him

96
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,500
 and a bunch of his other girlfriends, which were awesome.

97
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,700
 And so we headed down to Florida and stayed on the beach

98
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,200
 with them.

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,900
 And then we headed to Louisiana.

100
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,180
 And in the car, one of our friends,

101
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,500
 or one of the guys with us, knew people in Baton Rouge

102
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,940
 and said, hey, we can stay there.

103
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,100
 And so we stayed and stayed in Baton Rouge.

104
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,580
 And so that was our final stop.

105
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,500
 And then we headed back to Houston after that.

106
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,620
 It was eight days, 3,500 miles, 10 states.

107
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,460
 And it was a lot of mail in one truck for a lot of miles,

108
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,300
 which still today the car smells from the residue that

109
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,060
 was left over.

110
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,740
 But here's why I tell you that story.

111
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,980
 In that, the journey that we took

112
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,700
 and the destinations that were chosen

113
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,540
 were all influenced and chosen and impacted

114
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,660
 by those of the passengers who made up the vehicle.

115
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,500
 In every stop, in every destination,

116
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,380
 it was chosen and influenced by those

117
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,660
 who were inside of the car.

118
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,060
 Along the journey, those who made up the journey

119
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,060
 helped determine and influence the decisions

120
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,820
 on where we would go.

121
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,820
 Life is, in a very similar way, a journey that all of us

122
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,900
 are on.

123
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,860
 And the decisions about the destinations

124
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,420
 of where your life is headed towards in any arena of life,

125
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,540
 whether it's a marital destination, where you want

126
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,460
 to be someday financially, whether you

127
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,980
 want to head towards a destination in your character,

128
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,140
 your life is a journey that will be

129
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,100
 and is being shaped by the passengers or the people who

130
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,780
 are with you on that journey.

131
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,300
 That those who are closest to you

132
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,060
 are influencing the direction and the destination,

133
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,780
 ultimately, of where you are going in life.

134
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,420
 And this really isn't hard to see,

135
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,820
 that those who are closest to us,

136
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,180
 just the power of association in our life,

137
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,060
 those who are closest to us influence us the most.

138
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,660
 And we can see this, really, when you look back through life,

139
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,700
 you can really tell this.

140
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,740
 When you look at junior high and you

141
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,620
 see how we all had the same haircut, the bowl cut,

142
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,380
 or you look at how you dress similar to your friends,

143
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,420
 you wore the sambas or the jingos.

144
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,900
 No one wears jingos alone.

145
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,020
 You only wear those for a very particular group of friends.

146
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,540
 All of your life has been shaped.

147
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,900
 In high school, the car you drove,

148
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,860
 the car you wanted to drive was shaped

149
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,020
 by the people and the persons who were in your life,

150
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,780
 the relationships.

151
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,140
 Your college experience was likely

152
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,700
 shaped in a good way or in a bad way

153
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,420
 by the people who were with you on that journey

154
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,080
 through college.

155
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,260
 Maybe your college, you had people around you

156
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,340
 who valued learning or who valued doing well.

157
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,220
 And so they encouraged you on a Friday night

158
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,660
 or on a night before an exam to stay home and study.

159
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,740
 And maybe you didn't do so hot your first semester

160
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,740
 of freshman year because you were surrounded

161
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,780
 by people who thought, hey, you can always retake a class.

162
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,220
 You can't retake a good time.

163
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,140
 Let's do this.

164
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,180
 And so they impacted you.

165
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,540
 But the people that are around us,

166
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,420
 the relationships that are closest to us

167
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,700
 will make the deepest and most significant impact

168
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,260
 on our life.

169
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
 It's just something we see.

170
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,700
 And so here's why that's so significant.

171
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,580
 Here's where we're going tonight as we set up

172
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,060
 this series on Game of Thrones.

173
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,660
 I think we all would say, yeah, that's true.

174
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,740
 The people in our lives, the relationships, our friends

175
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,260
 are going to have a role and influence

176
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,020
 and determine the direction of our life.

177
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,300
 But I'm not sure how much of a role

178
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,540
 and is it really that significant.

179
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,260
 And so tonight, we're going to explore

180
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,940
 the life of an Old Testament king.

181
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,180
 We're going to be in the book of First Kings,

182
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,500
 if you have a Bible you can fit there,

183
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,340
 where he shows us how crucial, how crucial this idea

184
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,780
 and this principle is of those who are with you in life,

185
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,460
 those who are closest to you in a relationship

186
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,260
 will make the most significant impact on your life.

187
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,980
 Here's the way we said it.

188
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,620
 Your friends show you a forecast of your future.

189
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,640
 Your friendships and my friendships, my friends,

190
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,900
 the people that are closest to us

191
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,180
 show us a forecast of our future

192
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,660
 because they determine the decisions and the direction

193
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,820
 and ultimately the destinations in our lives

194
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,660
 as we journey through life.

195
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,260
 So Game of Thrones, I'm gonna set up

196
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,660
 just a little bit about this series

197
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,280
 and where we are even in the Bible.

198
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,820
 So if you're in First Kings, you can open your Bible

199
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,020
 and it's in what's called the Old Testament in the Bible.

200
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,460
 This will be kind of review for some of you

201
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,100
 and maybe new for some of you.

202
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,340
 The Bible is broken into two parts primarily.

203
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,580
 There's the Old Testament and the New Testament.

204
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,420
 Yeah, good.

205
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,660
 So the Old Testament and the New Testament.

206
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,400
 The Old Testament is a study of the story of God's people.

207
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,820
 It's God's nation of Israel

208
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,580
 and so it traces the story of God's chosen people.

209
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,580
 Then we get to the New Testament

210
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,060
 and it's introduced through the church and Jesus

211
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,400
 and he establishes a broader group of people.

212
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,420
 So the Old Testament, when you read it,

213
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,700
 you're reading the history and the story

214
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,580
 of the nation of Israel who God said,

215
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,420
 "You will be my chosen people."

216
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,980
 And so in the Age of Kings,

217
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,460
 what's interesting about the Age of Kings,

218
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,420
 which is where we get this,

219
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,460
 Game of Thrones is a study of the kings of Israel.

220
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,580
 It wasn't always that there were kings in Israel

221
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,420
 and you may not have ever heard this before,

222
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,800
 but the nation of Israel for 500 years,

223
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,300
 once they were established and you can read about that

224
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,260
 in Genesis, Exodus, in those first few books,

225
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,340
 once they were established,

226
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,940
 they had 500 years with no king.

227
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,260
 They were a nation ruled by law.

228
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,620
 And what's interesting about that

229
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,940
 is this was something the world had never seen

230
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,220
 and not until the founding of this country,

231
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,460
 United States,

232
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,340
 would they see and be introduced into it again,

233
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,720
 that we will not be ruled by a king.

234
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,660
 You won't have a king, you will be ruled by law

235
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,660
 and ultimately God will be your king.

236
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,820
 And so the nation of Israel, 500 years in,

237
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,300
 decided, "Hey, I wanna have a king.

238
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,140
 "We want a king.

239
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,660
 "We're out there talking to the other nations

240
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,960
 "and they're like, 'Yeah, this is our king.

241
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
 "'Where's your king?'

242
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,620
 "Well, we don't have a king."

243
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,540
 And so, "We want a king, give us a king."

244
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,700
 And so they demand that God would give them a king.

245
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,360
 He said, "You don't want a king.

246
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,580
 "They're gonna do what kings do.

247
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,760
 "They're gonna take your daughters.

248
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,780
 "They're gonna take your land.

249
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,920
 "They're gonna take your money.

250
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,460
 "You don't want a king.

251
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,620
 "We wanna be like all the other nations."

252
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,060
 That's the point, you're not like all the other nations.

253
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,600
 And so because they wouldn't relent,

254
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,580
 God said, "All right, we'll give them a king."

255
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,500
 And so tonight, we're gonna study the fourth king of Israel

256
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,700
 and a man by the name of Rehoboam.

257
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,420
 Rehoboam, and you probably have never heard of Rehoboam,

258
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,460
 but you should know about his father and his grandfather.

259
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,700
 His father was Solomon and his grandfather

260
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,380
 was arguably the most famous king of all, David.

261
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,260
 And so the king lineage went like this.

262
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,140
 God says, "Fine, give them a king."

263
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,280
 And he appoints Saul.

264
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,780
 And Saul is like the Disney prince king.

265
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,580
 He's the guy that looks tall, he's handsome.

266
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,460
 He's like what you see when you go to Disney World today.

267
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,540
 He's a guy that was taller than everybody else

268
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,820
 and it went really, really badly for Saul.

269
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
 And so God replaces him with David.

270
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,940
 And David is a man that's called after God's own heart

271
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,500
 and he does really, really well

272
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,860
 with the exception of one event with Bathsheba.

273
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,340
 And so after David and David of Bathsheba, David's son,

274
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,420
 Solomon takes over when David dies.

275
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,660
 And Solomon starts out really, really well.

276
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,980
 God gives him more wisdom

277
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,060
 than anyone who had ever lived before.

278
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,660
 And then in the middle of his life,

279
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,940
 Solomon turned away from God

280
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,220
 because of going after foreign women.

281
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,460
 And so as a punishment for the disobedience

282
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,660
 of turning away from God,

283
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,580
 God said, "I'm going to rip the kingdom

284
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,540
 "from your son's hands.

285
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,080
 "And I won't do it until after you die to honor David,

286
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,860
 "but I'm gonna rip the kingdom from your son's hand

287
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,740
 "and give half of the kingdom

288
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,260
 "or a majority of the kingdom to Jeroboam."

289
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,300
 And so that's where the story picks up

290
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,620
 and Solomon decides, "Hey, I'm not gonna let that happen."

291
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,540
 So he chases down Jeroboam

292
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,380
 and Jeroboam flees to Egypt.

293
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,740
 And I know these are like really exciting names.

294
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,420
 We don't use Jeroboam and Rehoboam anymore,

295
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,460
 probably because of the story we're about to read.

296
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,500
 But Jeroboam flees to Egypt and eventually Solomon dies.

297
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,760
 And that's where our story picks up

298
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,940
 because Rehoboam is the successor.

299
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,860
 He's gonna be the king, the next king of Israel.

300
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,980
 And we're gonna explore one of the most catastrophic events

301
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,380
 in Israel's history.

302
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,300
 We're gonna be in 1 Kings 12.

303
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,940
 You can open up your Bible to 1 Kings 12.

304
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,700
 If you hit Chronicles, you've gone too far.

305
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,960
 So back up, back up.

306
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,040
 And as we explore the age of kings,

307
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,260
 we're gonna start in verse one.

308
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,640
 It'll be on the screens if you don't have a Bible.

309
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,860
 Now, Rehoboam went to Shechem,

310
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,780
 which was just a city where they anointed the kings.

311
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,340
 For all of Israel had gone there to make him king.

312
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,540
 So Solomon dies, his son Rehoboam goes to Shechem,

313
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,580
 he's gonna be made king,

314
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,140
 and all of Israel gathers around.

315
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,100
 It's like Lion King, with the baby being hold up.

316
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,900
 All of Israel gathers around to make him king.

317
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,740
 And so everyone's standing there and this is what happens.

318
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,820
 When Jeroboam, he was the other figure,

319
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,860
 son of Nebat heard this, he was still in Egypt,

320
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,500
 for he had fled there from King Solomon.

321
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,980
 He returned from Egypt.

322
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,700
 So Jeroboam hears Solomon's dead, I can finally come home.

323
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,780
 He comes back.

324
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,380
 So they sent for Jeroboam, that's Israel,

325
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,980
 and he and the whole assembly of Israel

326
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,180
 went to Rehoboam and said,

327
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,380
 "Your father put a heavy yoke on us."

328
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,020
 So all of Israel gathers together

329
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,980
 and Jeroboam's kind of a spokesperson,

330
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,340
 and they say, "Tell him this, tell Rehoboam this,

331
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
 "we want him to be king,

332
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,700
 "but here's what we want you to ask him to do.

333
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,340
 "Your father put a heavy yoke on us,

334
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,460
 "but now lighten the harsh labor

335
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,540
 "and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."

336
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,300
 And in other words, Solomon,

337
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,340
 or I mean, Solomon, your father, Rehoboam,

338
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,140
 he was always having us build things,

339
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,300
 he was always taxing us, he built tons of palaces.

340
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,620
 Can we just get a break?

341
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,860
 Can you lighten the load that your father put on us?

342
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,780
 Can we not have another building campaign?

343
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,620
 Can we not have as much in taxes taken away from us?

344
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,660
 Will you lighten the yoke on us?

345
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,260
 We want you to be king, but will you lighten up?

346
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,620
 And Rehoboam does something very wise, verse five.

347
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,580
 He answered, "Go away for three days,

348
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,300
 "and then come back to me."

349
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,940
 So the people went away, so they all go away.

350
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,820
 And so Rehoboam takes time to process this decision.

351
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,980
 It's a very important decision,

352
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,780
 it's the first decision that he would make.

353
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,380
 There's a lot at stake.

354
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,580
 Then, verse six, he does another smart thing.

355
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,800
 "Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders

356
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,040
 "who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime.

357
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,660
 "How would you advise me to answer these people?"

358
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,020
 So again, Rehoboam does something very smart.

359
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,020
 He's facing a decision, and he does something

360
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,080
 that all of us in the room need to learn to do

361
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,940
 when facing a decision of great importance

362
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,820
 or any importance in our life.

363
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,140
 When making decisions, start by seeking direction

364
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,460
 from others.

365
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,380
 When you and I are faced with making a decision

366
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,380
 about who to date, where to live, what house to buy,

367
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,780
 and any decision, whether you're gonna switch jobs,

368
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,140
 Rehoboam models something that is very, very crucial

369
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,140
 and God speaks to constantly in the scriptures.

370
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,680
 When you are faced with making a decision,

371
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,220
 go and seek direction from others in your life.

372
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,060
 That one of the key ways that God speaks to you

373
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,580
 and God speaks to me is through wise counselors

374
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,700
 or through his people in our life,

375
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,380
 and they have been given to us to protect us

376
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,540
 from making a foolish decision.

377
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,420
 And Rehoboam does something very wise,

378
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,740
 and here's why it's so wise,

379
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,240
 is because there are certain decisions

380
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,660
 in your life and my life where the emotion of the decision,

381
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,820
 hey, we're in love, or I just want this house so bad,

382
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,500
 can blind us from doing something that is right

383
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,460
 or can make us or lead us to do something

384
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,100
 that will lead us towards a destructive path.

385
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,980
 There are certain decisions in all of our lives

386
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,460
 where we just can't see it as much as we want to,

387
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,140
 and we look at other people's lives

388
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,420
 and it's much easier to see.

389
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,740
 I mean, all of us have had friends

390
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,860
 that we've seen them make decisions where you go,

391
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,060
 what were you thinking when you decided to date him?

392
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,380
 He just got out of prison.

393
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,060
 What were you thinking when you decided to buy that,

394
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,340
 when you decided to stay there,

395
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,660
 when you decided to go there,

396
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,540
 when you decided to quit that job?

397
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,860
 And we think, someone with a third grade IQ

398
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,340
 could have looked at this situation

399
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,340
 and told you this is not a good idea.

400
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,660
 But as easy as it is for us to see,

401
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,940
 in the moment for that person and for you and for me,

402
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,480
 there are decisions that you will face

403
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,140
 where you will be unable to see

404
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,220
 and to really act wisely on what you should do.

405
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,460
 And so he models for us, all of us have been given by God,

406
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,860
 others in our lives that we are to,

407
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,820
 when making a decision, start by seeking a direction

408
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,660
 from others around us.

409
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,780
 He learned this from his father, Solomon.

410
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,980
 And here's why this is so interesting to me about Solomon.

411
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,140
 Solomon wrote the book of Proverbs.

412
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,260
 If you have your Bible, or if you have a Bible

413
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,540
 and you flipped it halfway open,

414
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,860
 you hit somewhere near the book of Proverbs.

415
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,420
 It's called the book of wisdom.

416
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,620
 And Solomon wrote the book of wisdom

417
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,300
 and he's the wisest man who ever lived.

418
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,340
 And one of the topics he said more about

419
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,620
 than almost any other topic

420
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,380
 was seeking counsel from others.

421
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,740
 Think about that.

422
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,440
 The wisest man who ever lived.

423
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,420
 If there was one person in the history of the world

424
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,820
 who could go without seeking counsel from other people,

425
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,700
 I mean, he's wiser than everybody he talks to,

426
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,540
 it'd be Solomon.

427
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,900
 And yet he says more about seeking counsel from others

428
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,900
 or don't make a decision without consulting other people

429
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,880
 who can see the situation clearly.

430
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,320
 He says more about that topic

431
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,060
 than anyone else in all of scripture

432
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,120
 because he's the wisest man who ever lived.

433
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,860
 So here's just a few because there's so many,

434
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,340
 we really can't even go through all of them.

435
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,740
 Here's a handful of them.

436
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,020
 Proverbs 15, 22.

437
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,420
 Plans fail.

438
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,820
 If you have plans, here's how they're going to fail.

439
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,780
 If you have plans to get married,

440
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,180
 if you have plans to buy a home,

441
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,960
 if you have plans to success in your job

442
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,140
 or wherever you are, if you have plans,

443
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,600
 they fail for lack of counsel.

444
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,460
 But with many advisors, they succeed.

445
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,740
 Proverbs 11, 14.

446
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,100
 Where there is no guidance, a people or a nation falls.

447
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,880
 But in an abundance of counselors, there is safety.

448
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,140
 Proverbs 12, 15.

449
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,700
 The way of fools seems right to them.

450
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,740
 Like a fool will think,

451
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,700
 oh, this is for sure the right decision.

452
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,500
 Oh, we should definitely date.

453
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,940
 We should definitely get engaged.

454
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,440
 We should definitely move in.

455
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,200
 But the wise listen to advice.

456
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,660
 And you are making decisions in this period of your life,

457
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,500
 this season and in this season of my life

458
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,300
 that are distinct from almost any other season

459
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,560
 of life that you'll face.

460
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,700
 Like the decisions you make in your 20s and in your 30s

461
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,680
 will impact the direction and course of your life

462
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,760
 in ways that almost no other decade of your life will.

463
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,620
 Who you're gonna marry, where you're gonna work,

464
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,280
 where you're gonna live, what you're gonna do for work.

465
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,940
 And Solomon says to you, and God says to all of us,

466
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,340
 one of the key gifts I've given you

467
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,740
 is that you would seek out counsel

468
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,580
 from other people in your life when making decisions.

469
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,360
 Start by seeking direction.

470
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,120
 So here's what they respond to him

471
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,580
 as he asked them for direction.

472
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,560
 Verse seven, they replied,

473
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,680
 if today you will be a servant to these people

474
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,720
 and serve them and give them a favorable answer,

475
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,120
 they will always be your servants.

476
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,920
 Basically, the elders tell Rehoboam,

477
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,960
 hey, if you will be a servant to these people,

478
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,160
 it's going to go well for you.

479
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,200
 Lessen the load, lighten the load.

480
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,360
 And had Rehoboam taken this advice,

481
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,760
 the story would have gone totally different

482
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,680
 from where it's about to go.

483
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,480
 But he makes a very foolish decision.

484
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,800
 After making a wise decision, seeking others' input,

485
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,980
 he makes a very foolish decision.

486
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,920
 Verse eight, but Rehoboam rejected the advice

487
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,800
 the elders gave him and consulted the young men

488
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,080
 who had grown up with him and were serving him.

489
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,120
 And he asked them, what is your advice?

490
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,800
 How should we answer these people who say to me,

491
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,120
 lighten the yoke?

492
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,360
 So Rehoboam rejects their advice

493
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,400
 and he goes to the younger men who had grown up with him.

494
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,120
 He goes to his high school buddies and says,

495
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,560
 I don't like the advice that they gave me.

496
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,100
 What do you think that we should do?

497
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,200
 The young men who had grown up to him replied,

498
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,320
 verse 10, these people have said to you,

499
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,620
 your father put a heavy yoke on us,

500
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,680
 but make our yoke lighter.

501
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,280
 Now tell them, my little finger,

502
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,100
 this is probably gonna be shock value,

503
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,200
 is thicker than your father's waist or your father's loins,

504
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,720
 if you have another translation, which is literally the word.

505
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,560
 In other words,

506
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,800
 I am more of a man than my dad is, is what he's pointing at,

507
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
 but you should read your Bible, that's in your Bible.

508
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,520
 My little finger is thicker than my father's package.

509
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,660
 And so my father laid a, that's what it says,

510
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,640
 my father laid a heavy yoke on you

511
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,360
 and I will make it even heavier, he says.

512
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,000
 Tell them that you're more of a man than your father.

513
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,280
 My father, tell them this, my father scourged you with whips

514
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,820
 but I will scourge you with scorpions.

515
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,280
 In other words, hey, don't lighten up,

516
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,540
 tell the people you're not lightening up,

517
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,960
 you're gonna make it even worse.

518
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,380
 Tell them about the scorpions,

519
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,400
 you're gonna bring out scorpions out of these people

520
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,920
 and tell them about your dad's package,

521
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,400
 bring out the scorpions.

522
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,680
 (congregation laughing)

523
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,280
 And here's why I'm making fun of that,

524
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,080
 is anyone can see reading that this is not good advice.

525
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,240
 I mean, it's not hard to think,

526
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,120
 oh my gosh, don't do it, Rehoboam,

527
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,320
 this is terrible advice that you're getting

528
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,840
 from the young men, your high school buddies,

529
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,000
 who work for you.

530
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,880
 Of course they want you to increase the load.

531
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,440
 It's easy to see, unless you're Rehoboam.

532
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,840
 And he introduces us to a quality about Rehoboam

533
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,000
 that I think is in all of us.

534
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
 He wasn't looking for wise advice,

535
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,160
 he was looking for affirmation.

536
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,100
 He was looking for advice that he wanted to hear.

537
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,540
 It's not dissimilar from situations

538
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,300
 where maybe you're dating a guy

539
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,260
 and your friends go, he's trouble,

540
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
 I don't think you should date him.

541
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,980
 And you just go, well, I'm gonna get new friends,

542
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,220
 I'm just gonna move on.

543
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:27,420
 And so Rehoboam decides and makes a decision

544
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,100
 in the next verse that tells us what's gonna happen.

545
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,260
 Verse 12, three days later,

546
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,780
 Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam

547
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,580
 as the king had said, so come back to me

548
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,180
 in three days, verse 13.

549
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,340
 The king answered the people harshly,

550
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,220
 rejecting the advice given him by the elders.

551
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,580
 He followed the advice of the young men

552
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,020
 and said, my father made your yoke heavy,

553
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,300
 I will make it even heavier.

554
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,580
 My father scourged you with whips,

555
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,700
 I will scourge you with scorpions.

556
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,180
 So the king did not listen to the people,

557
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,060
 for this turn of events was from the Lord

558
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,100
 to fulfill the word of the Lord

559
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,780
 that had been spoken through the prophet Ahijah,

560
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,860
 the Shilonite.

561
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,180
 So here, this brings us to our second point,

562
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,540
 that the life of Rehoboam, tragically,

563
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,940
 as we're gonna see, illustrates that all of us,

564
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,260
 when it comes to choosing counsel,

565
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,820
 must choose counsel carefully.

566
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,660
 Choose who you're going to listen carefully.

567
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,980
 And this is so important, and I don't know if I can,

568
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,660
 in a compelling enough way, communicate this.

569
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,180
 You have to develop the habit of selective hearing.

570
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,740
 We live in a world that's so loud,

571
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,300
 and culture that is so loud,

572
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,700
 and instructs us in so many ways that are foolish.

573
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,940
 And they're like Rehoboam's young high school friends,

574
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,100
 and some of you are surrounded by people

575
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,780
 who are speaking foolish advice to you.

576
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,300
 And the reason that's significant

577
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,980
 is because who you listen to

578
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,140
 will impact and influence what you do.

579
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,340
 Who you're going to listen to

580
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,060
 is eventually gonna impact and influence what you do.

581
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,980
 And to seek out from others around us

582
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,180
 when it comes to advice,

583
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,580
 not people who will just affirm the decision,

584
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,940
 the relationship, whatever it is that we want,

585
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,220
 but people who will speak wise counsel.

586
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,580
 Because if you're just looking for someone to affirm

587
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,940
 whatever decision you're facing,

588
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,700
 in whatever way you think you should go,

589
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,340
 they're out there, and you can find them.

590
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,020
 And they're gonna give you foolish advice.

591
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,780
 Like, of course, you should date him.

592
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,900
 He's a doctor.

593
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,220
 He doesn't speak English, but he's a doctor.

594
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,220
 Well-loved by his people.

595
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,140
 Or people who are gonna say,

596
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,980
 "Hey, you guys should definitely move in together.

597
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,580
 "It makes financial sense."

598
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,380
 Of course, everyone's moving in together.

599
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,020
 You should definitely move in together.

600
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,860
 Or people will say,

601
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,380
 "You should for sure lease that Mercedes."

602
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,740
 Or, "You should sure buy it.

603
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,180
 "It's on sale, and you have a credit card.

604
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,420
 "Let's go."

605
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,260
 Of course you should.

606
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,820
 And there's no shortage of advice,

607
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,100
 but who you listen to.

608
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,660
 And there are so many foolish voices.

609
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,940
 And how do you understand what a foolish voice is?

610
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,100
 A foolish voice or a foolish advice

611
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,580
 for you and for me is any instruction

612
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,380
 that either goes against God's word

613
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,860
 and goes with the crowd,

614
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,820
 or just goes with the crowd

615
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,460
 and goes against a principle in God's word.

616
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,500
 If it goes against what God has said

617
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,900
 or God's people have spoken

618
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,580
 and goes with the crowd, the world around us,

619
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,620
 it's pretty, you can be pretty confident,

620
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,940
 it is foolish advice,

621
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,900
 and it is going to lead you to suffer harm.

622
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:28,620
 And there are those who will tell us

623
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,660
 what you want to hear,

624
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,300
 and it will take you to a place

625
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,740
 that you do not wanna end up.

626
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,140
 And so in learning to listen,

627
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,140
 selective hearing, look for wise counsel,

628
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,980
 not affirmation.

629
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,940
 Here's the second thing I think

630
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,580
 that this illustrates for us,

631
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,860
 is that you and I have to choose friends really carefully.

632
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,420
 Choose those who will be close to us really carefully,

633
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,060
 because here's what's crazy about friendship,

634
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,300
 the power of friendship.

635
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,900
 Your friends and my friends

636
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,260
 at times have more power over us

637
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,860
 than our convictions.

638
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,460
 I mean, that's the power of peer pressure.

639
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,820
 It's like, I know I shouldn't do this,

640
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,620
 but everyone, oh, okay.

641
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,380
 Your friends and my friends,

642
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,060
 think about that,

643
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,100
 have more power over your life

644
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,340
 and your decisions

645
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,780
 than your convictions,

646
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,780
 than what you believe,

647
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,620
 than your theology.

648
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,260
 And they will influence and point you in a direction

649
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,420
 if you are not careful

650
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,980
 that will lead to a destination

651
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,180
 you don't wanna be at.

652
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,780
 And so choose your friends carefully.

653
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,900
 Your life has been shaped

654
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,180
 and my life has been shaped by this.

655
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,100
 Almost any bad decision that you look back on

656
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,780
 or I look back on

657
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,020
 was most likely shaped

658
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,660
 by those who were closest to us speaking into this.

659
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,500
 Like, think about it.

660
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,220
 Like, the first time you got introduced to alcohol,

661
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,380
 it wasn't by yourself behind a 7-Eleven,

662
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,900
 just like, ah.

663
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,380
 Or the first cigarette you smoked

664
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,740
 or the first joint you smoked

665
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,220
 was all influenced by those in your life,

666
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,060
 by a friend.

667
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,420
 That's the power of friendship,

668
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,340
 who you run with.

669
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,180
 And tonight, some of you are running with fools

670
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,140
 and it's going to end badly for you

671
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,700
 as we're gonna see in a second.

672
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,940
 And God who loves you

673
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,260
 is inviting you out of that

674
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,820
 and says, I don't want those who are closest to you

675
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,900
 to be fools.

676
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
 Listen carefully.

677
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
 Choose your friends wisely.

678
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,420
 Your view of sexuality,

679
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,100
 so many different stages in your life

680
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,700
 have been shaped by those who are closest to you

681
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
 because friendship is powerful.

682
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:35,580
 And your life is being shaped by this.

683
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,460
 And some of you guys,

684
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,420
 like we hear it every week,

685
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,220
 like you're still in the party scene

686
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,980
 and you're going, yeah,

687
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,220
 but I'm trying to live on mission.

688
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,140
 Jesus was out there with the partiers.

689
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,620
 You're not Jesus.

690
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,380
 You can't, if you walk on water,

691
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,480
 then you can hang out with foolish people.

692
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,240
 And I'm not talking about living on mission.

693
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,000
 I'm saying those who are closest to you,

694
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,880
 who will influence you the most.

695
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,080
 God says, don't run with fools.

696
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:09,160
 Transition, the aftermath of what happened

697
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,800
 based on him telling these people.

698
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,720
 When all of Israel saw that the king,

699
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,160
 verse 16, refused to listen to them,

700
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,360
 they answered the king.

701
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,440
 So they see the king says,

702
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,680
 I'm gonna make it even heavier.

703
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,880
 There's gonna be scorpions.

704
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,000
 It's gonna be rough.

705
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,560
 They say to the king,

706
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,660
 what share do we have in David,

707
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,000
 which is the line of the king?

708
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,600
 What part in Jesse's son?

709
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,280
 To your intents, Israel,

710
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,080
 look after your own house, David.

711
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,740
 So the Israelites went home.

712
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,280
 They basically say, Rehoboam,

713
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,360
 you take care of you.

714
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,760
 We're gonna take care of us and we're out of here.

715
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,240
 But as for the Israelites

716
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,060
 who were living in the towns of Judah,

717
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,640
 Rehoboam still rolled over them.

718
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,320
 So here's what's happening.

719
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,320
 Judah, Israel was made up of these 12 tribes,

720
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,640
 or 12 states, and only one of the states

721
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,480
 remained underneath the rule of Rehoboam.

722
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
 He lost 90% immediately.

723
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,240
 Like this instant,

724
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,560
 if you've heard of the northern kingdom of Israel

725
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,320
 and the southern kingdom of Judah,

726
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,720
 and you wonder, how did that happen?

727
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,000
 I thought there was one nation.

728
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,200
 And you read the Old Testament,

729
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,480
 this is the moment right here, right here.

730
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,420
 Verse 17.

731
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,960
 Where Israel rebels because Rehoboam

732
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,880
 decided to listen to fools instead of heed wide counsel.

733
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,400
 King Rehoboam is thinking,

734
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,120
 hey, I'm gonna still take control.

735
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,760
 These people, they think they're rebelling,

736
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,580
 but it's not gonna happen.

737
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,420
 Verse 18.

738
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,720
 King Rehoboam sent out Adaram,

739
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,800
 who's in charge of the forced labor,

740
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,960
 to go get people to continue building projects.

741
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,840
 And they literally killed the messenger.

742
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,520
 But all Israel stoned him to death.

743
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,520
 King Rehoboam, however, managed to escape

744
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,760
 and get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.

745
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,920
 So verse 19.

746
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,960
 Israel has been in rebellion

747
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,600
 against the house of David to this day,

748
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
 that the kingdom divided.

749
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,100
 Jeroboam was made king of the north,

750
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,440
 and it would never be the same.

751
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,980
 All because of a decision,

752
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,800
 influenced and directed by fools.

753
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,560
 Which brings us to our third point.

754
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,560
 Direction from fools will bring, not maybe, disaster.

755
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,300
 If you are listening,

756
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,600
 and you are following instruction of,

757
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,560
 hey, yeah, but they're my buddies, fools,

758
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,500
 it will bring disaster into your life.

759
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:42,360
 That as it's been said, if you show me your friends,

760
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,480
 I will show you your future.

761
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,760
 Your future in every arena of life

762
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,460
 is right now being shaped and will be shaped

763
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,820
 by the relationships that you keep.

764
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,920
 Your friends forecast the future that you hold.

765
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:07,080
 Ironically, again, is Solomon, Rehoboam's father,

766
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,120
 had he just listened to his dad,

767
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,280
 who wrote the book of Proverbs for his son,

768
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,800
 speaks about this very idea.

769
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,280
 Here's what he says in Proverbs 13, 20,

770
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,320
 where he says this,

771
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,560
 "Whoever walks or lives with the wise,"

772
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,040
 the word walks, same as lives,

773
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,080
 "Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise."

774
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,120
 So in other words, if you live,

775
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,400
 and you surround yourself by wise people,

776
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,800
 people who live according to God's word,

777
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,000
 which is ancient wisdom,

778
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,360
 that's what instructs their life,

779
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
 or just wise people.

780
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,800
 If you walk with wise people, something happens.

781
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,280
 It gets on you.

782
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,920
 You become wise.

783
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,400
 But the companion of fools,

784
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,640
 here's what I love about this verse.

785
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,360
 But the companion of fools doesn't say,

786
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,560
 we'll become a fool.

787
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,060
 We'll suffer harm.

788
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,160
 That if you hang out and I hang out with foolish people,

789
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,040
 it's not just, hey, you're gonna be a fool.

790
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,000
 You will suffer for it.

791
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,640
 And I have friends today that are not alive

792
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,840
 because they did not heed this principle and this truth.

793
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,440
 And you may have friends that have made financial decisions,

794
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,200
 maybe are facing criminal charges

795
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,960
 because they hung out with fools and it cost them.

796
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,760
 And if you surround yourself,

797
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,660
 but they're my longtime friends and they are fools,

798
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,240
 it's going to cost you.

799
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,800
 And I think the challenge in this subject of like,

800
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,360
 yeah, of course, taking instruction from fools

801
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,440
 is gonna lead to disaster.

802
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
 I would never take direction.

803
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,320
 Is it's hard to see if I'm listening to fools.

804
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,120
 Like, is this person a fool?

805
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,800
 And so again, a fool or a non-fool,

806
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,300
 a wise person,

807
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,600
 the way you can identify am I receiving wise counsel

808
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,680
 is does this line up with what God has spoken

809
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,480
 and what God has said?

810
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,280
 Does this line up with what God has spoken,

811
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,640
 what God has said?

812
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,640
 And if it doesn't, you need to move with real caution,

813
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,040
 real caution and broaden the circle

814
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,320
 and bring other people in on should I date her?

815
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,520
 Should I not date her?

816
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,200
 Yeah, but they said, God just wants me to be happy, right?

817
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
 You need to move with real caution.

818
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,320
 Especially if you are dating someone right now,

819
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,120
 oh my gosh, you have got to hear this

820
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,640
 because you are gonna make decisions that will impact

821
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,120
 and could potentially bring havoc

822
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,080
 into the rest of your life.

823
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,320
 If you are dating someone, oh, I'm begging you,

824
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,880
 please, before you make a decision

825
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,320
 about hey, we're gonna get engaged

826
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,560
 or hey, we're gonna get married,

827
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,920
 if you are the only person who is speaking into it

828
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,760
 that is that a good decision, you are a fool.

829
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,640
 You are a fool, Solomon says.

830
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,380
 And you have silenced one of the ways God speaks to us,

831
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,680
 which is through his people around us.

832
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,160
 Not to control us, but to protect us.

833
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,080
 He speaks in three ways, his spirit, his word

834
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,400
 and his people and if you don't have others

835
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,480
 speaking into that, you are a fool.

836
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,800
 You're a fool.

837
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,560
 And you're headed towards harm.

838
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:25,960
 Rehoboam faced a decision and he sought wise counsel,

839
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,600
 which is really good and then he rejected it

840
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,360
 for counsel that he wanted to hear

841
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,840
 and it cost him everything.

842
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,440
 And it will the same in your life and in my life

843
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,120
 or has a potential to because who we listen to

844
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,280
 will impact what we do and if you show yourself

845
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,040
 your friends or show me your friends

846
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
 or Solomon says, show me your friends

847
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,680
 and I'll show you your future.

848
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,840
 So here's the application I think for tonight.

849
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,620
 There's two for all of us and then there's one really

850
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,040
 that I think applies just to community groups.

851
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,960
 First one is this, you need to rid your life of fools.

852
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,240
 You need to rid your life of fools

853
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,680
 and seek wise counsel in every situation.

854
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,400
 And if you're going, I don't know if I have

855
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,260
 any non-foolish friends, tonight is your night.

856
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,200
 We're gonna change that.

857
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,100
 We wanna invite you after the service to go into this room

858
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,260
 or into this room right down here and go and step into

859
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,860
 what we call open community and be around other believers

860
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,480
 who will speak to you what is true or speak God's word

861
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,140
 and help inform the decisions that you're gonna make.

862
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,560
 And if you haven't made that decision, I'm telling you,

863
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,620
 tonight is your night and you know you need that.

864
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,140
 You're going, yeah, but I got my buddies

865
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,580
 and we were going out last Friday.

866
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:43,500
 Your life will not change in any way that is good

867
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,700
 and it will only be disrupted by the fools

868
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,260
 that you hang out with if they're fools.

869
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,600
 I mean, can you imagine the story even for Israel

870
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,480
 if Rehoboam had done this?

871
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,240
 Hey, I'm gonna rid my life of these fools

872
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,800
 who clearly are a little biased

873
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
 and I'm going to listen to wise counsel.

874
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,520
 Number two, you need to make the decision

875
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,000
 about who will influence your decisions.

876
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,180
 Make the decision about who is gonna influence my decision.

877
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,080
 I'm gonna make the decision about who's gonna speak

878
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,240
 into my decisions in my life.

879
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,280
 That means you may need to change your playmates

880
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,440
 in your playgrounds.

881
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,460
 We say that all the time.

882
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,640
 Now, one of the key ways that God grows us

883
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,160
 is we have to step out of what's behind us

884
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
 and into new relationships

885
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,760
 and you need to change your playmates in your playgrounds.

886
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,320
 If you don't have a group of believers around you

887
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,200
 who give you the collective counsel

888
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,760
 and wisdom of God's word, you need to step into one

889
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,600
 and tonight is your night.

890
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,840
 I mean, even imagine if Rehoboam had done this.

891
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,120
 I think what's so tragic about this

892
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:57,120
 is God wants to speak to you.

893
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,440
 Like he wants you to know his will for your life

894
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,740
 and he wants me to know his will for my life.

895
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,080
 And one of the primary ways he speaks is this

896
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,160
 and what's so weird is we put so much confidence

897
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,800
 in like random speaking things.

898
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,340
 That yeah, I'm confident, God told me to do it

899
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,840
 and then you dig down every week,

900
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,160
 it seems like someone comes up.

901
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,000
 Yeah, God told me I'm supposed to marry her

902
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,640
 and I'm like, really, tell me about that.

903
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,680
 Yeah, well, her name's Sarah and I was opening the Bible

904
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,800
 and I opened it up and it was like,

905
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,360
 oh, Sarah married Abraham.

906
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,520
 My name's not Abraham but I'm a big fan of the name

907
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,640
 and it was like, oh, marry Sarah.

908
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,920
 Oh, I'm supposed to marry Sarah.

909
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,980
 Does she know you?

910
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,280
 No, but I know that I'm supposed to marry her.

911
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,560
 Or of like, I was sitting at this green light

912
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,880
 or this red light and I was like,

913
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,200
 God, if you want me to quit my job,

914
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,960
 just make it turn green.

915
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,280
 And it's like, I could be wrong.

916
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,680
 God may speak that way but I know he speaks

917
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,760
 through other people in his life

918
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,360
 and it's like, we're quick to put lots of confidence.

919
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,280
 There was this green light and no confidence

920
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,000
 and other people around us who wanna speak wise counsel

921
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,800
 over us and some of you have gotta step out

922
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,960
 of the past life and change your playmates.

923
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,060
 And so let me be really clear.

924
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,520
 Am I asking you to change your friends?

925
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,340
 No, I wouldn't.

926
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,640
 Yes, I'm asking you to change your friends.

927
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,720
 That's one of the things that we say around here

928
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,080
 all the time is there's something that is so striking

929
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,560
 and it is how some people change so little

930
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,100
 hanging around here.

931
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,320
 That years will go by and they change so little

932
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,320
 and then there's some people who change so much

933
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,440
 in that same amount of time period

934
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,600
 and the difference is who they run with

935
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,420
 and who they're surrounded by.

936
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,600
 And God is inviting you into that.

937
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,240
 That's why we are just freaks about everyone,

938
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,780
 every person you've ever seen on this stage, on our staff,

939
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,540
 lives in community with other people speaking wisely

940
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,320
 into their life about the decisions they're making

941
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,520
 and about their life.

942
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,700
 And then here's the third one.

943
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,660
 This anybody can play but it's really most applicable

944
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,580
 for people who are in a community group

945
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,340
 is you need to invite those into your community group

946
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,680
 to speak into the decisions that you're making

947
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,600
 with the things that are going on.

948
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,440
 Here's what I mean by that.

949
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,040
 You need to invite them into the decision making process.

950
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,360
 For whatever reason, due to the newness of a group

951
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,680
 or due to the spiritual maturity

952
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,040
 or just due to whatever reason,

953
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,580
 there are people in groups and they'll think,

954
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,400
 I don't know if you should be dating her

955
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,040
 but I don't know if I should tell them

956
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,240
 I don't wanna be judgmental

957
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,200
 and so let's remove that off the table

958
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,260
 and hopefully they'll grow to that point

959
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,440
 but invite others.

960
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,560
 Here's what that looks like.

961
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,360
 Hey, do you think that we should be dating?

962
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,000
 Do you think that I should buy this car?

963
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,920
 Do you think this is a wise decision?

964
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,680
 Do you think that we should get engaged?

965
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,680
 Do you have any red flags about us moving forward?

966
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,080
 Invite them into that until they feel the freedom

967
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,920
 to be a part of it.

968
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,720
 Invite them in and if you're going,

969
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,540
 yeah, but I don't know if I wanna invite them in,

970
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,240
 that's a problem and that probably tells you something

971
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,600
 about the decision that you're facing, that you're making.

972
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:07,060
 When making decisions, start by seeking direction.

973
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,200
 Who you listen to will impact what you do

974
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,160
 and if you show me your friends,

975
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,160
 Ray Balm says, I will show you your future.

976
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,420
 Don't make the mistake of surrounding yourself by fools.

977
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:29,800
 I shared a couple weeks ago about how I was,

978
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,000
 like I didn't have the rebellious stage

979
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,280
 which I'm like really insecure about in my life

980
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,120
 'cause I feel like it's like,

981
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,680
 that would be such an awesome story.

982
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,120
 I was like at VBS with all the church kids in there

983
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,280
 but you were out where?

984
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,120
 And so I like feel that and as I look back,

985
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,200
 I even jokingly said, I just didn't have the like strip

986
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,800
 clubs and we were out, you know, getting snorting stuff

987
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,920
 and then I jokingly said that the DARE program

988
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,040
 was just really effective in my life

989
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,920
 and here's like the truth of that.

990
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,420
 I don't know why that's funny to people every time.

991
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,400
 [audience laughing]

992
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,240
 Really not.

993
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,640
 It's a great program.

994
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,760
 Here's the truth is it wasn't that.

995
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,760
 Like I am so thankful God preserved

996
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,060
 and there's my heart is wicked and dark

997
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,160
 as everybody in the rooms here.

998
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,200
 We're all messed up, really messed up.

999
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,880
 Thank goodness we have a savior

1000
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,280
 but God preserved a lot of those decisions

1001
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,720
 and a lot of those opportunities

1002
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,320
 and a lot of the view of sexuality or alcohol

1003
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,560
 or drugs or any of those things through relationships.

1004
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,440
 It was this principle and some of you maybe

1005
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,360
 can relate to that, that you were spared,

1006
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,920
 that you're not like, yeah, I was snorting Coke.

1007
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,800
 You're like, no, I don't know.

1008
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,120
 I don't even know where I would get Coke

1009
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,960
 if somebody wanted it.

1010
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,920
 I'd be like, here's a beverage.

1011
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,160
 Is this what you wanted?

1012
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,680
 And so you can relate to that

1013
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,000
 and what you need to know is that this is how God works

1014
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,680
 and no matter if that wasn't a part of your past

1015
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,080
 and for whatever reason, some of us just in God's grace,

1016
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,920
 that was, he protected us through those.

1017
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,280
 If that wasn't a part, you can start today

1018
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,320
 and he's inviting you to, to be protected and preserved

1019
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,520
 and invited into God's people to protect you through that

1020
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,560
 'cause that road trip story I shared at the beginning,

1021
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,080
 what's funny about that story is it's like a metaphor

1022
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,680
 for the journey of life but that was not

1023
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,040
 the last destination that those guys

1024
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,640
 really went with me in my life.

1025
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,320
 They were really the way or a huge way

1026
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,400
 in which God influenced and impacted

1027
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,720
 and took the journey of my life.

1028
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,400
 Here's some of the other destinations

1029
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,200
 where I just looked over and it was those same guys

1030
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
 that were sitting there and I'm in Africa

1031
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,680
 doing work in this orphanage and I look over

1032
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,320
 and it's those same guys with me.

1033
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,680
 We're doing ministry work or we're just worshiping in church

1034
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,560
 and I look over and it's those same guys

1035
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,160
 when I'm going through a really hard breakup

1036
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,000
 and I look over and it's those same guys

1037
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 when I was introduced to my wife.

1038
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,480
 It was the same guys.

1039
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,960
 And then fast forward and years later I'm standing there

1040
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,200
 and I'm wearing a tux and my wife comes in in a white dress

1041
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,720
 and I look beside me and it's those same guys,

1042
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,320
 those same guys who really taught me how to read the Bible.

1043
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:29,000
 Who really are a lot of the reason I'm even in ministry

1044
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,880
 because God preserves and protects through relationships.

1045
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,800
 And I say that at the risk that you would be like,

1046
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,880
 yeah, you're just a good, good kid.

1047
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,120
 That's the reality is I'm not, none of us are.

1048
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,540
 But all of us can yield to this principle

1049
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,520
 and move in a direction of a destination

1050
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,840
 where you wanna head towards,

1051
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,920
 whether that's in a happily married

1052
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,520
 to someone who loves Jesus and loves you

1053
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,440
 or whether that's financially free

1054
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,160
 or whether it's a moral and character destination.

1055
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,240
 He invites all of us and this is the way

1056
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,360
 that he's chosen to do it.

1057
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:09,500
 Because you and I will be the sum

1058
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,380
 of the someones in our life.

1059
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:16,280
 You and I will be the sum of the someones

1060
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,300
 that are in your life and in my life.

1061
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,840
 And he's invited us all to be a part of this principle.

1062
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,340
 I'm gonna pray and then the band's gonna come up.

1063
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,680
 (congregation laughing)

1064
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,080
 Father, we thank you for just how you preserve your word.

1065
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,740
 Through ray of home, we thank you that you have

1066
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,780
 given us the gift of others in our life

1067
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,620
 who can speak wise counsel.

1068
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,940
 Would you protect us from seeking

1069
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,980
 and even from making a foolish decision

1070
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,500
 about who, what friends are gonna be the ones

1071
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,780
 who impact our decisions because they are

1072
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,320
 a forecast of our future.

1073
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,460
 Thank you that you have preserved

1074
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,420
 and just the story of the King, Ray of Oam

1075
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,020
 and how much, it's not some children's story,

1076
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,960
 it's a man who lost it all, but he didn't have to.

1077
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,120
 Father, would you protect us, would you surround us,

1078
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,020
 would you stir in our hearts to move

1079
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,820
 and just be obedient to this principle

1080
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,980
 that you protect through your provision

1081
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,900
 for others in relationship in our life.

1082
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,380
 Would you surround us with wise people

1083
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,540
 and help us to get rid of the foolish ones.

1084
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,360
 We love you.

1085
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,520
 I pray for my friends in the room who don't have that.

1086
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,900
 Would you stir their hearts right now

1087
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:36,100
 because they know that they need it to act.

1088
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,600
 This is the day.

1089
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,180
 Amen.

1090
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,020
 Amen.

1091
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:42,860
 Amen.

1092
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,020
 (silence)

1093
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:55,020
