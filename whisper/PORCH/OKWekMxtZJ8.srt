 >> Porch, how we doing?

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,360
 We doing all right tonight?

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,020
 Great to see you.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,760
 Thanks for making it out to all of our Porch Live locations.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,860
 We're so glad you're streaming with us.

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,760
 Hey, really excited for tonight.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,760
 First, I'll just say this because some of you in the room

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,300
 are here for the very first time.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,060
 And you're probably wondering what this is.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,280
 And so it's helpful for me to look at you

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,640
 and just give you a little background on who we are.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
 The Porch exists to call any and every young adult

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,480
 to see Jesus and surrender fully to life with him.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,320
 That's who we are.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,920
 That's what you're a part of tonight.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,360
 And when we say any and every young adult, we mean it.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
 We really do.

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,980
 I was talking to the Lord earlier this morning

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,980
 and I was like, God, I know that your heart is one

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,400
 where you want saints and sinners and skeptics

24
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,960
 and seekers to all gather into this space.

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,560
 So if you're here and you have questions,

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,500
 you're in the right place.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,160
 If you're here and you've been walking with the Lord

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,400
 for a long time, you're in the right place.

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,280
 And if you're here by mistake,

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
 I promise you're in the right place.

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,840
 So we're really glad that you would join us

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,680
 here this evening.

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,820
 And I'm really excited for where we're going

34
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,840
 because tonight we have a very special guest

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,220
 in the room with us for the second time this year.

36
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,260
 We've got Mr. Nate Hilgenkamp in the house.

37
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,660
 Give it up for Nate, if you would.

38
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,760
 Nate is one of the teaching pastors at Harris Creek.

39
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,240
 He's a co-host of Becoming Something podcast.

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,600
 But way more than all of that, that's awesome.

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,000
 Nate's just an incredible human being.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,660
 Like he's someone that we dearly love here at the Ports

43
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,640
 that I'm grateful to call a really good friend.

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,360
 And I genuinely believe,

45
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,900
 and I need y'all to hear me when I say this,

46
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,380
 'cause I'm not just paying him empty lip service.

47
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,720
 I genuinely believe is one of the leading voices

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,740
 when it comes to Bible teaching for our generation.

49
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,340
 And so we're really blessed to have you here, man.

50
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,300
 Thanks for making the time to join us tonight.

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,660
 Would y'all do a great job of welcoming

52
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,140
 Nate Hilgenkamp to the stage.

53
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,700
 (congregation applauding)

54
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,540
 - Thank you, brother. - Appreciate you.

55
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,200
 - Love you, brother.

56
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,060
 Well, I wanna start with this.

57
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,620
 Recently, my wife and I, we had a disagreement

58
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,780
 that's still unresolved.

59
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,960
 And I thought, you know,

60
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,000
 there's no better way to resolve this conflict

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,960
 than to let you decide who was right or wrong,

62
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,720
 which is just great marriage advice.

63
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,360
 Like whenever you and your wife disagree,

64
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,800
 you and your husband disagree someday,

65
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,960
 just ask other people who's right or wrong.

66
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
 So would you help me out?

67
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,800
 I'm gonna tell you what the disagreement was

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,360
 and let me know who was right or wrong.

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,760
 The disagreement was this.

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,580
 I saw a picture of a shoe online

71
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,960
 and the disagreement we had over this shoe

72
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,980
 wasn't whether or not this shoe was cool.

73
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,480
 The disagreement we had was over the color of this shoe.

74
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,640
 So I think we've got a picture of it.

75
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,580
 Check out this shoe.

76
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,960
 Yeah.

77
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,720
 So I've got a question.

78
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,800
 How many of you, how many of you like me

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,600
 see this shoe and you see it as teal and gray?

80
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,640
 Keep those hands raised.

82
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,100
 Those are the saved people in the room tonight.

83
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,860
 Now how many of you, like my wife,

84
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,140
 see that shoe and see it as pink and white?

85
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,900
 Yeah.

86
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,740
 Crazy, crazy.

87
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,940
 Like this makes no sense to me.

88
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,340
 How can it be that all of us are looking at the same thing

89
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,780
 and see two different things?

90
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,020
 Now let me tell you who's right.

91
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,040
 Let me tell you who's right

92
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,820
 because I did some research on this

93
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,840
 'cause I couldn't believe it.

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,660
 My wife saw one thing, I saw a different thing

95
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,900
 and it just blew my mind so I did a lot of research

96
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,900
 and I found out that Vans, the type of shoe that is,

97
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,660
 they don't make a teal and gray shoe.

98
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,220
 Yeah, yeah.

99
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,820
 So unfortunately my wife was right.

100
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,020
 They are pink and white.

101
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,740
 And you see, it just blew my mind.

102
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,420
 Like I think it just has blown yours.

103
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,440
 Like how can two people look at the same thing

104
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,720
 and come to two very different conclusions?

105
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,080
 And as I've been thinking about that,

106
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,240
 I've realized this happens all the time,

107
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,600
 that two people look at the exact same thing

108
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,880
 and come away with two different conclusions.

109
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,260
 The thing is most of the time,

110
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,880
 it's not just about the color of a shoe.

111
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,440
 Like that's a very low cost to get wrong.

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,700
 But there's a lot of other situations

113
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,080
 where two people look at the same thing

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,460
 and they come to two different conclusions.

115
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,420
 For example, maybe you've had two people in your life

116
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,660
 each go through a breakup

117
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,700
 and they each saw it very differently.

118
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,100
 One of them goes through a breakup

119
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,420
 and they see that breakup and they go,

120
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,020
 this is the worst thing that has ever happened to me.

121
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,300
 I'm unlovable, I'm undesirable.

122
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,580
 The other person can go through a breakup,

123
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,180
 see that breakup and go, this is really, really hard.

124
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,300
 And yet I know I'm still loved.

125
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,060
 I know I'm still desired

126
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,380
 and I can't wait to see what happens next.

127
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,100
 You see, how can two people each see the same thing

128
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,900
 and come to two very different conclusions?

129
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,860
 And here's how, and I'm just gonna give away my message.

130
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,300
 It all comes down to who you trust.

131
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,420
 Who you trust changes the lens you view your life through.

132
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,320
 Who you trust changes the conclusions

133
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,540
 that you will come to in your life.

134
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,600
 And I just want you to know tonight, Porgs,

135
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,220
 most people will come to the wrong conclusion.

136
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,500
 Most people will see their life the wrong way.

137
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,000
 Friends, I just don't want that to be you.

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,100
 So tonight, what we're gonna do

139
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,820
 is we're gonna do a little study of scripture

140
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,420
 to try to figure out how we can see things in our life

141
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,860
 the right way.

142
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,060
 And we're gonna do that by opening up the word of God

143
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,040
 to the book of Numbers.

144
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,700
 Kylan said I could teach on really anything

145
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,460
 and I'm like, let's do the book of Numbers.

146
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,900
 I bet they haven't listened to that or read that in a while.

147
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,420
 So the book of Numbers is the number four book

148
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,940
 in the Bible, Numbers 13 and 14

149
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,980
 is where we're gonna be Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers.

150
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,740
 And we're gonna read a story

151
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,120
 where 12 men all saw the same thing,

152
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,820
 but they didn't all come to the same conclusion.

153
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,100
 12 men saw the same thing,

154
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,500
 they didn't come to the same conclusion.

155
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,540
 So Numbers chapter 13, that's where we're gonna be.

156
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,500
 And just to set up where we're at in the book of Numbers,

157
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,020
 because I bet a lot of you are like, man,

158
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,640
 I have no idea what's going on

159
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,500
 leading up to this point in scripture.

160
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,380
 Well, Numbers 13 is about a year and a half

161
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,120
 after the Exodus.

162
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,100
 So the Exodus was whenever the Israelites

163
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
 were enslaved in Egypt,

164
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,380
 God appeared to a man named Moses and he said,

165
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,100
 Moses, I'm going to use you to lead my people

166
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,300
 up out of slavery and into freedom.

167
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,860
 So Moses goes to Pharaoh and says,

168
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,180
 let God's people go and Pharaoh says, no.

169
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,140
 So what happens next is God brings plague

170
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,360
 after plague after plague upon Pharaoh and the Egyptians

171
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,360
 until finally Pharaoh says, okay, fine, get out of here.

172
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,080
 And as the Israelites are getting out of there,

173
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,960
 they come up against the sea.

174
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,320
 And once they're up against the sea,

175
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,560
 they think they're free only to turn around

176
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
 and see that Pharaoh had changed his mind.

177
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,280
 And Pharaoh and his armies are tracking them down

178
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,720
 and they're up against the sea and they go,

179
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,920
 Moses, we're gonna die.

180
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,720
 And then Moses goes to God and says,

181
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,120
 God, have you brought us out here to die?

182
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,160
 And God says, absolutely not.

183
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,740
 So he splits the sea and the Israelites

184
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,420
 walk through on dry ground.

185
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,860
 And then the Egyptians pursue them into the sea.

186
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,800
 God closes the sea and then they perish in that sea.

187
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,540
 So the Israelites walk onto the other side of the sea

188
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,300
 only to appear in a desert.

189
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,340
 So this isn't like some exciting type of freedom.

190
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,780
 They're like, man, we want to go back to Egypt

191
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,260
 because we have no food to eat here.

192
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,580
 So they go, Moses, have you brought us out here to die?

193
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,940
 And Moses goes to God and he goes,

194
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,080
 God, have you brought us out here to die?

195
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,180
 And God says, absolutely not.

196
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,440
 And then he provides manna, which was a form of bread

197
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,880
 every single day for them in this desert.

198
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,000
 Then they continue to journey through the desert

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,760
 and we pick up on this story when they're on the edge

200
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,480
 of what we know as the promised land.

201
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,660
 The land that God had promised them way back in Egypt

202
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,740
 that he would eventually give to them.

203
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,680
 So they're standing on the edge of this promised land

204
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,680
 looking over into it and Moses decides to do one thing.

205
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,540
 He takes 12 men, 12 men from each of the 12 tribes of Israel

206
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,340
 in Genesis, there was a man named Jacob,

207
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,820
 later renamed Israel.

208
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,660
 He had 12 sons and Moses picked 12 men

209
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,040
 from the 12 tribes of Israel and sends them

210
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,960
 into the promised land as spies.

211
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,460
 And he tells them, figure out all you possibly can

212
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,300
 about this land.

213
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,480
 Survey the people of the land,

214
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,880
 survey the cities in this land,

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,120
 survey the fruit of this land, the terrain of this land.

216
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,640
 We want to know everything we possibly can about this land.

217
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,680
 So these men go into the promised land

218
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,640
 and spend 40 days in this land.

219
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
 And they look at the people, they look at the terrain,

220
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,320
 they look at the cities and they even cut down some fruit.

221
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,680
 In fact, scripture says in Numbers chapter 13

222
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,440
 that they cut down clusters of grapes,

223
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,040
 but the grapes were so large,

224
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,480
 they had to carry them back on poles,

225
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,500
 which sounds like an exaggeration.

226
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,640
 But here's a picture of the clusters of grapes

227
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,440
 grown in this region today.

228
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,520
 It is like the perfect region for growing grapes

229
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
 and other fruits.

230
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,220
 So these are the types of clusters

231
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,440
 that they're bringing back to the people of God.

232
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,460
 It also says that they cut down pomegranates

233
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,160
 and figs as well.

234
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,920
 And after surveying this promised land for 40 days,

235
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,440
 they come back with a report for the people of God.

236
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,780
 And they say this in Numbers 13, verse 26.

237
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,780
 They came back to Moses and Aaron

238
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,840
 and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh

239
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,640
 in the desert of Paran.

240
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,360
 There they reported to them and the whole assembly

241
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,380
 and showed them the fruit of the land.

242
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,660
 They gave Moses this account.

243
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,320
 We went into the land which you sent us

244
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,740
 and it does flow with milk and honey.

245
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,280
 In fact, here's its fruit.

246
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,900
 But the people who live there are powerful

247
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,320
 and the cities are fortified and very large.

248
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,280
 We even saw the descendants of Anak there.

249
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,060
 The Amalekites live in the Negev.

250
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,600
 The Hittites, Jebusites, Amorites live in the hill country

251
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,780
 and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.

252
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,080
 So they go, this land is amazing.

253
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,580
 There's pomegranates and figs and grapes

254
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,120
 and it's flowing with milk and honey.

255
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,620
 Like the land itself is phenomenal,

256
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,520
 but there's some really, really big bad guys there.

257
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,920
 And I don't think they want us to live there.

258
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,740
 So we shouldn't try to live there.

259
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,040
 And the people of God, the Israelites,

260
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,600
 they're all thrown into a panic.

261
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,520
 And this happens next in verse 30.

262
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,660
 Then Caleb, who was one of the other spies,

263
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,980
 silenced the people before Moses.

264
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,600
 And he said, we should go up

265
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 and take possession of the land,

266
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,740
 for we can certainly do it.

267
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,760
 Now the other spies, they start to get nervous

268
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,100
 that the people might believe Caleb's report

269
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,140
 over their reports.

270
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,500
 They just start to make stuff up

271
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,520
 about the land that they've just seen.

272
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,860
 They say this next.

273
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,140
 But the man who had gone up with him said,

274
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,420
 we can't attack those people.

275
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,180
 They are stronger than we are.

276
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,580
 And they spread among the Israelites

277
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,380
 a bad report about the land they had explored.

278
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,620
 They said the land we explored devours those living in it.

279
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,780
 Not the people, but the land.

280
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,920
 It'll just swallow you alive if you go in.

281
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,980
 All the people we saw there are of great size.

282
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,860
 Or your translation may even say we're giants.

283
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,100
 We saw the Nephilim there.

284
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
 The descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim.

285
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,100
 And we seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes.

286
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,860
 And we looked the same to them.

287
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,140
 So they go, guys, trust us.

288
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,820
 We cannot do this.

289
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,660
 Don't listen to Caleb.

290
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,580
 This land is gonna kill us.

291
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,020
 The people will kill us.

292
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,020
 We've spent 40 days there.

293
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,480
 We've seen it all.

294
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,580
 We don't want to go into this land

295
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,380
 because this land is not best for us.

296
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,320
 Now my question after reading this text is this.

297
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,460
 How can 12 men all see the same thing

298
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,100
 and come to two different conclusions?

299
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,380
 10 of them see this land and they come back saying,

300
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,540
 we've got a really, really bad report.

301
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,060
 Two of them, Caleb, and we'll later see Joshua,

302
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,340
 comes back and they say,

303
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,500
 no, we've got a really, really good report.

304
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,940
 How can it be that 12 men saw the same things?

305
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,420
 They all saw the same people.

306
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,180
 They all saw the same cities.

307
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,900
 They all saw the same terrain.

308
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,580
 They all saw the same fruit.

309
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,940
 And yet they came to two very different conclusions.

310
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,460
 How is that?

311
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,820
 Well, it's 'cause they weren't looking at the same thing.

312
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,320
 You see, 10 men, all they were looking at was a problem.

313
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,700
 Two men, all they were looking at was a promise.

314
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,180
 10 men, all they were looking at was the giants in the land.

315
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,300
 Two of the men were just looking at the God

316
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
 who was overseeing this land.

317
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,460
 And here's how they came to two different conclusions.

318
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,260
 And it's the first thing we can learn tonight.

319
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,760
 Point number one, who you trust

320
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,140
 changes how you perceive your problem.

321
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,820
 Who you trust changes how you perceive your problem.

322
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,980
 And this is important for us

323
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,060
 because all of us are gonna have problems in our life.

324
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,340
 Well, like problems are inevitable.

325
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,180
 We're gonna have health problems.

326
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,180
 We're gonna have job problems.

327
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,420
 We're gonna have relationship problems.

328
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,400
 We're gonna have family problems.

329
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,820
 We're gonna have financial problems.

330
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,780
 Problems in this life are inevitable.

331
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,340
 The right perspective of those problems is not.

332
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,700
 And these 10 men came to the wrong conclusion.

333
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,220
 And I wanna show you from the text again

334
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,860
 what it looked like.

335
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,140
 At the end of their report,

336
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,140
 after they saw all these really big, bad people,

337
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,300
 they come to this conclusion.

338
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,260
 We just read this in verse 33, and they said this.

339
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,260
 We seem like grasshoppers in our own eyes

340
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,980
 and we look the same to them.

341
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,900
 So they go, in light of our problem,

342
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,180
 we seem really, really small.

343
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,800
 They're going, y'all, we stood back to back

344
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,820
 against these guys and we look like grasshoppers

345
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,660
 compared to them.

346
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,700
 They're gonna ruin us.

347
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,460
 Now, the thing is, they were actually right

348
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,420
 in assessing the difficulty.

349
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,980
 History shows that the people in the land were strong.

350
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,140
 The armies were large.

351
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,540
 The cities were fortified.

352
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,780
 Like, they technically came to the right conclusion.

353
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,540
 There was a real problem.

354
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,220
 But why did these 10 men come to a different conclusion

355
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,180
 than the other two?

356
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,060
 And it's because of this.

357
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,980
 They looked at their problem

358
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,620
 and they compared their problem to their power,

359
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,460
 while they should have compared their problem

360
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,140
 to God's power.

361
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,820
 Because this text says, in light of our problem,

362
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,700
 we seem like grasshoppers.

363
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,760
 When they should have gone, in light of my God,

364
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,340
 this problem looks like a grasshopper to him.

365
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,260
 Because you see, while we stand no chance

366
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,780
 on our own against this army,

367
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,900
 this army stands no shot against my God.

368
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,160
 And you see, they came to the wrong conclusion

369
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,500
 of this problem because they thought

370
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,940
 that this problem was their problem to solve.

371
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,740
 It was never about them.

372
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,420
 It was about someone else.

373
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,820
 And just to illustrate it another way,

374
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,300
 let's imagine if today, rather than driving up I-35,

375
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,500
 I got on a plane from Waco to Dallas.

376
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,180
 I hopped on an American Eagle flight

377
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,820
 from Waco to the DFW airport.

378
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,580
 And let's just say I got in my seat, 14B,

379
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,020
 and I settled down before the flight takes off,

380
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,660
 and I get really, really nervous.

381
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,540
 And I start going, "Oh my word.

382
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,500
 "Like, this is gonna be a nightmare.

383
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,580
 "I've never taken a single hour of pilot classes.

384
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,340
 "I didn't go to flight school.

385
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,960
 "Like, how in the world is this plane

386
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,860
 "gonna get from Waco to Dallas?"

387
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,160
 Why would that be a ridiculous thing to think?

388
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,580
 Because that wasn't my job.

389
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,900
 My job was to sit there and allow the other person,

390
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,780
 the pilots, who were there to take me

391
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,100
 from one place to the next.

392
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,340
 I didn't have to worry that I didn't have what it took

393
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,680
 because I know someone else had what it took.

394
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,620
 This is what's going on in this text.

395
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,220
 They're going, "How are we gonna get

396
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,740
 "from this place to another place?"

397
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,260
 And meanwhile, there's another guy in this story.

398
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,100
 There's another God.

399
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,460
 There's a God in this story going,

400
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,860
 "Hey, it's not about you.

401
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,700
 "It's about me.

402
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,180
 "I'm the one who promised we'd take you there."

403
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,900
 In fact, this is how this chapter starts

404
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,180
 in Numbers chapter 13.

405
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,100
 Just to show you this, it says this.

406
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,520
 The Lord said to Moses,

407
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,120
 "Send some men to explore the land of Canaan

408
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,980
 "to see if you can overtake it."

409
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,340
 And that's not what it says.

410
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,120
 It says, "Send some men to explore the land of Canaan,

411
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,620
 "which I am giving to the Israelites."

412
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,420
 He's going, "You don't need to send spies in

413
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,160
 "to determine whether or not you can do it.

414
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,220
 "You don't need to take a vote.

415
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,560
 "I've already decided what I'm gonna do.

416
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,300
 "This isn't up to you.

417
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,680
 "It's up to me."

418
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,660
 But then the spies go in and they come back

419
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,240
 and 10 of them say,

420
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,000
 "But guys, the Canaanites live there.

421
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,080
 "And the Hittites live there.

422
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,180
 "And the Jebusites live there."

423
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,180
 And God's going, "Yeah, I already told you that they did."

424
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,600
 In fact, he told them this in Exodus chapter three.

425
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,660
 Just to read it for you, this is what it says.

426
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,800
 As he's promising them the promised land, he goes,

427
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,160
 "And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery

428
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,360
 "in Egypt and into the land of the Canaanites,

429
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,060
 "Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hittites, and Jebusites,

430
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,660
 "a land flowing with milk and honey."

431
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,260
 So I think God's looking at these spies and he's going,

432
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,440
 "All you've done on this super secret mission

433
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,900
 "is figure out what I already told you."

434
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
 You came back saying,

435
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,420
 "Hey guys, it's a land flowing with milk and honey.

436
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,260
 "I already told you that."

437
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,740
 You came back saying, "The Jebusites and Hittites

438
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,940
 "and the Canaanites live there."

439
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,220
 "Yeah, I already told you that."

440
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,380
 But they also go,

441
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,000
 "But we cannot enter into this land."

442
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,500
 And God goes, "Oh, no, buddy.

443
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,460
 "I already told you that you would."

444
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,920
 And you see, here's how Caleb came to the correct conclusion.

445
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,520
 Here's how his perspective differed from the other 10.

446
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,400
 He made a decision to focus on God's promise

447
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,600
 rather than his problem.

448
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,640
 And he decided that he was gonna trust what God said

449
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,520
 rather than what he saw.

450
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
 And Caleb here goes,

451
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,920
 "Hey guys, I see the same problem that you do.

452
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,240
 "I saw the same cities, I saw the same army,

453
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,620
 "I saw the same people.

454
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,340
 "I'm not ignoring your problem.

455
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,320
 "I'm not ignoring this problem.

456
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,720
 "The only difference though between me and you is

457
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,120
 "I'm not ignoring my God.

458
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,320
 "And I just know that even though it seems like

459
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,800
 "it'd be really, really hard for us to overtake this land,

460
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,080
 "he's told us that we are going to overtake this land.

461
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,560
 "So if he said it, I'm just gonna believe it."

462
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,960
 And that's what faith is.

463
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,840
 Faith is simply believing that God is telling the truth.

464
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,480
 And that's how Caleb came to the right conclusion.

465
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,060
 So to summarize this point,

466
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,320
 there are two ways of looking at this problem.

467
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,160
 The first is we are really, really small.

468
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,700
 This enemy is really, really big,

469
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,260
 therefore we're gonna lose.

470
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,720
 The second is we are really, really small.

471
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,960
 This enemy is really, really big.

472
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,240
 Therefore, I can't wait to see what God's gonna do.

473
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,880
 Because if he said it, I'm gonna believe it.

474
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,000
 And I'm just gonna sit back, put on my seatbelt,

475
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,980
 and watch this thing take off.

476
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,360
 Because I'm trusting him, I'm not trusting me.

477
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,480
 And it's the first thing that we can learn from this point.

478
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,240
 Who you trust changes how you perceive your problem.

479
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,720
 Okay, let's flip over to chapter 14.

480
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,920
 We just finished reading chapter 13.

481
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,960
 Let's see what happens next.

482
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,660
 The people of God have just received a bad report

483
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,600
 from the majority and a good report from the minority.

484
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,400
 And let's see who they choose to listen to.

485
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,760
 It says this, chapter 14, verse one.

486
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,960
 "That night, all the members of the community

487
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,580
 "raised their voices and wept aloud.

488
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,020
 "All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron,

489
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,680
 "and the whole assembly said to them,

490
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,040
 "if only we had died in Egypt or in this wilderness.

491
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,140
 "Why is the Lord bringing us to this land

492
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,080
 "only to let us fall by the sword?"

493
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,560
 That right there is an accusation

494
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,520
 against the character of God.

495
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,560
 They're going, God wants us to die.

496
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,480
 And more than that, He wants our wives and children

497
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,360
 to be taken as plunder.

498
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,340
 "Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"

499
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,640
 And they said to each other,

500
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,480
 "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt."

501
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,640
 Then Moses and Aaron fell face down

502
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,400
 in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.

503
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,120
 Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh,

504
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,840
 who were among those who explored the land,

505
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
 tore their clothes.

506
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,720
 And in that day, this was a sign of grief and mourning.

507
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,640
 And he said to the entire Israelite assembly,

508
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,760
 "The land we passed through and explored

509
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,540
 "is exceedingly good.

510
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,720
 "If the Lord is pleased with us,

511
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,920
 "He will lead us into that land."

512
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,600
 And if you notice, the other 10's report

513
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,440
 makes no mention of God.

514
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,540
 Here they say, "No, the Lord will lead us into a land

515
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,160
 "flowing with milk and honey, and He will give it to us.

516
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,760
 "Only do not rebel against the Lord

517
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
 "and do not be afraid of the people of this land

518
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,080
 "because we will devour them."

519
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,240
 I love this next phrase.

520
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,140
 "Their protection is gone, but the Lord is with us.

521
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,600
 "Do not be afraid of them,

522
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,320
 "but the whole assembly talked about stoning them."

523
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,480
 Which that sounds extreme, but here's what's going on there.

524
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,280
 They're thinking, "Hey, we're gonna kill you guys

525
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,140
 "before you kill us.

526
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,660
 "Because Caleb and Joshua, if we listen to you,

527
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,000
 "we're gonna die.

528
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,320
 "So we're gonna put you to death

529
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,400
 "before you put us to death."

530
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
 Then this happens next.

531
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,540
 "Then the glory of the Lord appeared

532
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,700
 "at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.

533
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,640
 "And the Lord appears and is angry with the people,

534
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,880
 "and He says, 'How long until you trust me?

535
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,540
 "What else do I gotta do?'"

536
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:06,280
 In your life right now, what else does He gotta do?

537
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,760
 I mean, think about the history lesson I gave you

538
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,000
 before we jumped into this text.

539
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,440
 Think about it specifically for the Israelites.

540
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,880
 Think about what they saw God do.

541
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,040
 They were enslaved in Egypt,

542
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,640
 thought they would die in Egypt,

543
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,580
 and God brought them up out of slavery and into freedom.

544
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,080
 God did it.

545
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,040
 And then they're standing on the banks of the sea,

546
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,160
 thinking that they're gonna get overtaken again,

547
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,320
 thinking that they're gonna die,

548
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,480
 only for God to make a way,

549
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,640
 and they walk through on dry ground.

550
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,040
 God did it.

551
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,200
 And then they're in the desert,

552
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,760
 thinking that they're gonna die once again

553
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,800
 because there is no food,

554
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,720
 and then manna is provided for them every single day.

555
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,440
 God did it.

556
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,900
 And here, once again, they're going,

557
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,800
 "We don't think God will do it."

558
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,300
 And God's going, "What else do I need to do?"

559
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,600
 Friend, what else does He need to do for you,

560
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,500
 for you to trust Him?

561
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,480
 And here, this time, He says that their disbelief

562
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,420
 is deserving of punishment.

563
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,260
 And skipping ahead to verse 19,

564
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,740
 Moses goes to God and says,

565
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,180
 "In accordance with your great love,

566
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,340
 forgive the sins of these people,

567
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,660
 just as you have pardoned them

568
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,460
 from the time they left Egypt until now."

569
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,140
 And the Lord replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.

570
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,300
 Nevertheless, as surely as I live,

571
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,660
 and as surely as the glory of the Lord

572
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,880
 fills the whole earth,

573
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,740
 not one of those who saw my glory

574
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,440
 in the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness,

575
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,900
 but who disobeyed me and tested me 10 times,

576
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,140
 not one of them will ever see the land I promised

577
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,500
 on oath to their ancestors,

578
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 and no one who has treated me with contempt

579
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,440
 will ever see it."

580
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,060
 And since they disbelieved God,

581
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,300
 they were sentenced to wander in the desert for 40 years,

582
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,500
 and not a single person who disbelieved God

583
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,720
 got to see the power of God,

584
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,260
 as he could have brought them into the promised land.

585
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,100
 And this is point number two,

586
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,580
 second thing we can learn.

587
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,700
 Disbelief will make you miss out on what God can do.

588
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,980
 Disbelief will make you miss out on what God can do.

589
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,800
 You see, if they would have just believed God,

590
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,120
 they would have gotten to see God

591
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,600
 bring them into the promised land.

592
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,620
 But since they didn't,

593
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,700
 they spent the rest of their life in the desert,

594
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,300
 and they died in the desert,

595
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,420
 and their disbelief had consequences.

596
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,840
 And if we're to look at this story

597
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,820
 and learn all we possibly can about this story,

598
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,460
 and learn all we possibly can about the character and person

599
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,540
 of God, I think we can learn this from this story.

600
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,820
 And it's this, our disbelief has consequences.

601
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,960
 If we spend our life disbelieving God,

602
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,100
 there will be things in our life

603
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,100
 that we will miss out on simply because we didn't believe

604
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,580
 that they could actually happen,

605
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,640
 because our disbelief has consequences.

606
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,980
 Now, I also wanna be clear that I do not believe

607
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,900
 that every single consequence in your life

608
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,620
 is a result of disbelief.

609
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,140
 Not every pain in your life,

610
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,580
 or every challenge in your life is a result of disbelief.

611
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,980
 But I do believe that disbelief has consequences

612
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,900
 because disbelief will make you miss out

613
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,100
 on what God can do.

614
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,460
 And here, their disbelief had a consequence.

615
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,860
 And this consequence was for them

616
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,580
 to wander in the desert for 40 years.

617
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,620
 You ever wonder why?

618
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,140
 Well, like if you grew up in church,

619
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,300
 maybe you've heard this story a lot.

620
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,500
 You know, the Israelites, they were enslaved,

621
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,780
 and then they got into freedom,

622
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,340
 but then they had to wander in the desert for 40 years.

623
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,340
 Why did God make them wander in the desert for 40 years?

624
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,140
 Like, that feels like a really extreme punishment

625
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,620
 based on this scenario.

626
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,180
 Why did God say, okay, you're going to have to wander

627
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,580
 in the desert for 40 years?

628
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,300
 Here's why.

629
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,860
 It's because they asked for it.

630
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,020
 This is what they wanted.

631
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,060
 And in fact, this is what we actually just read in the text.

632
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,340
 Let's read it again.

633
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,460
 Look at what the Israelites said to God.

634
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,540
 They said, "All the Israelites grumbled

635
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,720
 "against Moses and Aaron,

636
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,540
 "and the whole assembly said to them,

637
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,460
 "if only we had died in Egypt or in this wilderness."

638
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,420
 So God's going, I want to lead you into a promised land.

639
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,140
 And they go, we don't want to go into the promised land.

640
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,820
 We either want to die in Egypt or we want to die here.

641
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,100
 And God's going, well,

642
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,620
 you're certainly not going back to Egypt.

643
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,460
 So if you want to die here, go for it.

644
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,620
 And he just gave them what they asked for.

645
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,820
 Why did they ask for this?

646
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,460
 Like what a lame request of the Lord.

647
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,700
 Why did they ask for the wilderness?

648
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,620
 Here's why they asked for the wilderness.

649
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
 Because the wilderness was safe.

650
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,420
 This is what they knew.

651
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,700
 And what they knew was good enough.

652
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,460
 Ports, I don't know about you.

653
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,780
 I don't think we serve a God of the good enough.

654
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,300
 I think we serve a God who's able to abundantly more

655
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,060
 than all we ask or imagine.

656
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,860
 So we don't need to go, God just keep me safe

657
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,180
 because he can do still more.

658
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:52,500
 And I want to show you two things

659
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,860
 that are really, really important here.

660
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,260
 And two implications for this on your life.

661
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,940
 See, not only did these 10 men, these 10 spies

662
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,500
 miss out on what God could do through their life.

663
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,380
 They caused many, many, many, many others

664
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,180
 to miss out on what God could do in their life as well.

665
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,180
 You see, these 10 men came back with a report of disbelief

666
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,260
 and this disbelief was contagious

667
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,700
 and it got on the people of God.

668
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,140
 And as they received this disbelief from these 10 men,

669
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,980
 it caused them to miss out on what God could do

670
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,700
 in and through their life.

671
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,780
 And that right there has two implications in your life.

672
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,380
 The first of this, who you hang out with really matters.

673
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,780
 Who you hang out with really matters

674
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,980
 because what they either believe or disbelieve about God

675
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,380
 is likely getting off on you

676
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,500
 because belief or disbelief is contagious.

677
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,780
 So think about the people in your life.

678
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,340
 Like are the people in your life the 10 or the two?

679
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,340
 Are they the people in your life who are coming back

680
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,100
 saying God can't do it?

681
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,100
 It's too big, it's too challenging.

682
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,580
 Oh, you're always gonna struggle with that.

683
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,060
 Oh, that's never gonna change.

684
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,220
 Or are the people in your life the two going,

685
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,740
 hey, God can do it.

686
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,340
 He said he would and if he said he would,

687
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,180
 then I believe he can.

688
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,900
 Of course God would.

689
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
 Are the people in your life the 10 or the two?

690
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,540
 Are they the disbelieving, critical, cynical people?

691
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,660
 And if they are, I just want you to know

692
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,180
 that they are likely causing you to miss out

693
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,140
 on what God can do in and through your life.

694
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,340
 And if that's cool with you, keep hanging out with the 10.

695
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,700
 But for me, I wanna be found with the two

696
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,060
 because I wanna see all that God can do

697
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,540
 in and through my life.

698
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,780
 So the first is this, who you hang out with really matters.

699
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,900
 The second is this,

700
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,180
 you're not just receiving belief or disbelief,

701
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,980
 but you are giving belief or disbelief.

702
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,040
 So as I was writing this message,

703
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,660
 I was thinking about a specific moment

704
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,820
 that happens in our house every single day.

705
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,340
 I'm married and I've got two girls.

706
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,340
 They're three years old and eight months old.

707
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,100
 And every single day in our house,

708
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
 I was gonna say we make dinner.

709
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,860
 I have never made dinner.

710
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,780
 (laughing)

711
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,360
 It's just how it works.

712
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,540
 My wife is amazing at this.

713
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,060
 She makes dinner and then we sit down at the dinner table.

714
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,540
 And then what happens every single time

715
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,180
 is I pray over our family and over the meal.

716
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,860
 And when something happens at the same spot

717
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,700
 every single day, it could just get really,

718
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,540
 really repetitive.

719
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,540
 And I've just found myself praying something like this.

720
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,780
 God, thank you so much for this day.

721
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,660
 God, thank you so much for this food you provide.

722
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,380
 And I just pray you keep us safe.

723
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,980
 It's in Jesus name I pray, amen.

724
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,780
 And as I was looking at this text

725
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,780
 and I was looking at my life, I was like,

726
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,620
 oh, I look like the Israelites.

727
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,620
 And oh, I don't want my little girls

728
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,020
 to look like the Israelites.

729
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,580
 I was just thinking about what I've been passing on

730
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,080
 to my two little girls.

731
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,760
 And I do not want their faith in God to be,

732
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,400
 God, would you just keep us safe?

733
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,640
 Would you just keep us right here in what we know?

734
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,000
 We're thankful for what we have

735
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 and would you just allow us to keep what we have

736
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,800
 and God, just keep us right here in what we know.

737
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,920
 Would you keep us safe?

738
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,800
 I don't want my girls to believe that about God.

739
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,240
 I don't want my girls to pray that to God.

740
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,000
 But think about you.

741
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,440
 Think about when you get around the people in your life.

742
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,960
 When you get around the community group

743
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,000
 or the people that you drove here with.

744
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,800
 Like when you're with your friends,

745
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,280
 what do they hear you say about God

746
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,400
 and what do they hear you say when you talk to God?

747
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,760
 Like, let's just picture this.

748
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,120
 Let's picture that you and your community group

749
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,480
 are sitting down for dinner and you're chosen to pray.

750
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,320
 Do your prayers sound like,

751
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,480
 God, thank you so much for today.

752
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,120
 And God, thank you, man, for these people.

753
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,960
 And thank you for this meal.

754
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,320
 Would you bless this food to our bodies

755
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,200
 and keep us safe, Lord.

756
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,800
 In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

757
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,880
 Or do you sit down around that table to pray

758
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,920
 with your community group and do you go,

759
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,720
 Father, I pray that you'd save every single young adult

760
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,360
 in Dallas, Texas through the people at this table.

761
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,560
 Would sin be far from us?

762
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,920
 Father, may we never watch pornography,

763
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,520
 not just this week, but never again in our life.

764
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,160
 May we never struggle with materialism ever again

765
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,000
 in our life.

766
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 May our struggle with body image be gone.

767
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,440
 And may my friend who has a strange relationship

768
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,760
 with his dad, may that be reunited tonight.

769
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,120
 And God, may you kick Satan in the teeth

770
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,600
 through this community group.

771
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,040
 And may you be on the move in Dallas through us.

772
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,280
 In Jesus' name, amen.

773
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,000
 I tell you what, that prayer sounds a whole lot different

774
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,840
 than this prayer.

775
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,500
 My question is, which prayer are you praying and why?

776
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,780
 What do you believe about your God?

777
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,580
 Because I think your prayers say a lot

778
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,180
 about what you believe about God.

779
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,040
 And one is a defensive prayer, Lord, just keep me safe.

780
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,620
 One is an offensive prayer, Lord, let's go.

781
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,300
 Let's storm the gates of hell

782
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,380
 and let's see lost people be found.

783
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,820
 Let's see dead people come to life.

784
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,440
 And let's see sin not reign because the spirit does.

785
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,180
 So my question is, what are you giving

786
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,260
 to the people in your life?

787
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:26,060
 Are you giving off faith or are you giving off fear?

788
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,800
 If it's fear, stop it.

789
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,880
 By God's grace and God's power, stop it.

790
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,180
 Let's pray bigger things because we got a bigger God.

791
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,260
 So point number two, second thing that we can learn

792
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,460
 from this passage is this, disbelief will make you miss out

793
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,480
 on what God can do.

794
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,580
 I wanna finish this passage by rereading verse 23

795
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,820
 and then we're gonna read verse 24.

796
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,940
 God says this about the people who didn't trust him.

797
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,100
 Verse 23, "Not one of them will ever see the land

798
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,600
 "I promised on oath to their ancestors.

799
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,420
 "And no one who has treated me with contempt

800
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,360
 "will ever see it.

801
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,680
 "But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit

802
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,720
 "and follows me wholeheartedly,

803
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,440
 "I will bring him into the land he went to

804
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,220
 "and his descendants will inherit it.

805
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,580
 "And you see, since he had a different spirit,

806
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,820
 "he had a different experience.

807
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,580
 "And since he had a different belief,

808
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,540
 "he had a different life."

809
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,460
 And this is point number three,

810
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,860
 third thing we can learn from this text,

811
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,580
 a different spirit brings different results.

812
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,020
 And poor child, I just want you to know,

813
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,860
 in fact, you probably already know this.

814
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,460
 Most people will complain.

815
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,400
 Most people will grumble.

816
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,380
 Most people will disbelieve.

817
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,500
 Most people will just wanna stay safe.

818
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,460
 And most people will miss out on what God can do

819
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,120
 through their life.

820
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,780
 I don't know about you, porch.

821
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,360
 I don't wanna be most people.

822
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,560
 I want to be filled with a different spirit.

823
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,500
 I want to be filled with the Holy Spirit

824
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,860
 because I want a different experience.

825
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,260
 I want to see different things

826
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,740
 because a different spirit brings different results.

827
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,860
 And since Caleb believed God would do it,

828
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,140
 he got to see God do it

829
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,900
 because a different spirit brings different results.

830
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
 And I could give you many examples of this.

831
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,200
 Here's one that feels the most relevant to me.

832
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,940
 Some of you, in fact, maybe many of you

833
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,540
 know about something called Passion Conference.

834
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,320
 It happens every single January.

835
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,140
 And it was started by a pastor named

836
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,280
 Pastor Louis Giglio in Atlanta, Georgia.

837
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,420
 And I have a picture of, yeah, from this previous year,

838
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,980
 they met in the Atlanta Falcon Stadium,

839
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,300
 Mercedes Benz Stadium.

840
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,780
 And this is specifically for college students.

841
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,100
 And there's 65 college students

842
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,300
 from all around the country in this stadium,

843
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,460
 all to lift up the name of Jesus.

844
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,100
 And he hasn't always met here.

845
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,580
 Like it's grown year after year after year after year,

846
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,440
 and they haven't always met in the Atlanta Falcon Stadium.

847
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,580
 And one year, they did rent out the arena

848
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,260
 and a few months before,

849
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,740
 apparently like ticket sales weren't necessarily

850
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,420
 where they needed to be.

851
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,220
 Like it looked like they had bitten off a lot more

852
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,060
 than they could chew,

853
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,260
 and there was gonna be a bunch of holes in the stadium.

854
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,580
 And it just, it was incredibly disheartening

855
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,340
 for the people who were putting on the conference.

856
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,620
 And a couple of months before the conference,

857
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,780
 they got together as a team,

858
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,980
 and Pastor Louis walked into that meeting,

859
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,580
 and he said, "Guys, in two months,

860
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,520
 "whenever we walk in to the Benz,

861
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,900
 "and whenever I see every seat full,

862
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,240
 "I don't want my response to be,

863
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,200
 "I can't believe God did it.

864
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,220
 "Instead, I want to be praying right now

865
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,940
 "and believing right now,

866
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,340
 "so that when I walk into that arena two months from now,

867
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,060
 "and I see every seat full, I go,

868
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,380
 "Of course God did it, because I believed he could,

869
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,900
 "because I've been praying that he would."

870
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,520
 And friends, I've just realized in my life,

871
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,860
 there are two different types of believers in Jesus.

872
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,900
 God will provide in a miraculous way,

873
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,460
 and there is a group of Christians that will go,

874
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,020
 "I can't believe God did it."

875
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,560
 And there's another group of Christians that will go,

876
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,700
 "Of course God did it, because I believed that he would,

877
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,940
 "because I've been praying that he would.

878
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,100
 "Of course God did it, because I knew he could."

879
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,300
 Now, porch, I also want to make it clear.

880
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,140
 I'm not trying to communicate,

881
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,860
 "Hey, if you just believe God more,

882
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,860
 "you'll get all you possibly want."

883
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,820
 Like, "If you believe God more,

884
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,700
 "you'll be engaged by 10 p.m. tonight."

885
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,400
 That's not what I'm saying.

886
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,960
 Not what I'm saying.

887
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:41,660
 But what I am saying is, as followers of Jesus,

888
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,380
 we have reason for great hope.

889
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,500
 As followers of Jesus, we have reason for big belief.

890
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,620
 And let me tell you why.

891
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,220
 It's because as followers of Jesus,

892
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,660
 we have received a better report

893
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,100
 than the people of God did in Numbers chapter 13.

894
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,980
 (congregation applauding)

895
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,820
 And let me tell you what it is.

896
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,900
 Let me tell you what it is by showing you

897
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,620
 what's otherwise kind of an obscure verse.

898
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,700
 Like, in the beginning of Numbers chapter 13,

899
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,020
 it just lists out all the people who were sent in by Moses

900
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,060
 into the promised land as spies.

901
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,900
 And it lists out all the 12 tribes of Israel.

902
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,420
 And in Numbers chapter 13, it tells us who Caleb was.

903
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,420
 This is one of those verses that you typically skip over.

904
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,460
 It seems like there's not a whole lot there.

905
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,380
 There's a whole lot there.

906
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,360
 Let me read it to you.

907
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,660
 From the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh.

908
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:50,860
 From the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh.

909
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:57,460
 In Numbers chapter 13, the people of God feared death.

910
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:02,300
 So Moses picked a man from the tribe of Judah.

911
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,460
 He picked Caleb and he told Caleb,

912
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,060
 "Hey, go into the heart of enemy territory.

913
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,220
 "And your job is to go into the heart of enemy territory

914
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,880
 "and to survey these people, to survey this enemy.

915
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,420
 "And your job is to determine whether or not

916
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,900
 "we should fear this enemy.

917
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,260
 "Your job as a spy is to determine whether or not

918
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,340
 "this enemy will put us to death."

919
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,900
 So this man from the tribe of Judah, Caleb,

920
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,820
 goes into the heart of enemy territory.

921
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,420
 He surveys the land, he surveys the people,

922
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,980
 he surveys the cities, and he comes back with a report

923
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,060
 for the people of God.

924
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,420
 And he said, "We need not fear this enemy.

925
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,020
 "We need not fear death for our God will win the victory."

926
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:56,880
 A little bit later in scripture, a lot later in scripture.

927
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,940
 Once again, the people of God feared death from an enemy.

928
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,260
 This time, God, not Moses,

929
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,100
 chose a man from the tribe of Judah.

930
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,820
 And he sent him into the heart of enemy territory.

931
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,500
 Revelation calls him the lion of the tribe of Judah.

932
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,420
 You know him by the name of Jesus.

933
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,100
 And he chose this man,

934
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,140
 and he sent him into the heart of enemy territory.

935
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,860
 This time though, he wasn't sent in as a spy,

936
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,620
 but as a warrior.

937
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,180
 And he did not go in to survey our enemy,

938
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,140
 he went in to slay our enemy.

939
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,980
 And he died on the cross.

940
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,180
 Three days later, rose again,

941
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,060
 and he came back with a report for the people of God.

942
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,700
 And he said, "You need not fear death,

943
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,420
 "for death has been destroyed.

944
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,300
 "You need not fear judgment,

945
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,020
 "for your sin has been forgiven."

946
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,060
 And remember that snake back in Genesis chapter three,

947
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,340
 I just stomped on his head.

948
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,260
 And you need not fear anything,

949
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,900
 for I am alive and with you and for you.

950
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,300
 And he said, "Report, my question is,

951
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,180
 "what report are you gonna believe?

952
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,700
 "What report are you gonna trust?"

953
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,060
 You see, we as the people of God have an opportunity.

954
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,780
 In Numbers chapter 13 and 14,

955
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,900
 the people of God had an opportunity.

956
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,100
 They failed the test.

957
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,580
 May we not fail the test.

958
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,820
 You see, there's gonna be a lot of people.

959
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,860
 A lot of people are gonna say fear, panic, anxiety.

960
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,740
 We're gonna lose.

961
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:41,100
 There's gonna be people within the church that say that.

962
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,060
 You don't need to listen to that report,

963
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,460
 'cause that report is not true,

964
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,380
 because we've heard from the man from the tribe of Judah.

965
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,620
 We've heard from the lion of Judah,

966
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,540
 and he's given us a better report.

967
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,460
 The question that you have to answer tonight is,

968
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,020
 what report are you gonna believe?

969
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,540
 And who are you gonna trust?

970
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,060
 Because who you trust changes how you see your life.

971
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,780
 And I don't know about you.

972
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,020
 I just know that for me.

973
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,180
 I do not want to get to the end of my life

974
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,740
 and have it be said of me that I trust God for too little,

975
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,300
 that I ask God for too little.

976
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,180
 I would much rather get to the end of my life

977
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,500
 and meet my Savior face to face

978
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,100
 and have Jesus look at me and go,

979
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,940
 "You know, Nate,

980
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,940
 "you kinda overshot some things down there."

981
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,380
 Like, "You thought I could do more than I actually could."

982
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,260
 I would much rather lean in that direction,

983
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,100
 because I would much rather believe for things

984
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,260
 and pray for things

985
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,540
 that make me look like a fool in front of you,

986
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,420
 than believe for things and pray for things

987
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,700
 that make me look like a fool in front of Him.

988
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,060
 So what I want us to do right now, yeah,

989
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,900
 is I want us to spend time in prayer,

990
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,820
 and I want us to do two things.

991
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:06,100
 The first is, I just want us all to repent

992
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,140
 of the ways in which we have not believed God

993
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,060
 in the ways in which we should.

994
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,980
 All of us, myself included,

995
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,540
 have not believed God in the way in which we should.

996
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,580
 So let's just go to Him and repent of that.

997
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,420
 And the second thing I wanna do is,

998
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,340
 I just want us to ask God,

999
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,380
 "God, what's the one thing in my life

1000
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,580
 that seems too big,

1001
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,060
 that seems too hard,

1002
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,380
 that seems too far gone?

1003
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,780
 What's that one thing in my life

1004
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,860
 that you want me to start praying for?"

1005
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,420
 And I don't know what it is for you.

1006
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,620
 Maybe it's that your mom would be freed from alcoholism.

1007
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,780
 Maybe it's that you'd begin

1008
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,340
 to have a relationship with your dad.

1009
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,340
 Maybe it's that you'd be freed from a certain sin.

1010
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,740
 Maybe it's that God would provide financially.

1011
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,900
 And honestly, I don't even wanna keep giving options

1012
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,220
 because I would rather have the Holy Spirit

1013
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,300
 bring it to mind than have me bring it to mind.

1014
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,580
 So right now, let's go before God.

1015
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,420
 Let's do those two things.

1016
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,100
 Let's repent and then let's ask Him.

1017
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:17,420
 God, you are a holy God.

1018
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,940
 You are a big God.

1019
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,340
 You are so much bigger and so much stronger

1020
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,740
 than what we know you to be.

1021
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,740
 (gentle music)

1022
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,540
 And Father, I know that at least for me,

1023
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,620
 at least for me,

1024
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,860
 I come before you right now with a repentant heart

1025
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,060
 and a repentant spirit.

1026
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,300
 And I just wanna tell you,

1027
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,300
 God, I'm so sorry for the ways

1028
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,980
 in which I've looked like the 10 and not the two.

1029
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,660
 In the ways I've just wanted to be safe,

1030
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,100
 in the ways I've just wanted to complain,

1031
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,220
 in the ways I've just wanted to stay stagnant.

1032
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,900
 Father, I'm sorry for the ways in which I've missed it.

1033
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,740
 You know, God, we are a funny people as followers of Jesus.

1034
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,980
 We can say things like we believe Jesus conquered death,

1035
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,820
 but we don't think He can do this smaller thing.

1036
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,380
 May that be far from us.

1037
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:14,780
 And now, God, I just come before you right now

1038
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,500
 on behalf of all my friends here in this room.

1039
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,060
 And I just pray that you bring something to mind

1040
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,060
 by the power of your Holy Spirit,

1041
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,860
 that your Holy Spirit would bring something to mind.

1042
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,500
 A unique thing in every single person's life right now.

1043
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,140
 Something that seems too hard, too difficult,

1044
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,620
 too big, too impossible.

1045
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,740
 Something where it's like,

1046
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,860
 unless God moves, it can't get done.

1047
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:51,060
 Father, maybe it's something that they prayed for years ago

1048
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,780
 and stopped praying for years ago.

1049
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,500
 Maybe it's something that they've never even had

1050
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,460
 the courage to pray, or maybe it's something

1051
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,860
 that they've just thought for the first time right now.

1052
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:05,420
 God, I pray that every single one of those things

1053
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,260
 would happen tonight.

1054
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,460
 We believe you can do it.

1055
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,220
 We pray that freedom would happen tonight,

1056
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,660
 that reconciliation would happen tonight,

1057
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,940
 that salvation would happen tonight,

1058
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,260
 that provision would happen tonight.

1059
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,060
 Whatever it is, Father, we know that you can do it.

1060
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,420
 So God, we ask that you would do it now.

1061
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,500
 By the power of God, we ask that you would do it now.

1062
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:35,820
 And God, if you don't do it tonight,

1063
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,020
 may we still be found praying tomorrow,

1064
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,900
 and the next day, and the next day, and the next day.

1065
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,980
 And may we be found like beggars at your door,

1066
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,660
 knocking on your door, asking for bread.

1067
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,780
 Day after day after day, asking for you to do it.

1068
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,780
 And God, I also wanna declare

1069
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:03,220
 that even if you never do it, you've already done enough.

1070
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:07,100
 Because you sent your one and only Son

1071
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,940
 because you loved us so much,

1072
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,220
 and he lived the life we should have lived.

1073
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,380
 He died the death we should have died,

1074
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,140
 and three days later, he rose again

1075
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,940
 so that we could have life and freedom for all of eternity.

1076
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,060
 So even if you don't do another thing,

1077
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,940
 we know you've done the thing that we need.

1078
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:30,300
 And Father, we're here tonight for one reason.

1079
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,700
 We wanna worship you tonight for one reason.

1080
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,140
 We have hope tonight for one reason, and one reason only,

1081
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,180
 and it's because of the fact that Jesus is alive,

1082
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,820
 and with us, and for us.

1083
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,700
 We wanna worship him with all we've got now.

1084
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,860
 It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
