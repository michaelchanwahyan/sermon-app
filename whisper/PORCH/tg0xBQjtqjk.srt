1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,360
 - Well, what's up Porch, how we doing tonight?

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,840
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
 Hey, my name is Timothy Atik,

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,440
 and I am a teaching pastor here

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,120
 at Watermark Community Church,

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,760
 and I am so honored that I get to jump in

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,680
 and spend time with you guys tonight here at the porch.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,280
 I firmly believe that there is nothing better

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,960
 that you could be doing on a Tuesday night

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,360
 than being right here with friends worshiping Jesus.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,360
 So welcome, I'm so glad that you made it,

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,440
 and I'm glad we get some time together tonight.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,280
 Here's what I wanna ask you to do right now.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,920
 I wanna ask you to pull out your phone,

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,920
 and I wanna ask you to text a response to a number,

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,840
 and I'm gonna see your response in real time up here.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,600
 So this could go terribly wrong.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,480
 I'm just gonna acknowledge that from the beginning.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,960
 This could be the first and last time I ever do this,

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,280
 but it's worth the risk, we'll see what happens.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,400
 I just want to know, in your opinion,

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,080
 who is the GOAT?

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,880
 The greatest of all time.

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,880
 I'm not gonna put any parameters on it.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,000
 I'm not gonna tell you that we're talking about a sport,

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 or we're talking about an actor or act, no, we're not.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 In your opinion, who is the GOAT?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Text 972-497-1185, text your answer in,

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,720
 and I will see what your answers are.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,000
 You can share your answer with your neighbor, too.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,280
 All right, who you say is the GOAT?

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,200
 So I'll just read some of the responses that are coming in.

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,800
 I most certainly will not be able to share

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,800
 what you're saying, but I will read some of the responses.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,120
 I'm gonna read the first one.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,160
 The first responses that are coming in,

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,880
 I most certainly will not be able to share

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,840
 every response that has come in,

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,720
 but I'll just share some of them.

41
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,720
 Simone Biles, Michael Jordan, LeBron James,

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,800
 interesting how that works.

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,360
 Elon Musk.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,760
 My grandma, okay, that's great, good for you.

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,320
 Bieber.

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,680
 Tom Brady.

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,520
 Dirk.

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:52,320
 Phil Wickham, okay, that's great, nice.

49
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,360
 Go with the Christian answer, way to go there.

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 Michael Scott, that's valid.

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,360
 Another LeBron, another Jordan, a lot of Tom Brady.

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,360
 Patrick Mahomes.

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,120
 Anyway, Taylor Swift, of course, I was waiting for it.

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,280
 There she is.

55
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,120
 Tiger Woods made the list.

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,960
 Messi made the list.

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,240
 Okay, interesting.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,760
 Anyone else that is worth mentioning?

59
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,440
 Aaron Rodgers, okay, interesting.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,420
 Here in Dallas, okay.

61
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,640
 Nick Saban, another Michael Jordan.

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,280
 Lots of Jordans.

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
 Taylor Swift in there again.

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,280
 Okay, so that's who you might say is the GOAT.

65
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,640
 If you feel like you got left out

66
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
 because your response wasn't read,

67
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,400
 you can just take a minute, share with your neighbor,

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,280
 say, he didn't read my response,

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,880
 but the real GOAT is, just tell 'em real quick,

70
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,720
 just share it.

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,000
 Okay, great, good.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,120
 Everyone feel like you got it out of your system?

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,840
 You have had the chance to share

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,780
 who you believe is the GOAT, great, awesome.

75
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,280
 Well, the reason that I even start that way

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,040
 is here's the deal.

77
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,200
 I don't know if you know this,

78
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,280
 but Jesus Christ actually chimes in

79
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,040
 on the conversation about the GOAT.

80
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
 I don't know if you know that,

81
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,680
 but in the Bible, Jesus Christ actually weighs in

82
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,520
 on the conversation.

83
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,280
 Before we have even had the conversation

84
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,600
 about who the GOAT is,

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,720
 Jesus actually started the conversation

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,400
 and declared who he believed the GOAT actually was.

87
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,920
 Here's what he says in Matthew chapter 11, verse 11.

88
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,200
 Jesus says, "Truly I say to you,

89
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,200
 among those born of women," that's everyone,

90
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,280
 "there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist."

91
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,560
 Did you know Jesus said that?

92
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,120
 So if you grew up in the church

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,820
 and you get asked who's the GOAT,

94
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,360
 you know that the right answer to every question

95
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,260
 when you're inside the church walls is what?

96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,320
 Jesus, okay.

97
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,360
 So we would, it's important that we acknowledge

98
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
 that we believe here at Watermark Community Church

99
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,120
 that Jesus actually is the GOAT,

100
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,680
 that he is the greatest of all time.

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,920
 But it's interesting to think that the person

102
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,560
 that we believe is the GOAT actually chimed in

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,360
 and said, "In my opinion, the greatest of all time,

104
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,240
 the greatest to ever be born of a woman,

105
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,480
 which is everyone, in Jesus's opinion,

106
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,360
 is a guy named John the Baptist."

107
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,960
 And I just find that interesting,

108
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,440
 and I find that worthy of examination.

109
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,040
 Because if Jesus, the person that we might look at

110
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,200
 and say, "He's the GOAT," if he's pointing at someone

111
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,300
 saying, "You know what, he is the GOAT,"

112
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,720
 then I just think that that's important

113
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,920
 because here we have Jesus saying,

114
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,240
 "This is what a truly great life looks like."

115
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
 And so for us to look at someone that Jesus would say

116
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,320
 is living or lived a truly great life,

117
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,880
 that is something that is worthy

118
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,320
 of exploration and examination.

119
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,240
 And the reason that I think it's so important for us

120
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,160
 in a room full of young adults to do that

121
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,600
 is because I believe that every single person here

122
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,320
 is pursuing greatness.

123
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,220
 Like, nobody here is aspiring to mediocrity.

124
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,640
 Like, nobody here, if I was like scale of one to 10,

125
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,760
 like, where do you hope to land

126
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,840
 in terms of enjoyment of life?

127
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,520
 No one's like, "I'll take a four."

128
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,800
 No, like, no one wants to settle for mediocrity.

129
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,040
 No one is like, "You know what, TA,"

130
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,560
 that's what people call me, "TA, you know what?

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,880
 "My goal was to go to a mediocre college

132
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,840
 "and make mediocre grades and graduate

133
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,440
 "with a mediocre degree, and I searched

134
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,220
 "and found a mediocre job, and now I'm looking

135
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,820
 "for a mediocre spouse, and hopefully one day

136
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,120
 "we're gonna have a mediocre marriage

137
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,360
 "and a mediocre house and definitely some mediocre kids,

138
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,360
 "and I wanna grow old and be a mediocre grandparent

139
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,440
 "and have a mediocre funeral."

140
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,040
 Nobody aspires to mediocrity.

141
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,800
 Everybody wants greatness in some way.

142
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,160
 And so the question is, what does it look like

143
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,120
 to be great in the eyes of Jesus?

144
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,060
 Because what a shame it would be to be great

145
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,600
 in the eyes of man, but not great in the eyes of Jesus.

146
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,760
 When there is somebody in the scriptures

147
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,540
 that Jesus looks at and says, "Hey, if you wanna know

148
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,840
 "what a great life looks like, there it is,

149
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,500
 "John the Baptist."

150
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,560
 And so what I wanna do is I just wanna spend some time

151
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,840
 talking tonight about what true greatness looks like

152
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,320
 so that you don't spin your wheels carelessly

153
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,580
 and get to the end of your life and look back

154
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,080
 and say, "What I thought was great truly wasn't."

155
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,800
 Okay?

156
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,040
 So if you have a Bible, I want you to join me tonight

157
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,760
 in John chapter one.

158
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,640
 John, the book of John, if you're new to the Bible,

159
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,240
 it's in the second half of your Bible.

160
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,800
 Don't be afraid to use the table of contents,

161
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,600
 but it's in what's called the New Testament.

162
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
 The New Testament starts with four books

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,120
 that are known as the Gospels.

164
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,600
 There's Matthew, Mark, Luke, and then John.

165
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,120
 We are looking at the very first chapter of John.

166
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,720
 There's many different Johns in the Bible.

167
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,240
 We are talking specifically about a guy

168
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,000
 named John the Baptist.

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,360
 John the Baptist was a medical marvel

170
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,740
 because he was born to a set of parents

171
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,040
 that were way too old to have a child.

172
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,960
 Like his parents were old, wrinkly, and barren,

173
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,960
 and yet miraculously, at a really old age,

174
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,760
 his mom gets pregnant.

175
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,200
 And so he was a medical marvel

176
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,360
 and he was relatives with Jesus.

177
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,280
 And what you need to know about John the Baptist

178
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,800
 is he was super hipster.

179
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,440
 Like he lived outside of town

180
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
 doing the #vanlife thing.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,560
 He had watched some documentaries,

182
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,140
 so he didn't eat meat.

183
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,140
 He ate bugs and honey for his diet.

184
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,740
 If you don't think he was hipster,

185
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,120
 his clothes were made of camel's hair

186
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,920
 with a leather belt around his waist.

187
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
 Just wait, I promise you, camel hair,

188
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,800
 if it's not in now, wait a year.

189
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,480
 And just reference this talk and say,

190
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,720
 he called it, he was right.

191
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,720
 Camel hair, leather belt, just watch, it's coming.

192
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,880
 He took a vow to not cut his hair.

193
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,000
 He always said what he was thinking.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,140
 His life ended when he got arrested

195
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,060
 and was beheaded for calling out the Roman ruler

196
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,380
 for taking his brother's wife to be his wife.

197
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,560
 So that's who we're talking about, John the Baptist.

198
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,420
 And what you're going to see

199
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,900
 as we look at John the Baptist

200
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,780
 is we're going to see a life

201
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,780
 that Jesus considered to be great.

202
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,580
 And what I hope is clear to you tonight is this,

203
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,960
 don't miss it, all eyes on me.

204
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,960
 The greatest lives are marked by the greatest clarity.

205
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,060
 Okay, the greatest lives are marked by the greatest clarity.

206
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,300
 The greatest lives are marked by the greatest clarity.

207
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
 What do I mean by that?

208
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,740
 Well, I mean this, the greatest lives

209
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,120
 have the greatest clarity when it comes to three things.

210
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,620
 So I hope that you don't miss them tonight.

211
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,660
 Here's the first one.

212
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,780
 First, greatness requires clarity

213
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,760
 on who you are and who you aren't.

214
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
 That's where greatness has to start.

215
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,460
 Greatness has to start with you having clarity

216
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,300
 on who you are and who you aren't.

217
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,480
 Like if you were someone

218
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,020
 who is still trying to find themselves

219
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,140
 or discover yourself,

220
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,140
 right now you're not living in greatness

221
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,220
 because greatness requires clarity

222
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,260
 on who you are and who you aren't.

223
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,660
 So look with me at John chapter one

224
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,180
 and I'll show you what I'm talking about.

225
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,200
 It says this starting in verse 19.

226
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,420
 It says, and this is the testimony of John.

227
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:55,540
 When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem

228
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,340
 to ask him, who are you?

229
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,220
 He confessed and did not deny, but confessed,

230
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,100
 I'm not the Christ.

231
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,920
 Do you see it?

232
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,080
 He has clarity, I'm not the Christ.

233
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,120
 And they asked him, what then?

234
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,960
 Are you Elijah?

235
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,300
 He said, I'm not.

236
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,140
 Are you the prophet?

237
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,440
 He answered, no.

238
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,900
 So they said to him, who are you?

239
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,720
 We need to give an answer to those who sent us.

240
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,360
 What do you say about yourself?

241
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,820
 He said, I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness.

242
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,040
 Make straight the way of the Lord

243
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,400
 as the prophet Isaiah said.

244
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,000
 So all eyes on me.

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
 Let me just make sure you understand

246
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
 what is happening right now in the first century.

247
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,120
 That's where John the Baptist shows up.

248
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,580
 In the first century, it was this time

249
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,580
 where there was this growing anticipation

250
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,560
 and excitement about a coming Messiah.

251
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,280
 At this time, the Jewish people

252
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,520
 were under Roman oppression.

253
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,840
 And so the Jews believed that there would be a Messiah,

254
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
 a savior that would come

255
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,480
 and would come as a ruling and conquering king

256
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,760
 who would establish political dominion

257
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,280
 and would overthrow oppressive Rome

258
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,900
 and establish a kingdom

259
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,300
 where Israel is the ruling kingdom.

260
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,420
 And so that's what the Jews believed.

261
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,260
 And so John the Baptist shows up

262
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,860
 and Jews at the time,

263
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,820
 they're on the lookout for anyone suspicious

264
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,780
 that they might see is the Messiah.

265
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,260
 And John the Baptist shows up wearing camels hair

266
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,700
 and a leather belt, and he's not eating meat.

267
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,220
 He's eating honey and bugs.

268
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,200
 And he's living outside of town

269
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,160
 and he's baptizing people.

270
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,600
 Now, when you hear that, you might think,

271
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,640
 well, what's the big deal?

272
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,840
 Christians baptized.

273
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,560
 Well, just remember,

274
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,680
 like Jesus has not come and died on the cross yet

275
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,000
 and risen from the dead.

276
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,920
 When we baptize people now in the church,

277
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,640
 we do it for people to identify themselves

278
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,960
 with Jesus's death, burial and resurrection.

279
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,880
 So when we hear that John the Baptist is baptizing,

280
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,960
 that's not what is happening here.

281
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,960
 Baptism at this point in time was a way for Gentiles,

282
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,440
 people who weren't Jews,

283
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,960
 it was a purification ritual.

284
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,600
 They would immerse themselves in water

285
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,120
 as a symbol that they were cleansing themselves

286
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,840
 as they enter the Jewish community.

287
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,920
 And this was a ritual that was normally performed

288
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,160
 by a priest in an important place.

289
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,240
 Well, John the Baptist shows up

290
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,240
 and instead of him watching people immerse themselves,

291
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,840
 he's dunking them.

292
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,000
 And he's doing it outside of town in a river.

293
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,680
 And he's not baptizing Gentiles,

294
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,360
 he's actually baptizing Jews.

295
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,120
 So it's like John the Baptist is going to the people of God

296
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,280
 and saying, you think that you're God's people,

297
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
 but you're really not, you need to repent

298
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,620
 and I need to baptize you.

299
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,260
 And so people see that and they're like, okay.

300
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,920
 Like the equivalent of the Jewish Supreme Court

301
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,760
 gets together and they're like,

302
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,000
 "We gotta figure out who this guy is."

303
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 So they send their minions and they go to John the Baptist

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,120
 and that sets up what we just read.

305
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,360
 So they come to him

306
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,120
 and they just begin to work down their checklist.

307
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,520
 So they start and they're like, "Hey, are you the Christ?"

308
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,680
 He's like, "Nope, wrong guy."

309
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,440
 Okay, Christ, it's the Greek word Christos,

310
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,880
 it corresponds with the Hebrew word Mashiach,

311
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,920
 which means Messiah or anointed one.

312
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,040
 So they're like, "Are you the one?

313
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,800
 Are you the one that we've been waiting for?

314
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,080
 We've been anticipating

315
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,480
 and you're gonna deliver us from room."

316
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,820
 He's like, "Nope, you got the wrong guy."

317
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,880
 So they move down their list.

318
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,880
 Okay, well then you gotta be Elijah.

319
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,700
 Elijah was an important figure in the Old Testament.

320
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,240
 And people believed that,

321
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,560
 you know, Elijah didn't die in the Old Testament,

322
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,320
 he was just carried off by a fiery chariot.

323
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,400
 And if you're new to the church, you're like,

324
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,240
 "That sounds like a pretty great way to go.

325
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,400
 Like, how do you sign up for that?"

326
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,000
 But in the last book of the Old Testament,

327
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,120
 it says that Elijah would come back.

328
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,960
 So they're like, "Okay, so are you Elijah?"

329
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,920
 He's like, "Nope, not him either."

330
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,320
 They're like, "Okay, cross that name off the list.

331
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,360
 Okay, then you have to be the prophet.

332
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,600
 Okay, because Moses all the way back,

333
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,280
 at the beginning of the Old Testament,

334
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,760
 he promised that a prophet would come.

335
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,000
 And we now know that that's a reference to Jesus,

336
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,360
 but people had begun to believe

337
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,240
 that it was a special end times figure

338
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
 separate from the Messiah.

339
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,000
 They're like, "Okay, then you have to be the prophet."

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
 And John's like, "I'm not him either."

341
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,520
 Do you see it?

342
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,720
 John has clarity on who he is and who he isn't.

343
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,880
 He is, he's confident and clear.

344
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,600
 And after they work through their list,

345
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,240
 they're like, "Okay, well then you just have

346
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,840
 to tell us who you are."

347
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,040
 And I love what he says.

348
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,760
 Look back at what he says when they finally ask him.

349
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,840
 Verse 22, they said, "Who are you?

350
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,800
 We need to give an answer to those who sent us.

351
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,200
 What do you say about yourself?"

352
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,040
 What did he say?

353
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,560
 He says, "I'm the voice.

354
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,480
 I'm the voice of one crying out."

355
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,040
 So you think about a voice,

356
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,720
 a voice isn't something that you can see.

357
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,360
 It's only something that you can hear.

358
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,120
 So this is amazing because John the Baptist is so clear

359
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,320
 on who he is and who he isn't.

360
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,280
 He's saying, "Look, I'm not someone for you to look at

361
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,440
 or behold or be impressed by.

362
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
 I am someone that you should hear.

363
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,480
 And when you hear me, you should hear me pointing you

364
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,360
 to the one that you should actually fix your eyes

365
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,680
 and your hope on.

366
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,440
 I'm just the voice of one crying out in the wilderness.

367
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,360
 Make straight the way of the Lord."

368
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,400
 As the prophet Isaiah said,

369
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,240
 when kings would come to town,

370
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
 their route would be planned out

371
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,400
 and people would go before them

372
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,920
 and would clear out any debris that would get in the way

373
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,280
 of the king arriving on time.

374
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,960
 And John the Baptist just saying, "Yeah, that's me.

375
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,080
 I'm not the king.

376
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,040
 I've just come to prepare the way for the king."

377
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,920
 He's clear on who he is and who he isn't.

378
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,200
 I wanna go back to what he initially said

379
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,240
 because that's the most fascinating part for me.

380
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,080
 Verse 20, it says, "He confessed

381
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,040
 and did not deny but confessed.

382
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,200
 I am not the Christ."

383
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,160
 Talk about clarity.

384
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,280
 He says, "I am not, I'm not the Christ."

385
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,280
 So just think what was John saying

386
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,120
 when he declares he's not the Christ.

387
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,720
 There's so much packed into that.

388
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,320
 He's declaring, "I'm not God.

389
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,000
 I'm not the one who can rescue you.

390
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,880
 I'm not your long awaited king.

391
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,680
 I'm not the one that all of history has been pointing to.

392
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,800
 I'm not the one that you have been hoping for,

393
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,280
 waiting for, praying for.

394
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,360
 I don't deserve any of your worship.

395
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,960
 I can't change your life.

396
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,040
 I am just a man."

397
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,880
 That's what he's declaring when he declares,

398
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,080
 "I'm not the Christ."

399
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,200
 That phrase has become really meaningful to me.

400
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,320
 Like when I was preparing for this message,

401
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,440
 I just found myself telling myself that,

402
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,320
 "You know what? I'm not the Christ."

403
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,920
 "You know what, T.A.? You are not the Christ."

404
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,480
 And it was very freeing to just tell myself that

405
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,360
 because as I just reminded myself,

406
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,320
 "Look, I'm not the Christ.

407
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,680
 I can't change anyone's life.

408
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,720
 I'm just a guy."

409
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,160
 I got clarity on who I was and who I wasn't.

410
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,240
 And as a teaching pastor here at Watermark,

411
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,560
 this is what I do on a weekly basis.

412
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,240
 So I want you to think about what I do.

413
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,360
 I stand on a stage with spotlights on me in a microphone

414
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,360
 in front of a crowd of a few thousand people.

415
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,920
 Where else is that happening in our city and in our world?

416
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,120
 Any other time that situation is happening,

417
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,440
 it's at a concert or at some event

418
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,440
 where the person on stage is there to win fame and applause.

419
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,040
 And so if I'm not careful,

420
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:26,120
 I will make this moment all about me.

421
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,480
 And as I just meditated on the idea that I'm not the Christ,

422
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,320
 God brought clarity to who I am as someone

423
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,520
 who stands up here and teaches the Bible.

424
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,040
 I realized that all I am is a spiritual mailman.

425
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,880
 That's what I am.

426
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,080
 Like I'm a spiritual mailman.

427
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,400
 God has written a letter.

428
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,880
 This is called the Word of God.

429
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,160
 And he has written it to you and to me.

430
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,600
 And he's given me the responsibility of taking his letter

431
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,760
 and simply delivering it to you.

432
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,520
 But if I'm not careful,

433
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,840
 I will begin to care what you think

434
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,040
 about how I deliver God's mail.

435
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,360
 So I can begin to wonder, you know what?

436
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,800
 Are you gonna post about how I delivered God's mail?

437
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,040
 Like, did you think that I handed you the letter

438
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,520
 in a really like cool and attractive and funny way?

439
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,720
 But here's the thing.

440
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,720
 Like, when's the last time you got nervous

441
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,000
 or impressed by your regular mailman?

442
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,400
 Like, when was the last time that you're like,

443
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,680
 oh my gosh, it's 12.08, he's coming, all right?

444
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,360
 And so like, you're like looking out the window

445
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,640
 and you see the truck and you're like, okay, all right,

446
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,960
 this is it, he's coming.

447
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,440
 And like, when the mailman comes up,

448
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,480
 like you open the door real fast and you're like, hi.

449
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,800
 I really like how you deliver my mail.

450
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,120
 You changed my life.

451
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,480
 Can we take a picture?

452
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,280
 Like, when's the last time you took a selfie

453
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,560
 with your mailman where you're like,

454
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,040
 oh my gosh, mailman, check it.

455
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,240
 Like, when's the last time?

456
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,960
 That's not a thing.

457
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,520
 But if I'm not careful, I'm gonna begin to care

458
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,520
 what you think about how I deliver God's mail.

459
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,680
 And so it's just good for me to remember,

460
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,960
 hey, I'm not the Christ.

461
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,000
 Like, I can't change your life,

462
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,360
 but the Word of God combined with the Spirit of God

463
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,840
 absolutely can.

464
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,720
 And so, you know what?

465
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,200
 The majority of people in the room

466
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
 will never be in the scenario that I'm in

467
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,040
 in terms of this, but I just wonder what it looks like

468
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,800
 for you to just realize, gain clarity on who you are

469
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,640
 and who you aren't.

470
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,200
 Like, can we just all say at the same time

471
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
 that we're not the Christ?

472
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,120
 Would you be willing to declare that real quick?

473
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,960
 Just try it.

474
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,640
 Just say it, I'm not the Christ.

475
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,480
 Say it again.

476
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,600
 Isn't that freeing?

477
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,360
 Is there anything freeing about that?

478
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,800
 Because here's the thing.

479
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,600
 Some of you guys are living like you are the Christ.

480
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,400
 You would never say that, but you are like Spider-Man

481
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,840
 trying to hold the bridge together for your friends.

482
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,280
 Like, your friend right now who is struggling or depressed,

483
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,040
 you feel like it is on you

484
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,640
 to keep all of their life together.

485
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,560
 Or your parents are going through a divorce,

486
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,520
 or things are falling apart at work,

487
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,280
 and you feel like it is all on you and on your shoulders

488
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,960
 to hold your life and everyone else's life together.

489
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,920
 But here's the reality, you're not the Christ.

490
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,360
 You're not.

491
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,720
 That doesn't mean that you do nothing.

492
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,280
 It just means you do what you can.

493
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,760
 You do something, but you can't do everything.

494
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,800
 Or you know what?

495
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,800
 Like, you look on social media,

496
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,520
 and then you drown in insecurity

497
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,240
 because you constantly feel like you're failing

498
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,560
 because social media tells you

499
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,400
 that you're supposed to be a Christ.

500
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,920
 Like, you're supposed to just always be amazing.

501
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,080
 You need to look amazing.

502
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,080
 You need to have an amazing figure.

503
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,040
 You need to be a perfect friend.

504
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,640
 You need to work 80 hours a week,

505
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,280
 but then you need to still at the same time

506
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,520
 always have time for amazing experiences

507
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,960
 with amazing friends, having amazing drinks

508
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,680
 at amazing places, and you need to take amazing pictures,

509
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,960
 and then you need to do amazing work at church,

510
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,640
 and everything has to be amazing.

511
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,760
 And the reality is you can't always

512
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,960
 and everything be amazing,

513
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,520
 'cause you're not the Christ.

514
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,120
 And so what if you just,

515
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,960
 could you just allow the freedom

516
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,040
 to come of taking that weight off of your shoulders

517
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,640
 and putting it back on Jesus?

518
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,400
 Because His shoulders are strong enough to carry it.

519
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,360
 And so I tell you that just to say,

520
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,120
 like, are you clear?

521
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,160
 Because greatness requires clarity

522
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,680
 on who you are and who you aren't, okay?

523
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,080
 Second, greatness requires clarity

524
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,640
 on who Jesus is and who He isn't.

525
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,480
 The greatest lives have the greatest clarity.

526
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,920
 Greatness requires clarity on who Jesus is and who He isn't.

527
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,240
 Look back at the text, John chapter one.

528
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,040
 Look at what it says in verse 24.

529
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,000
 It says, "Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.

530
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,560
 "They asked Him, 'Then why are you baptizing?

531
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,960
 "'If you're neither the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet,

532
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,800
 "'John answered them, 'I baptize with water,

533
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,000
 "'but among you stands one you do not know,

534
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,680
 "'even he who comes after me.'"

535
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,360
 That's important.

536
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,120
 "Even he who comes after me,

537
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,120
 "the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."

538
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,360
 These things took place in Bethany,

539
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,440
 across the Jordan where John was baptizing.

540
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
 Did you see what he said?

541
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,320
 He says, "There's one that comes after me."

542
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,560
 The reason that that statement is important

543
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,480
 was because in the first century,

544
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,880
 there was a superficial belief

545
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,520
 that if you were older than someone,

546
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,120
 then you were more worthy of honor.

547
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,920
 But John was technically older than Jesus.

548
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,280
 And John's point is, "Jesus might've showed up after me,

549
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,520
 "but make no mistake, I'm not even worthy

550
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,680
 "to perform the task that was reserved for a slave.

551
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,240
 "I'm not even worthy of that."

552
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,240
 See, Jesus's identity bred humility in John the Baptist.

553
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,680
 See, when you realize who Jesus is,

554
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,560
 it reminds you who you're not.

555
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,560
 And Jesus's identity breeds humility in you and in me.

556
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,360
 Do you have that type of clarity on who he is?

557
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,240
 John's saying, "He came after me, but he ranks before me."

558
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,040
 Colossians 1, verse 18, it says this about Jesus.

559
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,760
 It says, "He's the head of the body, the church.

560
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,040
 "He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead."

561
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,640
 Watch this, "That in everything, he might be preeminent."

562
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,240
 Do you know what that word preeminent means?

563
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,800
 It means first place.

564
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,680
 It means that Jesus Christ takes first place.

565
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,880
 Sometimes we wanna act like Jesus is significant,

566
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,040
 but not preeminent.

567
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,160
 He's significant.

568
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,000
 You know what?

569
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,320
 He's a part of my life.

570
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,360
 Like I've got a lot going on in my life right now,

571
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,640
 but he's still significant enough for me

572
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,760
 to carve out time on a Tuesday night

573
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,000
 for me to show up to the porch.

574
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,200
 No, Jesus isn't just significant, he's preeminent.

575
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,360
 First place.

576
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,440
 So that's clarity on who he is and who he isn't.

577
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,760
 John goes on in verse 29, he says,

578
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
 it says, "The next day, he, John the Baptist,

579
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,640
 "saw Jesus coming toward him and said,

580
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,600
 "'Behold, the Lamb of God,

581
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,520
 "'who takes away the sin of the world.

582
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,840
 "'This is he of whom I said,

583
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,000
 "'after me comes a man who ranks before me,

584
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,560
 "'because he was before me.'"

585
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,600
 John the Baptist says, "You wanna know who Jesus is?

586
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,240
 "He's the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."

587
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,720
 If you're new to the Bible,

588
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,160
 that idea of Jesus being the Lamb of God,

589
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,720
 it's a reference to the Old Testament.

590
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,120
 If you're familiar with the story of the Exodus,

591
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,800
 where the nation of Israel was in captivity to Egypt,

592
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,760
 and then God sent Moses in to rescue them out,

593
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,520
 right before they left Egypt,

594
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,560
 they celebrated what was known as the Passover,

595
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,520
 where God gave the command to slaughter a lamb

596
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,040
 and to take the blood and to paint it

597
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,600
 on the doorpost of their homes,

598
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,080
 so that when the angel of death swept through the land,

599
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,960
 the angel of death would pass over

600
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,040
 the homes of the Israelites.

601
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,560
 And John the Baptist looks and says,

602
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,360
 "Jesus is our Passover lamb."

603
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,760
 See, Jesus is the lamb that would be slaughtered

604
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,600
 for you and me.

605
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,840
 See, when Jesus Christ hung on a cross,

606
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,520
 that's what was happening.

607
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,640
 His blood was being shed for you and for me.

608
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,560
 And when you put your faith in Jesus Christ,

609
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,160
 like when you surrender your life,

610
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,320
 when you give your life to Jesus,

611
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,480
 you know what you're doing?

612
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,400
 You're painting the blood of Jesus Christ

613
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,240
 on the doorposts of your heart.

614
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,600
 So God's wrath now passes over you.

615
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,120
 And you no longer come into his judgment,

616
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,520
 you can be received into his love,

617
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,800
 his acceptance and his approval.

618
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,240
 You actually are invited into his family.

619
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,480
 Why?

620
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,880
 Because you know Jesus Christ, the Passover lamb.

621
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,600
 If you flip over real quick to John chapter three,

622
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,160
 I'll show you one more thing about Jesus.

623
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,360
 John chapter three, this is John the Baptist talking again.

624
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,440
 John the Baptist says this in verse 30, he says,

625
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,600
 "He," that's Jesus, "must increase, but I must decrease."

626
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,200
 Put that on a note on your mirror.

627
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
 Read that each day in the morning.

628
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,360
 He must increase, but I must decrease.

629
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,680
 He says this, verse 31,

630
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,680
 "He," that's Jesus, "who comes from above is above all.

631
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,480
 "He who is of the earth belongs to the earth

632
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,400
 "and speaks in an earthly way.

633
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,400
 "He who comes from heaven is above all."

634
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,880
 Do you see that?

635
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,600
 Jesus is not like us.

636
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,360
 He came from heaven.

637
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,480
 We started here on earth and we're aiming to get to heaven.

638
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,160
 Jesus had always been in heaven and came to earth

639
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,280
 to rescue us, to take us to where he is.

640
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,760
 Verse 32, "He bears witness to what he has seen and heard.

641
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,880
 "Yet no one receives his testimony.

642
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,760
 "Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this,

643
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,240
 "to this that God is true.

644
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,640
 "For he whom God has sent utters the words of God,

645
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,320
 "for he gives the spirit without measure."

646
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,520
 Watch this, "The father loves the son," that's Jesus,

647
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,120
 "and has given all things into his hands.

648
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,800
 "Whoever believes in the son has eternal life.

649
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,960
 "Whoever does not obey the son shall not see life,

650
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,880
 "but the wrath of God remains on him."

651
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,640
 Do you have clarity on who Jesus is and who he isn't?

652
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,760
 He's preeminent.

653
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,120
 He's the lamb of God.

654
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,000
 And he is the one and only one

655
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,200
 who can give you eternal life.

656
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,040
 That's who he is.

657
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,920
 Do you have that type of clarity?

658
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,720
 I wanna speak for a moment to those in the room

659
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,920
 who have been, if you've been a Christian for a while,

660
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,080
 I'm especially talking to you right now

661
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,000
 because you might have just heard everything

662
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,240
 that I've said and you think to yourself,

663
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,120
 "Yeah, I have clarity on all that."

664
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,240
 Maybe your theology is intact,

665
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,280
 but your intimacy with Jesus isn't.

666
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,640
 Here's what I want you to see.

667
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,880
 Flip back over to chapter one.

668
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,160
 I wanna point something out to you.

669
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,000
 Just look real quick at verse 31.

670
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,240
 Says, "I myself did not know him,

671
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,840
 but for this purpose I came baptizing with water

672
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,960
 that he might be revealed to Israel.

673
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,720
 In John bore witness,

674
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,400
 I saw the spirit descend from heaven like a dove

675
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,440
 and it remained on him.

676
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,520
 I myself did not know him,

677
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,960
 but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me,

678
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,360
 'He on whom you," what's that next word?

679
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,920
 "See the spirit descend and remain,

680
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,800
 that this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit."

681
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,960
 Verse 34, "And I have," what?

682
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,480
 "Seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."

683
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,080
 Do you see what John the Baptist is saying?

684
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,440
 He's saying, "I've seen Jesus.

685
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,720
 I have seen, I've seen Jesus."

686
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,280
 If you've been a Christian for a while,

687
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,240
 maybe you have clarity on who he is

688
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,160
 and who he isn't theologically,

689
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,720
 but it's been a while since you've seen him

690
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,120
 and experienced him intimately.

691
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,880
 And so I tell you that just to say,

692
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
 like, I just wanna ask you,

693
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,240
 like, when's the last time that you saw Jesus?

694
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,840
 When's the last time you saw him?

695
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,360
 Jesus, when he's on a boat with some friends,

696
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,240
 he's just fed 4,000 people and he gets onto a boat

697
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,400
 and his friends start complaining

698
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,560
 that they forgot to bring bread

699
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,240
 and Jesus had just like miraculously made a bunch of bread

700
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,720
 and he's like, "Guys, do you have eyes

701
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,880
 and yet you still don't see?"

702
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,320
 So my question to you,

703
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
 if you've been a Christian for a while,

704
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,120
 is when's the last time you were captivated

705
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,320
 by the goodness of Jesus Christ?

706
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,960
 Because spiritual blindness is simply seeing Jesus

707
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,640
 without being captivated by his goodness

708
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,520
 or compelled to worship him.

709
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,360
 So when's the last time you were captivated by his goodness?

710
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,320
 Because maybe you're not living as if Jesus is preeminent

711
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,600
 because you really don't have practical clarity

712
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,520
 on who Jesus is and who he isn't.

713
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,800
 Maybe you have theological clarity,

714
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,520
 your theology is intact,

715
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,520
 but practically you don't live as if he is who he is.

716
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,160
 And it's because you haven't seen him in a while.

717
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,720
 And the reason you haven't seen him

718
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,880
 is because you haven't taken time

719
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,320
 to sit with him until you see him.

720
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,680
 Let me ask you this.

721
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:02,920
 Have you ever met anyone whose marriage story,

722
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,240
 like you sit down with them and you're like,

723
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,960
 "Hey, so tell me how you met."

724
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,800
 Have you ever met anyone whose story was,

725
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,720
 "Well, you know what?

726
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,040
 We said hi to each other every Monday, Wednesday,

727
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,160
 and Friday on campus.

728
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,680
 Like we passed each other.

729
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,200
 We said hi and we've been married for 30 plus years."

730
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,200
 That's not a story.

731
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,680
 Because you don't fall in love

732
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,760
 by just glancing at someone.

733
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,520
 You fall in love by gazing at someone.

734
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,480
 So like you take someone out.

735
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,400
 Some people are like, "Hey man, like let's talk about that.

736
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,200
 This isn't a dating talk.

737
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,520
 Ask someone out there.

738
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,360
 That's it.

739
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,600
 That's the dating portion of this talk."

740
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,080
 But you sit down with someone

741
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,400
 and you look at them with your eyes

742
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,320
 and you ask them questions to learn about who they are.

743
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,640
 And then you begin to see them.

744
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,520
 Like I used to work with college students.

745
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,960
 And so some of y'all were college students once.

746
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
 So maybe you worked at a camp.

747
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,160
 Anyone ever work at a camp?

748
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,000
 Maybe not many people.

749
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,520
 Some of you guys, you know.

750
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,080
 So there's camp romance.

751
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,280
 You know, you show up to camp

752
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,600
 and like, and something happens.

753
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,960
 Like you see a girl on the first day

754
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,440
 and you don't really think much of it.

755
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,600
 But then like you watch how she drinks

756
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,960
 from her Nalgene bottle

757
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,080
 and you watch how she wears her Chacos

758
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,120
 and how she strings up her hammock.

759
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,800
 And like by the end of camp,

760
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,000
 you have seen her.

761
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,040
 That's what I'm talking about.

762
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,240
 I'm talking about gazing at Jesus until you see him

763
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,320
 and you're captivated by his beauty.

764
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,800
 See, we live in a world that wants to convince you

765
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,400
 that you can just live off of glances.

766
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,880
 And so the Christian world is trying to like shorten

767
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,720
 and expedite your time with Jesus.

768
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,560
 It's like, you know what?

769
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,440
 We've got apps for that.

770
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,560
 And like for just three minutes a day,

771
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,920
 here's this quick devotional.

772
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,440
 You just click play and you know what?

773
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,000
 You can do a double speed.

774
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,120
 So you talk really fast

775
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,800
 and you can just get it done.

776
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,000
 But Jesus loves you too much to give you all of himself

777
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,840
 in three minutes.

778
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,360
 And yet you're like, I don't know why.

779
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,160
 I just feel so spiritually dry.

780
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,800
 I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

781
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,000
 Let me, no date with my wife has ever gone well

782
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,040
 for just three minutes.

783
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,600
 It's like, okay, let's just get this done.

784
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,160
 Okay, like here's what we're gonna order

785
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,600
 and let's just eat real fast.

786
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,160
 And let's just, fill me in like that.

787
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,520
 Oh, like that type of efficiency.

788
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,400
 It doesn't manufacture intimacy.

789
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,520
 Efficiency is the enemy of intimacy when it comes to Jesus.

790
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,160
 And so I tell you that,

791
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,400
 I tell you that because the joy

792
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,840
 is found in sitting with him until you see him.

793
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,680
 Because when you gaze at him,

794
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,120
 you begin to taste and see that he's good.

795
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,840
 And so I tell you that because true greatness,

796
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:23,520
 greatness requires clarity on who Jesus is and who he isn't.

797
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,880
 And some of you need to get where you can see him

798
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,200
 so that you can get clear again on who he truly is.

799
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,680
 Finally, greatness requires clarity

800
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,320
 on what you were put on earth to do.

801
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,440
 Are you clear on that?

802
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,600
 Are you clear on what you were put on earth to do?

803
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,440
 I mean, that's probably a pretty big question

804
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,960
 for people in this life stage to be figuring out.

805
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,720
 Like God, what did you put me on earth to do?

806
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,240
 Greatness requires clarity

807
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,000
 on what you were put on earth to do.

808
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,840
 Look back, John chapter one.

809
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,640
 Let me just show you a few things real quick.

810
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,840
 Verse 29.

811
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,280
 Again, it says this,

812
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,720
 "The next day he, John the Baptist, saw Jesus

813
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,680
 coming toward him, and what did he say?

814
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,200
 'Behold, the Lamb of God,

815
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,360
 who takes away the sin of the world.'"

816
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,480
 Skip down to verse 34.

817
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,160
 "I have seen and bore witness that this is the Son of God."

818
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,600
 Verse 35, "The next day again,

819
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,360
 John was standing with two of his disciples,

820
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,560
 and he looked at Jesus as he walked by,

821
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,520
 and said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God.'"

822
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,200
 The two disciples heard him saying this,

823
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,040
 and what did they do?

824
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,400
 They followed Jesus.

825
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,840
 So here's what I want you to see, okay?

826
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,000
 John the Baptist saw Jesus,

827
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,600
 and because he saw Jesus,

828
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,160
 he wanted other people to see Jesus.

829
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,000
 He sees Jesus, and what does he say to his disciples?

830
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,720
 "Behold, the Lamb of God."

831
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,320
 And what do his disciples,

832
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,960
 the people that are following him, what do they do?

833
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,400
 They stop following him and start following Jesus.

834
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,400
 How backwards does that sound to us in 2022?

835
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,320
 Because 2022 is all about gaining followers,

836
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,880
 not losing followers.

837
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,920
 But John the Baptist didn't need to keep people.

838
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,960
 He was great at releasing people

839
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,520
 so that they could see what he had seen.

840
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,200
 And so I tell you that just to say,

841
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,160
 you know what, until you see Jesus,

842
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,400
 you are going to live to be seen like Jesus.

843
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,480
 Do you understand what I'm saying?

844
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,760
 Until you see Jesus,

845
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,080
 you're going to live to be seen like Jesus.

846
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,040
 You're gonna want people to see you,

847
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,160
 that you're gonna want them to consider you

848
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,720
 someone who influences them as an influencer.

849
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,880
 You're gonna want people to respect you

850
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,600
 and want to be around you and want to follow you

851
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,960
 and think that everything about you is amazing.

852
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,280
 Until you see Jesus,

853
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,640
 you're going to live to be seen like Jesus.

854
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,080
 But when you see Jesus,

855
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,320
 you will want others to see Jesus.

856
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,520
 Several years ago, I developed this interest

857
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,040
 in the Tour de France, which is a famous bike race.

858
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,960
 I would imagine the majority of people in here

859
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,040
 are like, what is that?

860
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,880
 Like, bike races aren't your thing.

861
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,480
 And I wouldn't say they're my thing.

862
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,120
 I'm just saying that I've developed an interest

863
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,320
 in the Tour de France.

864
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,320
 And the Tour de France is this couple thousand long mile

865
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,480
 bike race through France.

866
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,040
 And it spans over 20 days.

867
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,040
 And it's teams competing against other teams.

868
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,560
 Like you can't win the Tour de France

869
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,680
 without a team.

870
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,640
 So teams will choose a leader.

871
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,320
 They will choose a leader for their team.

872
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,080
 And then the other team members will ride

873
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,400
 for that leader to win.

874
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,760
 And there's this terminology in bicycle racing.

875
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,680
 It's a French word known as the domestique.

876
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,520
 The domestique is the person who sacrifices their race

877
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
 for the race of the leader.

878
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,200
 So like if the leader on their team gets a flat tire,

879
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,600
 the domestique will ride up, will stop,

880
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,360
 give them their bike so that the leader can keep going.

881
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,760
 And then the domestique will stay there with that bike

882
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,880
 and fix the tire.

883
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,920
 Like if the leader is thirsty and doesn't have

884
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,080
 any more water, the domestique will slow down

885
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,000
 and go to their team's car and then pedal back up

886
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,040
 to the leader, give them some water.

887
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,400
 If they're riding and win, the domestique will stop,

888
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,680
 will get in front of the leader so that the leader

889
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,640
 can draft off of them.

890
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,960
 That person, the domestique, rides for someone else to win.

891
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,720
 But it's interesting, years ago,

892
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,120
 back before Lance Armstrong was busted for doping,

893
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:20,120
 there was this moment where Lance Armstrong was riding

894
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,280
 for Team Astana.

895
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,400
 And there was also a guy on Team Astana

896
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,720
 named Alberto Contador.

897
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,280
 And both Lance Armstrong and Alberto Contador

898
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,400
 believed that they should be the appointed leader.

899
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,600
 And so there were these commercials that would come out

900
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,600
 and it was like, Armstrong, Contador, who's it gonna be?

901
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,400
 Who should be the leader of Team Astana?

902
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,440
 And it was like this competition, like, you know what?

903
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,560
 It's unsure who should ride for who.

904
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,880
 See, clarity on what you were put on earth to do

905
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,000
 comes with deciding who's gonna ride for who.

906
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,080
 You're either going to believe that you exist for God

907
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,960
 or God exists for you.

908
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,920
 And so, stepping into the point and purpose of your life

909
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,120
 is you stepping into a place where you say,

910
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,720
 Jesus Christ, you are the leader

911
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,200
 and I exist to ride for you.

912
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,480
 And Jesus, you already have won.

913
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,120
 You have already beat sin.

914
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,920
 You have already beat death.

915
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,920
 And yet I ride so that the world may know your victory.

916
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,680
 That this world may know that you, Jesus,

917
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,520
 have conquered sin and death to make us right with God.

918
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,320
 That's why you exist.

919
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,680
 I don't know if you've come to that realization yet,

920
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,680
 but you exist to know Jesus Christ and make him known.

921
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,600
 Francis Chan says this,

922
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,560
 the point of your life is to point to him.

923
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,920
 Whatever you are doing, God wants to be glorified

924
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,080
 because this whole thing is his.

925
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,440
 It's his movie, his world, his gift.

926
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,520
 A.W. Tozer says, if my fire is not large, it is yet real.

927
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,080
 And there may be those who can light their candle

928
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,760
 at its flame.

929
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,640
 He's saying that I have a fire in my bones for Jesus

930
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,720
 and I want people to come

931
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,240
 and light their candle off of that flame.

932
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,840
 I wanna bring you back to Matthew chapter 11,

933
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,960
 where Jesus declared that John the Baptist was the goat.

934
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,720
 But what's interesting is how Jesus finishes that verse.

935
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,840
 Look back at it real quick.

936
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,880
 Jesus says, truly I say to you,

937
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,160
 among those born of women,

938
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,640
 there is arisen no one greater than John the Baptist.

939
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,280
 Watch this, yet the one who is least

940
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,760
 in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

941
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,280
 What's Jesus saying?

942
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,280
 Well, here's what he's saying.

943
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,320
 Don't miss what I'm telling you.

944
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,240
 He's saying John the Baptist was the last person

945
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,880
 to do something really significant.

946
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,400
 John the Baptist came to say, the king is coming.

947
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,880
 The king is coming.

948
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,320
 The king is coming.

949
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,200
 But now we sit on the other side of the king coming.

950
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,800
 The king has come.

951
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,600
 The king has conquered Satan, sin and death.

952
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,360
 And so while John the Baptist never got to see that,

953
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,720
 we have.

954
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,600
 And Jesus says, that's what makes you great

955
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,560
 is when you come to a place where you say,

956
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
 I've seen the king.

957
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,400
 I've seen King Jesus.

958
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,080
 And I've realized that he conquered sin for me.

959
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,760
 He got on the cross for me.

960
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,920
 He rose from the dead for me.

961
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,840
 Jesus came so that I may have life.

962
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,480
 Jesus says, that's true greatness.

963
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,440
 True greatness is found in knowing Jesus.

964
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,480
 Do you know him?

965
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,320
 If you do know him,

966
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,640
 would you realize tonight you're not the Christ,

967
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,880
 you've been made for a relationship with him?

968
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,760
 Would you get where you can see him?

969
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,240
 Would you gaze at him?

970
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,120
 And would you begin to live a life

971
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,440
 that doesn't say, look at me?

972
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,560
 Would you live a life that declares, look at him?

973
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,600
 Let's pray together.

974
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,200
 (gentle music)

975
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:46,720
 And let me just ask, if you're here tonight

976
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,680
 and you're seeing Jesus clearly for the first time,

977
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,280
 like you've just gotten clarity for the first time

978
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,840
 on who he is,

979
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:02,560
 that he is the king that was crucified,

980
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,720
 that he died for your sins,

981
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,040
 he was buried for your sins,

982
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,080
 he rose from the dead conquering your sins,

983
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,520
 that when you put your trust in him,

984
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,760
 forgiveness comes and you're made right with a perfect God.

985
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,160
 If that's you,

986
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,080
 if you wanna begin a relationship with Jesus right now,

987
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,240
 would you just in the quietness of your own heart,

988
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,560
 would you just say these words?

989
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,720
 Would you say, Jesus Christ, come into my life tonight?

990
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,280
 Just tell him, say, thank you, Jesus,

991
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,320
 that you died for me.

992
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,600
 Thank you, Jesus, that you rose from the dead for me.

993
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,360
 Would you come into my life?

994
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,000
 Would you forgive me of my sins?

995
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,360
 And would you begin to lead me in a new life

996
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:54,200
 with you as my savior and as my king?

997
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,800
 If that's you, if you just invited Christ in your life,

998
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,280
 welcome to the family of God,

999
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,560
 would you tell someone tonight

1000
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,040
 so that they can celebrate with you?

1001
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,320
 If you're here tonight and you already knew Jesus,

1002
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,600
 would you sit with him even now?

1003
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,520
 Would you gaze at him now?

1004
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:17,320
 And would you ask him to use you

1005
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,280
 to put him on display to the world around you?

1006
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,760
 Jesus, we need you and we love you.

1007
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,800
 We thank you for your love for us.

1008
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,120
 God, may we be people who are clear

1009
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,560
 on who we are and who we aren't.

1010
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,880
 May we be clear on who you are and who you aren't.

1011
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,560
 And may we be clear, Lord God,

1012
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:40,200
 may this room be 3,000 strong of people who go out

1013
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,200
 with great clarity on what they have been put on earth to do.

1014
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,160
 In Jesus' name, amen.
