[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.800]   - I wanna start just by sharing with you,
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.280]   I love coming back to the porch
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.040]   because it brings me back to Dallas and I'm from Dallas.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.440]   And so I went to high school,
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.800]   I graduated from high school just down the street
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.880]   at Highland Park High School.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.640]   Don't judge me, that's just, that's where my family lives.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.760]   So that's where I went.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.000]   But as I was preparing for tonight,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.160]   I decided to bring this newspaper, "The Bagpipe,"
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.000]   which was a Highland Park High School publication.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.240]   And it was a senior issue
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.280]   where they included the senior poll.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.200]   Your high school might've had a senior poll,
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.760]   but this is where they have a bunch of different categories
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.780]   and they rank people in the class, different things.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.920]   I just wanna share with you what I was rated.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.280]   Okay, I was rated three different things.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.080]   Okay, the first thing that I was rated
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.080]   is I took third place in the category of just plain nice.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.120]   So here's what that means.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.680]   There was two people who were nicer than me at Highland Park
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.160]   but then I was nicer than about 376 other people.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.000]   So that's a big deal, no big deal, but it's a big deal.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.040]   I also took third place in most sincere,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.840]   which means that there was people
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.400]   who didn't fake it as much as I did.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.360]   And so they took the first two spots,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.760]   but then I was more sincere than the rest of the class.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.360]   And then this one stung a little,
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.160]   but it just was the reality.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.600]   I took second place in most religious.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.860]   Like there was someone who beat me.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.300]   I'm like, how do you like me now?
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.040]   If you could just see what I'm doing now,
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   I promise you first spot would go to this guy.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.760]   Anyway, as I look back on what I was rated,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.040]   I think that it can just be summed up
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.000]   that people saw me as a good guy.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.720]   It was like, there's Timothy Atik.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.600]   He's a good guy.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.560]   Girls were like, Timothy Atik's the kind of guy
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.520]   you wanna marry, which was a subtle slap in the face
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.720]   'cause it was like, we don't want you now,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.600]   but see me in about 15 years.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.040]   But the point was like, hey, he's a good guy.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   And then I went to A&M and I think most people,
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.240]   not everyone, but most people would say,
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.720]   yeah, he was a good guy.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.560]   Like he was nice to people.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.960]   He went to church on Sundays.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.200]   Like as far as we know, Timothy Atik was a good guy.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.120]   And even now living in College Station,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.360]   like I coach my kids' soccer teams.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.720]   I send meals to people when they have a baby.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.520]   Like I think people would look and be like,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.000]   I think he's a good guy.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.120]   But here's the deal.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.260]   I don't wanna be known as just a good guy.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.640]   I wanna be known as a godly guy.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.920]   And that's what I want for you.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.400]   I don't want you to just settle for being known
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.840]   as being a good guy or girl.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.440]   I want you to know or be known as being a godly guy
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.800]   or a godly woman.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.840]   Like if you consider yourself a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   do not ever exit at just being a good guy or girl.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.800]   Here's why.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.720]   Listen to what Peter tells us in 2 Peter 1, verse 3.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   He says his, that's God's divine power,
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.200]   has given us everything we need for a godly life.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.440]   So do you hear what that's saying?
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.720]   God has given us everything that we need for a godly life.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.020]   So if God in his limitless, matchless power
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.120]   is giving us everything we need to live godly lives,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.120]   why would we ever be okay just being good or good enough
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.760]   when we can be godly?
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.460]   Let me tell you what I'm really talking about tonight.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.040]   I'm talking about moving from Jesus being a part
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.940]   of your life to being the passion of your life.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.440]   Like why would you settle for just a little flicker
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.560]   of a flame for Jesus when you can be white hot?
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.160]   That's what he desires for you.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.200]   And that's where the most joy and the most life is found.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.840]   And so here's what I'm gonna do tonight.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.100]   I'm gonna give you four keys
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.600]   to moving from good to godly.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.360]   And I'm gonna do it by stepping into the life of King David.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.820]   If you have a Bible, turn with me tonight
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.080]   to 2 Samuel chapter six.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.080]   2 Samuel chapter six is where we are going to be tonight.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.180]   2 Samuel chapter six, and if you're new to the Bible,
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.520]   then you still might be familiar with King David
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.160]   because you might have heard of the story
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.660]   of David and Goliath.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.800]   We use that as analogies for all sorts of things
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.760]   anytime the little guy is up against the big guy.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.840]   But there is so much more to the life of King David.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.880]   He was the second king ever of the nation of Israel.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.200]   The first king was a guy named Saul,
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.720]   and God saw him as a mediocre king.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.880]   And so God replaced him with David.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.400]   He dubbed David the man after my own heart.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.300]   That's who David was, is he was a man after God's own heart.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.320]   That's the type of guy that we should want to learn from
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.440]   as followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.840]   David was the best king that Israel ever saw.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.240]   He led the nation to a point
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.280]   where it was the dominating force throughout the world.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.740]   David was God's man sitting on the throne.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.280]   And we're gonna step into a story that when you hear it,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.600]   you're gonna be like, this feels super outdated.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.360]   Remember, we're looking at a story that took place
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.500]   in the ancient Near East.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.960]   But what I need you to understand is that David
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.080]   is early on in his reign in Israel.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.520]   And what he is doing just right out of the gate
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.320]   is he is showing us what he's gonna prioritize in his life,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.360]   which is good as we read it for you as a young adult
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.120]   to just evaluate, am I prioritizing
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.740]   the right things in my life?
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.260]   You might be prioritizing things to be known
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.000]   as a good guy or a good girl,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.440]   but there's a big difference between a Christian boy
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.360]   and a godly man.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.880]   Don't you want to be a godly man or a godly woman?
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.460]   Do not settle for anything less
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.960]   if you consider yourself a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.000]   And so we're gonna look at a story
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.740]   early on in David's reign.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.440]   And again, it's gonna feel very outdated,
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.440]   but I assure you this story is extremely relevant to today.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.820]   Second Samuel, chapter six, let me read you
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.540]   verses one through 11, track along with me.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.700]   It says this.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.760]   "David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel,
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.860]   "30,000, and David arose and went with all the people
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.780]   "who were with him from Baal Judah
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.200]   "to bring up from there the Ark of God,
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.280]   "which is called by the name of the Lord of hosts,
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.780]   "who sits enthroned on the cherubim.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.440]   "And they carried the Ark of God on a new cart
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.020]   "and brought it out of the house of Abinadab,
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.700]   "which was on the hill.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.560]   "In Uzzah, in Ahio, the sons of Abinadab
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.100]   "were driving the new cart with the Ark of God,
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.920]   "and Ahio went before the Ark.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.960]   "And David and all the house of Israel
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.800]   "were celebrating before the Lord
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.960]   "with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.740]   "and castanets and cymbals.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.280]   "And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon,
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.240]   "Uzzah put out his hand to the Ark of God
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.880]   "and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled,
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.540]   "and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.940]   "And God struck him down there because of his error,
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.740]   "and he died there beside the Ark of God.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.760]   "And David was angry because the Lord
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.580]   "had broken out against Uzzah.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.020]   "And that place is called Perez-Uzzah to this day.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.040]   "And David was afraid of the Lord that day,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.200]   "and he said, 'How can the Ark of the Lord come to me?'
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.000]   "So David was not willing to take the Ark of the Lord
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.020]   "into the city of David, but David took it aside
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.140]   "to the house of Obed-edom, the Gittite.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.700]   "And the Ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-edom,
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.100]   "the Gittite, three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.780]   "and all of his household."
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.020]   So I'm giving you four keys to moving from good to godly.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.620]   The first is this, prioritize God's presence.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.060]   I hope you're taking notes.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.660]   Anytime God wants to speak, you write it down.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.180]   Like, don't leave it to your mind to just remember
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.580]   that's not what your brain is for.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.600]   Write it down, okay?
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.220]   The first thing, moving from good to godly
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.060]   is prioritize God's presence.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.740]   This is a story about David moving the Ark of God.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.500]   And if you're new to the Bible and you hear the word Ark,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.860]   you might be thinking that we're talking about a boat
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.620]   because all you know about is Noah's Ark.
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.700]   We're not talking about a boat at all.
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.340]   When we talk about the Ark of God,
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.280]   another name for it in the scriptures
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.140]   is the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.340]   I don't have time to give you all the background
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.540]   of the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.020]   It was the most important piece of furniture
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.460]   in the nation of Israel.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.540]   And the reason it was so important
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.140]   is because the Ark of the Covenant,
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.700]   it was this four foot by two and a half foot wooden box
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.660]   that symbolized the presence of God.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.420]   Like, the presence of God was said to reside
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.260]   right on top of the box.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.580]   And if you're new to Christianity or the Bible,
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.380]   all of this is gonna sound very weird to you,
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.380]   but all I need you to understand
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.600]   is that the Ark of the Covenant was said to be the place
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.760]   where God's presence resided, okay?
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.520]   Now, what you need to know
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   is that David's predecessor, Saul,
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.400]   allowed the Ark of God, the Ark of the Covenant,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.180]   to remain in a place where it didn't belong.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.140]   See, the Ark of the Covenant was put in the tabernacle
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.820]   or the temple, which is the meeting place of God.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.600]   And David tells us this about his predecessor,
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.220]   1 Chronicles 13, three.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.060]   He says, "Let us bring again the Ark of our God to us,
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.820]   "for we did not seek it in the days of Saul."
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.700]   So Saul was the king that went before him.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.660]   And what's David saying?
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.940]   He's saying, "For about 20 years,
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.900]   "we didn't care about God's presence."
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.640]   Like, if the Ark of the Covenant
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.980]   is where God's presence resides,
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.020]   we didn't care about it for 20 years.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.020]   And that's gonna change with my rule.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.540]   And so right out of the gate, what David is saying is,
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.020]   "We're bringing the Ark of the Covenant back,
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.060]   "and we're putting it in the capital city.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.960]   "We're putting it where it belongs,
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.760]   "because we are going to prioritize God's presence.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.180]   "His presence will live in the midst of the people."
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.100]   And so you just think about that.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.740]   That was his priority.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.540]   He prioritized the presence of God.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.580]   If you wanna move from good to godly,
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.740]   I would encourage you to do the same thing,
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.700]   to prioritize God's presence.
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.660]   The interesting thing is that,
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.980]   if you've never heard of the Ark of the Covenant,
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.340]   there's probably a reason,
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.140]   because the Ark of the Covenant isn't important anymore.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.260]   And the reason why it isn't important
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260]   is because Jesus Christ
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.060]   has made the Ark of the Covenant irrelevant.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.580]   See, in the ancient Near East,
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.460]   one guy was able to get close to the Ark of the Covenant,
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:56.460]   once a year, to step into the presence of God.
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:00.580]   And when Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross,
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.460]   and when he rose from the dead,
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.580]   he did away with all of that,
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.220]   making a path for every single one of us
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.340]   to live in the presence of God.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.860]   And so I just tell you that today,
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.540]   you have access to the God of the universe,
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.820]   the King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.500]   Prioritize his presence.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.260]   Here's what I wanna ask you to think about.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.020]   Can you think of a time in your life,
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.980]   can you look back and be like, oh yeah, God was there?
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.780]   Like, is there a time in your past where you're like,
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.780]   you know what, at that one porch, God was there?
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.100]   Or you know what, when I went to that camp,
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.740]   or when I went to that conference,
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.140]   or when I was in that dark place in my life,
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.020]   you know what, God was there.
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.940]   Like there's different times in my life
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.140]   where I can look back and be like,
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.020]   God was absolutely there.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.100]   Like when my life hit rock bottom shortly after college,
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.220]   when I was living in sin, you know what, God was there.
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.140]   When my son went into the NICU when he was born,
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.420]   God was there.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.060]   When my wife and I lost a child to miscarriage,
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.460]   you know what, God met us there.
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.140]   There's these significant moments in my life
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.380]   that I can look back and be like, God was there.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.500]   And I would imagine that many people here
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.380]   can look back in the past and be like, yeah, God was there.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.220]   But here's what I'm afraid of.
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.700]   I'm afraid of getting to heaven and getting perspective
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.260]   and being like, oh, God was there a lot more
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.420]   than I realized.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.580]   Like, so he was there in my home office every single morning
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.180]   and he was there when I was driving to work in the morning
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.620]   and he was there when I was on the soccer field
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.260]   with my kids and he was there when I was on date
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.300]   night with my wife and he was there
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.780]   when I didn't know what to do.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.700]   And he was there when I was really stressed out
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.740]   and he was there when I was making dumb decisions.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.300]   I don't want to get perspective and be like,
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.980]   oh, God was not just there in the magnificent times
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.660]   or the monumental times, God was there in the mundane times.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.820]   So what I'm telling you when I talk about prioritizing
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.500]   God's presence is I'm talking about stopping this desire
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.580]   to get back to someplace.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.980]   Like if I could just get back to that place in my life
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.580]   where God was there in transitioning to the mindset
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.740]   of God is here.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.660]   Like to just live in that reality that when you wake up
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.060]   tomorrow morning, before you even put your feet
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:33.900]   on the ground, you know what?
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.900]   God's here in the room with me.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.060]   That God's driving with you to work.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.980]   He's sitting with you at work.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.900]   He's on the bench next to you at the gym.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.960]   He's not working out.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.220]   He doesn't need to, but he's there.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:51.380]   Can you just imagine having that type of awareness?
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.260]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.380]   I'm just telling you to wake up.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:59.420]   Like it's amazing how little babies can sleep
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.060]   through the Aggies winning in Kyle Field.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.820]   Like there's a hundred thousand people
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.980]   and you'll just see little infants sleeping.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.340]   Can you imagine all that they're missing out on?
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.300]   And I just wonder if God's like, yeah, wake up.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.840]   Like every day he's putting displays of his goodness
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.800]   and his greatness on in our lives.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.300]   He's written a word and given it to us
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.960]   so that we can actually hear from God every single day.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.760]   And I think he's just like, wake up because I'm here.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.660]   So what does it look like to prioritize God's presence?
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.320]   Let me just encourage you, meet with him every day.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.360]   Like meet with him every single day.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.400]   Don't just meet with his word, meet with him.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.900]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:53.560]   Like this book doesn't exist for completion.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.920]   It exists for connection.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.360]   So if you read it and close it
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.400]   and never answer the question,
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.600]   God, what are you saying to me?
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.840]   Then what a waste of time.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.300]   And then don't leave him there.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.440]   So many of us leave God at home
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.080]   like he's like some little puppy
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.160]   that when we walk out the door,
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   he just sits there in the window with his head tilted,
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.440]   like I'll see you when you get home.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.500]   Like, no, I think the reason that Paul says,
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.920]   pray without ceasing is because when you close your Bible
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.920]   and say amen, God's like, all right, we better get to work.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.580]   Let's go to the gym.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.960]   Like he's just going with you.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.400]   Whether you want him to or not, you can't ghost him.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.040]   Like he is with you every moment of every day.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.120]   Prioritize his presence.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.520]   Number two, you want to move from good to godly,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.880]   tremble at God's holiness.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.760]   Tremble at God's holiness.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.200]   Look back at this story.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.400]   Look at verses three and four.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.840]   Remember, this is a story about them moving the ark of God.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.960]   And it says, "And they carried the ark of God
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   "on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab,
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.880]   "which was on the hill.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.920]   "And Uzziah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab,
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.100]   "were driving the new cart with the ark of God,
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.720]   "and Ahio went before the ark."
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.720]   Now, when you hear that they had the ark on a cart
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.040]   and they were driving it, red flags should go up.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.480]   And the reason why is because God had actually given
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.400]   very specific instructions on how to move the ark.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.920]   See, the ark was a wooden box that had rings
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.640]   on all four corners, and God had told them
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.600]   to put poles through the rings,
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.760]   and it was to move on the shoulders of four men
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.880]   who were qualified to move it.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.520]   But God also said, "You do not touch the ark
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.440]   "because it is holy."
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.720]   That was his command.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.640]   He had actually commanded his people,
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.640]   "You don't touch the ark specifically because it's holy."
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.400]   And the text uses that word, it's holy.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.280]   Now, watch what happens.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.240]   Verse six, "And when they came to the threshing floor
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.460]   "of Nacon, Uzziah put out his hand to the ark of God
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.940]   "and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled,
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.560]   "and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzziah,
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.720]   "and God struck him down there because of his error,
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.800]   "and he died there beside the ark of God."
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.080]   And so they're moving the ark,
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.560]   and Uzziah sees the ark toppling over,
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.400]   and what does he do?
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.600]   He puts out a hand to catch it, and he dies.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.640]   Now, real talk.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:57.160]   When you hear that, that Uzziah puts out his hand
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:02.160]   and tries to save it, and then God kills him,
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.840]   what's your automatic thought?
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.540]   Like, what do you think about that?
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.160]   How do you feel about that?
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.320]   It seems harsh, right?
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.680]   Like God's overreacting.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.160]   Like they caught God on a bad day.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.660]   He's like, "I knew they shouldn't move the ark.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.500]   "You touched it, boom, you're done."
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.640]   But if you have the thought,
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.040]   God was too harsh,
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.120]   then that is a misinformed response,
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.280]   because the reality is not that God was too harsh.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.540]   The reality is that Uzziah was too careless,
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:44.460]   because he was dealing with a holy God.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.740]   See, if you wanna move from good to godly,
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.720]   you have to begin to get your heart and mind
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.200]   around the holiness of God.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.960]   Don't miss what I'm telling you right now.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.600]   All eyes on me.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.760]   Your view of God will determine your response to God.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.880]   Like how you know God to be
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.080]   will determine how you are with God.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.280]   Your view of God will determine your response to God.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.860]   So if you have a small view of God,
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.080]   that's why you have a small response to God.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.060]   And those people who are just on fire for Jesus,
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.400]   I promise you, it's not just 'cause they're weird.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.520]   It's because their views of Jesus are just so big
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.740]   that they don't know any other way to respond.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:32.760]   God is a holy God.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.340]   What does it mean that God is holy?
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.980]   Well, the Hebrew word for holy is the,
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.320]   it's the word kadosh.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.880]   It means awesome or singled out.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.200]   It can even mean cut off.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.260]   So when we talk about God being holy,
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.960]   we're talking about God being singled out
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.960]   or so awesome or so cut off from everyone else
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.480]   in his greatness and in his beauty and majesty.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.000]   All it means is that God is so other
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.480]   than anyone or anything else in this world.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.240]   Like we can't begin to fathom who God is
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.600]   because he is holy.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.960]   I'll explain it this way.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   Like in case you ever wondered what the executive director
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.680]   of Breakaway Ministries drives,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.640]   I drive a 2015 Hyundai Sonata.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.840]   It's what I drive.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.080]   It's a pretty sweet ride.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.520]   I'm just gonna be real.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.960]   I got like the top of the line Hyundai Sonata.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.600]   Like I spent somewhere between 20 and $30,000 on it.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   It's top of the line.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.200]   It's got a panoramic sunroof, leather seats,
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.280]   even the like seat coolers.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.160]   That's a big deal.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.120]   So top of the line.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.520]   So I want you to think about us on our best days.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.200]   Like if you lived your best day today,
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.000]   let's just equate that to being a top of the line
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.400]   Hyundai Sonata.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.240]   So if that's us, like us on our best days,
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.640]   if we're a Hyundai Sonata, then who's God?
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.700]   Well, we'd say, well, then God's a Mercedes S-Class
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.120]   starting at $100,000.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.680]   Wrong.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.600]   God's not a Mercedes S-Class.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.600]   He's the Airbus 380 private jet designed by a Saudi prince
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.660]   that has a parking space for a Rolls Royce,
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.580]   a private concert hall, and a prayer room
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.940]   that automatically turns towards Mecca
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.420]   wherever it is in the sky.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.140]   That's who God is.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.040]   You know what the interesting thing is?
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.140]   That jet never made it to production.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.940]   So you can't even get online and find images of it
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.620]   so that you can begin to get your mind around it.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.620]   Your brain doesn't have a space for that type of aircraft.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.500]   And it's the same with God.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.800]   When we say that God is holy,
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.860]   that's what we're saying, that our mental capacity
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.060]   cannot even begin to scratch the surface
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.700]   of who God truly is.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.480]   He is so other than we could ever know Him to be
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.940]   in His love and in His grace and in His mercy,
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.100]   but also in His justice and in His wrath.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.300]   God is so other than we can ever comprehend.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.420]   So when we talk about God being holy,
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:17.420]   it begins to make sense why a guy named Isaiah saw God.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:22.460]   And when he just saw God, you know what he did?
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.100]   He's like, "Oh my gosh, I am lost and I am a filthy man."
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.260]   Is there anyone in your life that when you get around them,
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.660]   you're like, "Oh my gosh, I'm lost.
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.520]   "I'm a foul mouth and I'm a filthy human being."
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.340]   No.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.780]   Or like a guy named Ezekiel.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.300]   He saw God and when he saw God, he just hit the ground.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.780]   Is there anyone in your life that like they walk in the door
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.900]   and you're just like, "Kh-kh-kh."
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.580]   Like you just collapse.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.400]   You're like, "I'm sorry, I didn't do that on purpose.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.940]   "That's just, that's what you do to me."
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.500]   Anyone like that in your life?
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.580]   Or in Revelation, John gets a vision of Jesus.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.300]   And when he does, he just collapsed.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.300]   He's like, "I'm dead, I died."
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.900]   And the angel's like, "You're not dead, get up, man."
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:14.340]   That is the natural response to a God that is holy.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.640]   So let's just be clear.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.140]   If Jesus walked through that door tonight,
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.140]   nobody here would be sitting there like,
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.740]   "That's pretty good, I guess."
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.180]   No.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.700]   Like your body would instinctively hit the ground
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.580]   because your body has been made to worship a holy God.
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.100]   Do you know him as holy?
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.100]   Holy, holy.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:46.100]   Several years ago when I was in probably
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.260]   fourth or fifth grade, I used to go each week with my dad.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.100]   What did I say?
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.260]   When I was in fourth or fifth grade,
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:02.740]   I used to go with my dad to,
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.580]   my dad would go to play racquetball with his close friend.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.420]   And so I would tag along because my dad's racquetball buddy
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.180]   would bring his son, so we'd hang out together.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.300]   And I'll never forget this one night
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.380]   where my dad had called the YMCA just down Preston Road
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.380]   and he had reserved a racquetball court.
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.340]   These two high school kids were playing on the court
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.380]   that my dad had reserved,
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.940]   and they just were playing right into my dad's time.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.140]   So my dad politely knocked on the glass,
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.220]   just told him it was time, and the high school kid
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.700]   gave my dad the middle finger.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.860]   And what that kid didn't realize is that my dad
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.100]   at the time was the chief psychologist
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.220]   of the Dallas County Juvenile Department,
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.580]   which was the place that troubled teens were taken
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.260]   when they didn't do right.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.420]   And my dad's racquetball buddy
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:54.260]   was actually a Dallas County judge and an attorney.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.940]   So when that high school kid stepped out,
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.900]   my dad very clearly and firmly informed him
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.100]   of who he had just flicked off.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:10.060]   And in that moment, fear was put into that high school kid.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:15.140]   And his buddy with him was like, "Dude, you can't do that."
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:21.300]   See, that kid did not realize that he was in the presence
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.580]   of one who commanded his respect.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.220]   And I just tell you that to say, you know what,
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.380]   sometimes we are far too casual in the presence of God.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.740]   Far too casual.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.980]   Like we love talking about the fact that God is loving
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.140]   and kind and full of grace, and He is.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:46.180]   But Jesus is more than just your buddy.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.500]   Like He's the King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.140]   And so let me just encourage you
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.140]   to tremble at His holiness.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.620]   There's times where I get up in the morning
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.340]   to meet with God, and I just kind of fly
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.420]   into my time with God, and I just start babbling in prayer.
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.820]   I'm just moving fast, and as I'm praying,
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.180]   I begin to say, I begin to pray, and I'm like,
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.380]   "And God, you are holy, holy."
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.020]   And as I'm working through three holies,
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.380]   by the time I get to the second one, I just slow down.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.460]   Because I'm reminded of who I'm meeting with.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:28.420]   And my posture moves from slouched back
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.620]   to leaning forward or bending a knee.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.780]   Because God is worthy of our worship.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:42.060]   He is worthy of everything because He is holy.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.340]   So number one, prioritize His presence.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.700]   Number two, tremble at God's holiness.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.900]   Number three, treasure God's commands.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.260]   Treasure God's commands.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:56.300]   Listen to what David says in a different account
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.100]   of the same story.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.580]   In 1 Chronicles chapter 15, verses 13 through 15,
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.820]   listen to what he says, it's very interesting.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.740]   He's talking about the time that things
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.580]   went terribly wrong with the ark.
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.300]   He says, "Because you did not carry it the first time,
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.940]   "the Lord our God broke out against us."
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.780]   Why?
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:20.780]   "Because we did not seek Him according to the rule.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.740]   "So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.180]   "to bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.860]   "And the Levites carried the ark of God
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.740]   "on their shoulders with the poles,
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.540]   "as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord."
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.580]   Do you know what David's saying?
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.420]   He's saying we were too comfortable.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:41.140]   Like God had spelled out exactly what we were to do,
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.460]   and we didn't do that.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.380]   We were far too casual.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.620]   The third key to moving from good to godly
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.580]   is simply to treasure God's commands.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.100]   And I want you to see my wording there.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.340]   I didn't say obey God's commands.
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.420]   I said treasure God's commands.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.980]   'Cause some of you just need to hear
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.060]   that when we talk about obedience to God,
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.220]   obedience to God is actually for your joy.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.940]   Like I love what Todd Wagner has said on this stage,
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.140]   and other people have said on this stage
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.500]   that God isn't trying to rip you off.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.620]   He is trying to set you free.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.980]   Would you believe that?
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:23.580]   A pastor named Charles Swindoll put it this way.
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.780]   He said, "If the Lord cared enough to write it
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.300]   "and cared enough to preserve it,
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.540]   "He cares enough about the details
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:35.460]   "to have you and me pull it off precisely His way."
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:42.780]   French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre said this.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.780]   He says, "Man is the being whose project is to be God."
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:53.060]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.380]   Man is the being whose project is to be God.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.540]   Do you know what he's saying?
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.820]   He's saying we wanna call the shots.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.500]   Like we wanna do things our way.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.060]   That's our bent.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.620]   That's your bent, that's my bent.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.580]   Is to say, you know what God, I can do it better.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.220]   Let me do it my way.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.100]   But God has given us His word so that we will know His way
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.140]   so that we can carry out His will.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.980]   You know what our tendency is?
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.260]   Our tendency is to say, God, I wanna do your will,
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.300]   but I wanna do it my way.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.060]   God, I know you've given us your word
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.660]   so that we can know your ways to carry out your will.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.620]   I do wanna carry out your will, but I wanna do it my way.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:36.540]   So I remember a friend telling me, you know what?
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.740]   My girlfriend and I, we wanna honour God
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.940]   and we wanna honour God in our relationship,
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.300]   but we have just decided we're good
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.580]   with everything above the waist.
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.420]   And you might hear that and be like,
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.660]   hey, prudes, what's up?
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.820]   Like that might be, that's like just Friday night for you.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.220]   I don't know what your thing is,
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.140]   but this isn't a dating talk right now.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.380]   I just find it interesting, His wording.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.620]   We have just decided.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.580]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.580]   We have just, it doesn't matter
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.540]   what God has spelled out for us.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.300]   We wanna honour God, but we have just decided.
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.380]   You know what the interesting thing is?
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:22.980]   Is we want God's commands to submit to our feelings.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.060]   So have you ever said something like this?
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.820]   Well, I just don't feel convicted about that.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.700]   I just don't feel convicted
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.300]   about getting wasted on the weekends.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.220]   Like I just don't feel convicted
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.540]   about hooking up with people.
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.500]   I just, I don't feel convicted
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.380]   about cutting corners at work.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.540]   Here's the problem.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:51.380]   Like God's commands don't bend to our feelings.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:56.380]   Our feelings must submit to God's commands, period.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.060]   Like if you don't feel convicted,
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.660]   that doesn't indicate a problem with God's commands.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.380]   It indicates an issue with your heart.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.540]   And so let me just encourage you.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:15.740]   Treasure God's commands.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.860]   Like obedience is actually one of the greatest displays
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:19.900]   of your love for God.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.340]   Jesus puts it this way in John 14, 15.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.300]   If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:29.220]   I want you to look back in the story.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.620]   Let me just read you verses 12 through 15.
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.100]   Listen to what it says.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.500]   It says, "And it was told King David,
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.260]   "the Lord has blessed the household of Obed-Edom
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.340]   "and all that belongs to him because of the ark of God.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.980]   "So David went and brought up the ark of God
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.260]   "from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.140]   "with rejoicing.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.620]   "And when those who bore the ark of the Lord
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.860]   "had gone six steps,
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.740]   "he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.340]   "And David danced before the Lord with all his might.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.020]   "And David was wearing a linen ephod."
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.900]   So David and all the house of Israel
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.100]   brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.500]   and with the sound of the horn.
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.900]   Do you know what we see there?
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.700]   We see obedience and joy colliding.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:23.860]   That treasuring God's commands is for your joy.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.020]   God isn't trying to rip you off.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.420]   He's trying to set you free.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.900]   A while back, I was talking with my 11-year-old Noah
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.980]   and he was telling me about a kid at school
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.020]   that was just being really mean to him.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.780]   And it was just, it was stealing my son's joy.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.620]   Like I could see bitterness taking root in his heart.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.700]   And I don't know if you've had a bout with bitterness,
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.020]   but you know what bitterness is?
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.060]   Bitterness is a weed that if you let it grow inside of you,
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.380]   it will overtake anything healthy inside of you.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.180]   And so what I told my son is I said,
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.940]   "Man, I just wanna encourage you
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.260]   "to go to that person at school and just say,
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.500]   "'Hey, is there anything that I've done
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.580]   "'to hurt you or offend you?
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.220]   "'Because if so, I wanna know about it
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.780]   "'so I can ask your forgiveness.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.700]   "'But I see the way you treat me
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.740]   "'and something is wrong and I wanna deal with it.'"
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.780]   And as I was encouraging my son, Noah,
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.020]   I just saw fear in his eyes.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.500]   Because as he listened to me,
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   I could see he didn't fully trust me.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.620]   I could see that he was believing
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.300]   that what I was telling him was out to steal from him
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.420]   and rip him off instead of set him free.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.820]   And I just wonder if so many of us read this word
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.620]   and we're like, "God, you are out to rip me off."
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.860]   And he's like, "No, I'm just trying to set you free."
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:49.460]   The final key to moving from good to godly
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.620]   is this, reject man's opposition.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.860]   Reject man's opposition.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.140]   I don't have time to read you the rest of the story.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.860]   I'll just read you verse 16.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.900]   Listen to what it says.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.380]   It says, "As the ark of the Lord
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.380]   "came into the city of David,
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:09.540]   "Makal, the daughter of Saul," that is David's wife,
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.740]   "looked out of the window and saw King David
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.340]   "leaping and dancing before the Lord
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.340]   "and she despised him in her heart."
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.740]   So his own wife, David, is coming home
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.500]   and he is rejoicing.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.540]   He's full of life and joy at moving the ark of God.
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.940]   And he comes home and his wife just lights him up.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.700]   She's embarrassed by him.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.420]   And you know what David says to her?
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:40.500]   He says, "I'll even become more undignified than that."
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.540]   And his point is, "I'm worshipping God.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.660]   "I'm not seeking the approval of other people."
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.300]   The reason that I bring this up
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.060]   is everyone's great with you being good.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.620]   Everyone is great with you being good.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.700]   People have no problem with you striving
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.700]   to be a good guy or a good girl.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:07.660]   But people aren't gonna be a fan of you being godly.
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:11.100]   Because you know what being godly does
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.900]   is it shines a light on the areas of their life
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:17.220]   where they're living in disobedience to the Lord.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:22.420]   And people today do not wanna feel convicted.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.540]   And so you know what they'll say?
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.300]   They'll say, "You're so legalistic."
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.740]   Let's just be clear on what legalism is.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.860]   Legalism is believing that if you do all the right things
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.420]   you will earn the favor of God.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:39.860]   Legalism is ratifying a certain set of traditions saying,
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.540]   "If you don't do these things,
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.500]   "you will not be in God's favor."
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   But to pursue holiness for the sake of honoring God,
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.980]   knowing that you already have His approval,
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.140]   that's not legalism.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:00.220]   That's just biblical Christianity.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.180]   And so let me just encourage you,
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:09.060]   stay the course, reject man's opposition.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.300]   What do we do with a talk like this?
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.700]   Well, let me just encourage you to do three things.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.300]   Just three practical things.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.540]   Number one, before you leave tonight,
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.460]   let me just encourage you, meet with God.
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.940]   Like if God is here, meet with Him.
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.780]   Like if we're singing a song, meet with Him.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.620]   Don't come, go to all this effort to be here
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.220]   and leave without having met with God.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.580]   And then when you get home tonight,
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.860]   let me just encourage you to share with a friend
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.740]   or if you guys go and grab something to eat after this,
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.380]   just sit and share with a friend
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:51.180]   what commands do you want to fully obey in your life
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:55.100]   in order to walk in freedom and display your love for God.
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.660]   And then let me just encourage you, every day this week,
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.980]   start every day on your knees telling God
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.900]   that He is holy, holy, holy.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.180]   And then I'll end just by sharing this.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.020]   If you're here tonight
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.860]   and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.980]   you might be sitting there saying,
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.540]   you know what, I'm actually good with just being good.
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:20.500]   Like I'm good with being good.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.100]   I just want to share with you the words of Jesus
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.740]   from Mark chapter 10, verse 18.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:30.780]   Jesus said to someone, "Why do you call me good?
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.420]   No one is good except God alone."
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.340]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.460]   No one is good except God alone.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.780]   Do you know what that means?
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.740]   It means our definition of good
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.100]   is not God's definition of good.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.180]   God's definition of good is perfection.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.780]   Do you know what that means?
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.580]   Us being good without Jesus is not an option.
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:59.460]   Us just being good enough is not an option.
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.740]   And that's okay.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.260]   Because the good news of Christianity
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.180]   is that when we could never be good enough,
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.780]   Jesus Christ left heaven and came to earth
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.740]   to be good enough in our place.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.940]   See, we talked about prioritizing the presence of God.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.220]   Jesus was forsaken from the presence of God
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:23.340]   so that we could be brought into the presence of God.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.100]   When Jesus hung on the cross, you know what he declared?
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:30.180]   "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.700]   He was forsaken so that we could be accepted.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.140]   We talked about trembling at God's holiness.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.540]   Jesus Christ was and is holy.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:42.300]   And yet he came so that us unholy people,
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.740]   through his death, burial, and resurrection,
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.740]   could be made right with a God who is holy, holy, holy.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:53.180]   We talked about treasuring God's commands.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.980]   Jesus fulfilled all of God's commands perfectly.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.780]   He lived the life that you and I never could
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.740]   so that every single one of us
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:07.220]   who constantly fall short of God's standard
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:10.940]   can still have the love, acceptance, and approval of God,
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:15.220]   not because of what we will earn through performance,
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:18.220]   but because of receiving Jesus Christ
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:22.020]   in his perfect work for us on the cross.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.740]   And then we talked about rejecting man's opposition.
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.940]   Jesus was spit at, laughed at, and mocked.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.740]   And he endured man's opposition
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:36.740]   so that we could experience God's acceptance.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.660]   This is Jesus.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.420]   Do you know him?
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.060]   If not, the invitation to you tonight
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.700]   is simply to come and know him as your Lord and Savior.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.740]   Let's pray together.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:58.780]   Lord Jesus, I pray
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:02.940]   that you would do a work in our hearts tonight.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.460]   God, I would imagine that there's people in this room
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.020]   who are like, "I'm not good and I'm not godly.
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.940]   "I'm far from both."
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:17.020]   And I just wonder if there's anyone in here
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:22.020]   who feels like that train has left the station,
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.700]   like there's no hope for them
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.260]   because of where they've been or what they've done.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.740]   And I just thank you, Jesus,
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:37.620]   that what you did on the cross was sufficient for everyone,
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:42.100]   that anyone who would call upon the name of the Lord
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.340]   shall be saved,
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:47.900]   that complete forgiveness is on the table tonight,
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:53.860]   that instantaneously we can go from being enemies of God
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.100]   to being children of God,
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.820]   that we can go from being wicked in your sight
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:04.060]   to being godly in your sight, all because of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:07.380]   Lord, I thank you that if we know you,
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.380]   you put your spirit in us,
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.060]   and your spirit is the one who goes to work in us,
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.780]   that obeying your commands isn't just something
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.740]   that we have to muscle up every day,
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.460]   but your spirit actually is the one
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.540]   who is at work in our lives.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.620]   So I pray that my friends wouldn't leave here
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.580]   thinking that they just need to do a bunch more.
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.660]   I pray that they would realize that the key to godliness,
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.100]   it starts with surrender.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.060]   It just starts with waking up every day,
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.940]   acknowledging your holiness,
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:42.300]   and surrendering to your leadership
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.140]   on a moment-by-moment basis.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.140]   Lord, would you do a good work in our lives?
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:46.980]   We need you.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.220]   We love you.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.380]   In Jesus' name.
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:43:01.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
