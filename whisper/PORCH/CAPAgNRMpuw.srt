1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:28,740
 - What's up, Porch family?

3
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,080
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,920
 Hey, welcome friends in the room,

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,040
 friends in Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix, Arizona,

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,320
 Boise, Idaho, Northwest Arkansas, Philadelphia,

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,520
 and all the Porch Live locations,

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,720
 everybody joining us online.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,880
 We are continuing this series,

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,040
 Fortune Telling, if we haven't met,

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,860
 my name is Dave and I have the privilege of serving

12
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,440
 and being a part of leading on the team that is here.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,620
 And I could not be more excited

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,120
 for what God is about to do tonight.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,920
 There's a good friend of mine that has been a integral part

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,280
 of how God has started a movement of young adults

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,000
 in this city who is joining us tonight

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,920
 that I'm about to introduce.

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
 But in terms of communicators, in terms of pastors,

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,160
 in terms of followers of Jesus,

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,040
 I cannot, and I mean those words very seriously,

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,760
 think of a single person I could be more excited

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,640
 to step up, open God's word, and teach us here.

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,920
 Tonight, Jonathan Pucluta.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,320
 (audience cheering)

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,240
 From Harris Creek, who if you haven't,

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,840
 if you're unaware of, the three of you who don't,

28
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,000
 JP's been a part of the Porch for a decade

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,680
 and got to serve as one of the closest friends in the world,

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,520
 one of the best teachers of God's word

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,320
 when they write the history book

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,820
 of the church in North America 100 years from now.

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,200
 It would surprise me if they don't mention his name.

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
 And the impact that he has had on young adults,

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,920
 it would be embarrassing for me to attempt

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,480
 to communicate how much and how many eternities

37
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,600
 have been impacted and changed and transformed.

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,700
 So with that being said, will you guys please

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,080
 welcome to the stage Jonathan Pucluta.

40
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,080
 (audience cheering)

41
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:14,920
 - He said that just like I wrote it down, so I'm thankful.

42
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,120
 Man, just a tremendous encourager to me.

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,560
 People ask me, was it hard to leave the Porch?

44
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,320
 It was hard to leave the people.

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,040
 It wasn't difficult to hand it over to excellent leadership.

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,640
 And so I'm so excited to be with you guys tonight.

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,960
 I know we prayed honestly,

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,040
 everyone should go home after Davy's prayer.

49
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,800
 I was like, wow.

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
 She said propitiation, man.

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,480
 I'm like, let's, amen.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,060
 Father, would you open our hearts?

53
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,080
 And if there's a word that you have for us tonight,

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,760
 as we open these ancient truths,

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,240
 would you help us to walk to our car

56
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,840
 in just a moment different?

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,600
 And I know that we're on the front lines this evening

58
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,960
 because we're talking about something

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,120
 that Satan has come after with full force.

60
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,220
 And so would you protect our minds?

61
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,200
 Would you protect our hearts?

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,040
 Would you remove distractions if we're in the loft?

63
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,320
 If we're in another room right now,

64
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,920
 would you remove distractions, give us laser focus,

65
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,580
 help us to hear what we're supposed to hear,

66
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,920
 help me not get in the way.

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,100
 If I say something they're not supposed to hear,

68
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,780
 supernaturally erase it.

69
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,120
 And if I say something consistent with you and your word,

70
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,760
 would you allow it to ring true?

71
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,540
 In Jesus' name, amen.

72
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,280
 My buddy texts me and says,

73
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,660
 "Hey, do you wanna go to the mall?"

74
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,800
 And I'm a shopper, okay?

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,760
 Like I know some guys are like, "Ooh, the mall, gross."

76
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,040
 I'm not that kind of guy.

77
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,360
 Like I'm like, I love the mall.

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,040
 And I'm an Enneagram seven.

79
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,480
 So like if you text me and say, "Do you wanna go?"

80
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,320
 Like really, like, "Do you wanna go get a spinal tap?"

81
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,240
 Yeah, anywhere.

82
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,080
 Like if I can get out of the house, like I'm in.

83
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
 So I'm like, "Yeah, of course I wanna go to the mall."

84
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,840
 And so he honestly, he's not the kind of guy

85
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,880
 to say that to.

86
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,480
 Like he's not the shopper, like I'm the shopper,

87
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,320
 but he's like, "Hey, do you wanna go?"

88
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,040
 I'm like, "Yes, I wanna go to the mall."

89
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,620
 And so he's like, "All right, I'm picking you up

90
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,060
 "on the way to pick you up."

91
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,940
 And so he does, he picks me up,

92
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,900
 and we're driving to the mall, and I ask him,

93
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,820
 his name is Marshall, right?

94
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,420
 And I say, "Hey, what are you going to the mall for?

95
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,620
 "Like this is not like you just randomly

96
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,660
 "in the afternoon to go to the mall.

97
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,700
 "What are you going for?"

98
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,220
 And he says, "I need a new raincoat."

99
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,100
 And I'm like, "Oh yeah, raincoat,

100
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,780
 "because you know, there's been some precipitation lately.

101
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,340
 "So you know, you wanna, you know, get a raincoat."

102
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,780
 Like I get it, like his other one,

103
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,640
 he's like, "I got a tear in it."

104
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,140
 So I'm like, "Cool, man, I'm your wingman.

105
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,540
 "Like I got you.

106
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,600
 "Like I know the mall, I used to work there.

107
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,860
 "You know, I'm gonna hook you, we're gonna go,

108
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,780
 "and I'll help you."

109
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,300
 I'm like, "What are you looking for in a raincoat?"

110
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,180
 And this is what he says.

111
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,180
 He says, "I'm looking for a North Face Venture 2 color TH

112
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,920
 "in black size medium with a cinched hood

113
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,640
 "and a Gore-Tex lining to keep the water out."

114
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,420
 I was like, "Oh, you're looking for that raincoat, okay."

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,180
 All right, yeah, okay.

116
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,640
 And so it's really interesting the way

117
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,840
 that we shot the experience that ensued there.

118
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,440
 Because like, we go into the mall,

119
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,700
 but we just go to the stores that sell raincoats.

120
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,120
 And when he walks into the store,

121
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,040
 you know, the guy's up there, up front,

122
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,400
 he's like, "Hey, sir, can I help you?

123
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,680
 "You know, we have some pants on."

124
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,200
 He's like, "No, no, no, raincoat."

125
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,320
 And he goes straight to the rounder that sells raincoats,

126
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,460
 and then he goes straight to the section

127
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,140
 that has North Face, then he goes straight to the black ones,

128
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,700
 and then he starts looking at the label for Venture 2,

129
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,140
 like just laser focused.

130
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,940
 Like, that's not how I shop.

131
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,780
 Like, how I shop, like I go in the mall,

132
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,620
 and I'm like, â™ª Spirit lead me where â™ª

133
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,180
 You know, I'm like, I'm like, "Where, what is it?"

134
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,540
 Like, I'm open to being sold.

135
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,180
 You know, I got a little money in my pocket.

136
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,620
 Like, guy comes up, he's like,

137
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,220
 "Hey, you know, are you looking for anything particular?"

138
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,620
 I'm like, "No, I'm not looking for anything particular."

139
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,600
 He's like, "Well, we got, you know, we got these two for one."

140
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,120
 I'm like, "Show me, show me, I want the sale.

141
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,600
 "Like, where's the deal?"

142
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,200
 You know, and you find yourself when you don't know,

143
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,780
 when you're not looking for something,

144
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,920
 you have to look at everything, right?

145
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,400
 And so I'm looking at everything,

146
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,320
 and you kind of wander into Zoomies,

147
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,240
 you're like, "Oh man, maybe I need a longboard, you know,

148
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,320
 "'cause I've only got three."

149
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,920
 And then some dude's like, "Hey, you need some shoes?"

150
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,080
 I'm like, "Yes, I do need some shoe.

151
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,780
 "I only have 37 pair, yes."

152
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,800
 You know, and then you find yourself in Brookstone,

153
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,680
 and you're like looking at some head massager,

154
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,520
 hypothetically speaking, you know,

155
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
 and it like makes your hair grow.

156
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,760
 And all of a sudden I'm like, "Maybe I need this.

157
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,680
 "Like, maybe I don't have enough hair."

158
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,440
 And you just, if you don't know what you're looking for,

159
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,500
 you can't find it.

160
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,160
 And most of us date the way that I shop.

161
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,800
 Like, I've spent a lot of time with single people.

162
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,240
 We go throughout the world.

163
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,740
 We're trying to find the one.

164
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,260
 And if you were honest, like if I was to survey you guys,

165
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,620
 I'd say, "What are you looking for?

166
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
 "How are you gonna know?

167
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,300
 "And you're gonna say dumb things to me."

168
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,700
 Like, "Well, you just know when you know."

169
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,060
 Anybody ever told you that?

170
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,940
 You just know when you know.

171
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,060
 You just know when you, and you would say this,

172
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,140
 you say, "Well, I'm looking for someone who makes me feel."

173
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,620
 And you fill in the blank.

174
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,460
 "Someone who makes me feel beautiful.

175
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,000
 "Someone who makes me feel good.

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,480
 "Someone who makes me feel great.

177
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,820
 "Someone who makes me feel special.

178
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,060
 "You're looking for someone who makes me feel."

179
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,300
 But here's the public service announcement up front.

180
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,760
 Feelings come and go.

181
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,620
 Whoever you marry, you're gonna be laying in bed with them

182
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,680
 beside them one day, and you're gonna wake up,

183
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,500
 and you're gonna be like, "I don't feel anything."

184
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,620
 And what your pagan friends are gonna say,

185
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,220
 "I've fallen out of love.

186
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,820
 "I married the wrong person.

187
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,120
 "And I'm not saying that it's gonna stay that way.

188
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,060
 "I don't know."

189
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,220
 I'm just telling you, feelings come and go.

190
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,820
 And if you don't know what you're looking for,

191
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,660
 you won't find it.

192
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,860
 So we're in this series, Fortune Telling,

193
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,180
 where we're looking at what the scripture

194
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,100
 says about our future, how it informs it.

195
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,800
 And what I wanna talk about this evening

196
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,940
 for the few minutes that I have you

197
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,280
 is who you should marry.

198
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,240
 Magic eight ball, who am I gonna marry?

199
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,580
 God, who should I marry?

200
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,340
 And I'm gonna give you a verse from the scripture.

201
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,860
 I'm gonna be in 1 Timothy chapter four,

202
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,060
 if you wanna turn there.

203
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,540
 I'm gonna give you an amazing list from the scripture

204
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,900
 of who you should marry.

205
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,460
 And who should I marry is really who to look for.

206
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,220
 It's really who to date.

207
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,420
 But it's honestly, guys, listen, it's who to be.

208
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,100
 Because I'm sure you've heard here before,

209
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,020
 if you've been here long,

210
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,300
 you wanna become someone

211
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,200
 that someone you're looking for is looking for.

212
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,580
 You wanna be someone that someone you're looking for

213
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,420
 is looking for.

214
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,020
 So this message tonight, regardless of where you're at,

215
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,420
 whether you're seriously dating,

216
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,620
 single, never been asked out, you desire marriage,

217
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,140
 maybe you're called to singleness,

218
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,820
 if it's not who should I marry, then it's who should I be?

219
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,500
 I should become this person

220
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,780
 because this is what the scripture informs us.

221
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,440
 And let me just start with an apology up front.

222
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,340
 The church, big C church, has missed it.

223
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,380
 And I'm sorry, as a pastor and a leader of a local church,

224
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,380
 I want to ask your forgiveness

225
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,820
 because the church has made this tremendous mistake

226
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,460
 in the 21st century of elevating marriage above singleness.

227
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,620
 And that's an unbiblical, anti-biblical idea.

228
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,660
 That's not what the Bible teaches.

229
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,980
 The Bible teaches that singleness is a gift.

230
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,780
 And you're like, I roll moment, does it have a receipt?

231
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,620
 Can I return it?

232
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,700
 Can I exchange it for what kind of gift is it?

233
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,580
 No, but it's a gift.

234
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,180
 That's what the scripture says.

235
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,980
 And so I promise you what's true about it,

236
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,340
 it is a gift.

237
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,820
 That's what Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter seven,

238
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,660
 verse seven.

239
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,020
 And Paul, the apostle who was single,

240
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,980
 who wrote 80% of the New Testament,

241
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,240
 is plagiarizing the words of Jesus in Matthew 19,

242
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,660
 when Jesus says, "There are some who are celibate

243
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,920
 "for the sake of the kingdom.

244
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,300
 "Not everyone can accept it, but those who can should."

245
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,820
 So Jesus, who was also single and 33 years old,

246
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,820
 elevates the calling of singleness on par with marriage.

247
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,020
 And so if you're single, it's okay.

248
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,580
 You're not second class, you're not junior varsity,

249
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,500
 you're not JV, you have this tremendous calling

250
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,980
 on your life like Jesus.

251
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,720
 And we don't know if it's for a day or for a year

252
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,300
 or for 20 years or a lifetime.

253
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,100
 We don't know, none of us can see the future.

254
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,100
 But if you desire marriage, this is who you should look for.

255
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,740
 I'm telling you who you should look for.

256
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,300
 And the way that we find, how do we find someone to marry?

257
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,120
 What do we do?

258
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,720
 It's not rhetorical, what do we do?

259
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,400
 We go on Tinder.

260
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,760
 No, no, no, what do we do?

261
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,840
 (audience laughing)

262
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,280
 Bumble, no, no, no, what do we do, what do we do?

263
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,400
 We date, yeah, we date.

264
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,360
 We date, thank you, David.

265
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,200
 You're listening.

266
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
 Thank you.

267
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,040
 You date, this is dating, it's a modern idea

268
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,280
 and it's our method of trying to find a suitable spouse.

269
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,100
 That's why we date.

270
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,440
 You're trying to find a suitable spouse.

271
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,320
 Now, that's not what the world says.

272
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,160
 The world says date for fun, date for the feels,

273
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,360
 date to experience the opposite sex,

274
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,440
 date for the experience.

275
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
 Dating is about 120 years old.

276
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,880
 It entered the English language

277
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,360
 as a euphemism for prostitution.

278
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,560
 Think about this, guys.

279
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,440
 Prior to 120 years ago, no one in the history of the world

280
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,840
 had ever gone on a date.

281
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,240
 Crazy.

282
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,320
 Before 120 years ago, no one had gone on a date.

283
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,680
 That wasn't a method.

284
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,200
 That was invented 120 years ago

285
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,440
 and it enters the English language

286
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,240
 as a euphemism for prostitution

287
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,480
 because to go on a date was to exchange

288
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,640
 an experience for sexual favors.

289
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,040
 Now, if you think about how we date in the 21st century,

290
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
 in the world, we haven't come that far.

291
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,000
 That's still very much how the world dates.

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 We exchange an experience.

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,120
 Take me to my favorite restaurant.

294
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,000
 Give me my favorite drink, favorite appetizer.

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,760
 Let's go, we're talking.

296
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,440
 And maybe you'll get lucky somehow, some way.

297
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
 That's how the world dates.

298
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,200
 I mean, just call it, saying like it is.

299
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,080
 You guys are staring at me like, wait, is he serious?

300
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,680
 Yes, that's what your friends do.

301
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,200
 I know not you, guy, we're in church.

302
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,760
 I'm saying that's what people do though, right?

303
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:44,200
 And we have more help than we've ever had.

304
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,040
 We've got dating apps, dating websites,

305
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,720
 personality tests, compatibility tests,

306
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,720
 professional matchmakers, and we're the worst at marriage

307
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,000
 than any generation in the history of history.

308
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,040
 What happened, what's wrong?

309
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,640
 People are sliding into DMs, they're ghosting each other.

310
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,280
 We don't, we're not sincere in our love,

311
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,440
 like Romans 12, nine says.

312
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,320
 We do what we wanna do, we're cowards, we hide.

313
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,560
 We hide behind technology.

314
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,560
 We basically outsource this whole thing to a web developer.

315
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,800
 And you're left brokenhearted,

316
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,680
 and I know a lot of you have cried yourself to sleep.

317
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,520
 Probably most of you have cried yourself to sleep.

318
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,920
 And guys, I wanna ask you a question.

319
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,160
 I've been spending a lot of time in this book.

320
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,620
 What if our hearts weren't meant to be broken?

321
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,640
 What if God didn't make breakable hearts?

322
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,640
 What if he never intended for your heart to be broken?

323
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,960
 And in reality, we're getting married later,

324
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,200
 we're getting married less, and marriages aren't lasting.

325
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,560
 And so if dating is the pathway to the promise of marriage,

326
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,800
 we're doing something wrong.

327
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,240
 And I'm just here, I'm raising my hand,

328
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,480
 and say, hey, something's gotta change.

329
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,320
 And so what I'm gonna say tonight is crazy in some ways,

330
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,480
 but just apply logic and grab God's word,

331
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,600
 and prove to me, if you can,

332
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,680
 from the word of God that I'm wrong.

333
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,220
 'Cause I'm really just plagiarizing some truths

334
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,520
 that were written.

335
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,960
 I'm really just gonna give you one verse

336
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,720
 with a lot of supporting verses tonight.

337
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,040
 But let me give you some stats up front.

338
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,600
 1967 out of 10 people in their 20s were married,

339
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,720
 compared with just two out of 10 today.

340
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,760
 For the first time in history,

341
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,560
 the average American now spends more years

342
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,320
 single than married.

343
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,880
 About 50% of marriages end in divorce.

344
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,360
 Now, let me say that 50% is made of 41% of first marriages,

345
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,820
 60% of second marriages, and 73% of third marriages.

346
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,240
 So a lot of different things that make up that stat.

347
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
 But let's just say you say, no, no, I think it's 40%.

348
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,860
 Let me tell you something.

349
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,940
 Most marriages fail miserably.

350
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,000
 That's the truth.

351
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,400
 Most marriages fail miserably.

352
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,480
 Because of those that stay married,

353
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,660
 there's a bunch of them that are unhappily undivorced.

354
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,100
 Like, this is some of your parents.

355
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,320
 They don't love each other, they're not intimate, right?

356
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,800
 They're celibate or they're unfaithful.

357
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,720
 They're roommates.

358
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,500
 Sometimes they sleep in separate rooms or separate beds,

359
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,340
 and they're not happy.

360
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,760
 So they're not divorced, but they're not happy.

361
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,280
 So the smallest demographic is people

362
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,980
 who are joyfully married and stay married and stay joyful.

363
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,580
 That's the smallest demographic.

364
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,860
 Here's what I want you to know.

365
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,700
 Here's why I left my family tonight.

366
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,820
 Here's why I drove two hours to be here,

367
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,560
 is because I want that to be every single person

368
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,020
 who desires marriage, I want that to be you.

369
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,900
 And I believe it's available to you

370
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,500
 if you will lean into the word of God

371
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,420
 for the next few minutes together.

372
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,980
 That you could be joyfully married

373
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,460
 for the rest of your life.

374
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,580
 Good.

375
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,420
 - I love it.

376
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,240
 - Good.

377
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,180
 (congregation laughing)

378
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,880
 So I'm gonna give you five things.

379
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,500
 Five things to look for.

380
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,460
 Because I think one of the greatest problems

381
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,200
 is people don't know what to look for,

382
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,860
 and you cannot find it if you don't know

383
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,420
 what you're looking for.

384
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,260
 So I'm gonna give you five things.

385
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,320
 This is a great list.

386
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,720
 This list was not preserved for dating.

387
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,580
 Dating was nowhere in the Bible, believe it or not.

388
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,860
 The internet's nowhere in the Bible.

389
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,940
 It wasn't invented yet, right?

390
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,140
 And so the Bible does not speak to dating.

391
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,700
 It does speak to relationships.

392
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,140
 And it does speak to discipleship.

393
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,340
 Tonight's a discipleship message.

394
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,700
 These five things is what the Apostle Paul tells Timothy,

395
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,260
 hey, this is what you should do.

396
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,580
 This is what you should be.

397
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,380
 Be an example of this, Timothy.

398
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,820
 Timothy, also single.

399
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,100
 Paul, single, writing to Timothy, who's single,

400
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,420
 who says this, verse 12.

401
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,580
 "Don't let anyone look down on you because you're young."

402
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,780
 Well, we read that and we think,

403
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,060
 oh, is he 16, is he 14, 13?

404
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,860
 He's older than most of you.

405
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,060
 He's about 40 years old when he writes this.

406
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,080
 Yeah, I know, crazy.

407
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,100
 It's good news for me that the Bible says that's young.

408
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,980
 "Don't let anyone look down on you because you're young,

409
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,700
 "but instead, rather, set an example

410
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,660
 "for the believers in speech."

411
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,280
 You see five things, speech, conduct,

412
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,280
 in love, in faith, and in purity.

413
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,660
 Give you five questions to ask.

414
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,900
 You're on a date, these are the five questions you ask.

415
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,140
 Because all you're doing on a date

416
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,380
 is you're trying to find, will there be a suitable spouse?

417
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,660
 So you're trying to have experiences

418
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,940
 that would allow you to see and determine

419
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,480
 if they would be a great husband or a great wife,

420
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,700
 a great mom or a great dad.

421
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,820
 That's all you're trying to do.

422
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,620
 And you wanna do that as quickly and effectively

423
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,580
 as you possibly can, because dating's the interview,

424
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,460
 it's not the fun part.

425
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,920
 It's like the challenges of marriage

426
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,820
 without the fun stuff, right?

427
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,140
 And so the first question,

428
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,120
 do they set an example in their speech?

429
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,160
 That's the first question.

430
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,060
 Do they set an example in their speech?

431
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,900
 Now this is huge.

432
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,600
 This is much more important than you think it is.

433
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,000
 Here's another way to ask it.

434
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 What do they say?

435
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,560
 What comes out of their mouth?

436
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,720
 Do they gossip?

437
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,800
 Like I was on a date with a girl prior to Monica.

438
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,360
 And the only thing that she wanted to talk about

439
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,720
 is everyone who wasn't there.

440
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,320
 Like going on a date with her was like being

441
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,860
 in the grocery store aisle and looking at all the tabloids.

442
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,700
 Did you know?

443
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,520
 Did you know?

444
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,360
 Did you know?

445
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,180
 Did you know he?

446
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,020
 Did you know she?

447
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,860
 Did you know they?

448
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,440
 Like we had nothing else to talk about.

449
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,400
 That's the ungodly.

450
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,640
 That's a giant red flag.

451
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,940
 If you're on a first date with someone

452
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,880
 and they want to talk about someone who's not present,

453
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,200
 that's not a good sign.

454
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,140
 What comes out of their mouth?

455
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,720
 Do they tear people down?

456
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,640
 Guys, man.

457
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,080
 Marriage is hard.

458
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
 Some of you need to hear that,

459
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,680
 but some of you need to hear marriage is good.

460
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,520
 Marriage is good.

461
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,340
 Singleness is good.

462
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,180
 It's good.

463
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,020
 It's a good thing.

464
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,400
 The Bible calls it, says marriage is good,

465
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,540
 but it's also hard.

466
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,380
 After a long day of work,

467
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,000
 after a lot of challenges in ministry,

468
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,360
 I walk through that door, praise God.

469
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,680
 I married a cheerleader.

470
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,520
 Praise God.

471
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,900
 And I don't mean cheerleader like you think I mean.

472
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,740
 I mean that she says,

473
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,080
 "Hey, I just want to remind you that God loves you

474
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,320
 "and that he's good and that he's in control

475
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,180
 "and that you got this and you can keep going

476
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,000
 "and I'm here for you.

477
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,480
 "I want you to know that."

478
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,320
 Right?

479
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,400
 Are they negative?

480
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
 Guys, marriage is hard.

481
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,960
 If they're negative, that's a beat down.

482
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,000
 Like that's gonna be a lot more difficult

483
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,760
 to partner up in ministry with someone

484
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,800
 who's always negative.

485
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,120
 Do they curse in anger?

486
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,320
 James 1:19, like what comes out of their mouth

487
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,020
 when they're squeezed?

488
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,280
 Not when they're sitting across the table from you

489
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,040
 at their favorite restaurant,

490
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,980
 ordering their favorite food.

491
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,320
 What comes out of their mouth when they're squeezed, man?

492
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,520
 Like when they slam their finger in the car door.

493
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,020
 What comes out of their mouth?

494
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,680
 Because that's what's gonna show you what's in their heart.

495
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,160
 This is what Jesus says in Luke 6.

496
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,600
 "A good man brings good things

497
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,120
 "out of the good stored up in his heart

498
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,640
 "and an evil man brings evil things

499
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,240
 "out of the evil stored up in his heart.

500
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,800
 "For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of."

501
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,220
 What comes out of their mouth?

502
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,920
 You want to know what kind of heart they have?

503
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,440
 Look at their words.

504
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,480
 I'm walking to the porch one day,

505
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,280
 I mean totally about to preach

506
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,520
 and this dude walks by and I'm thinking,

507
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,200
 you know, porchy, awesome, and I'm like,

508
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,920
 "Hey, buddy," and he goes, "Get the F away from me."

509
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,480
 Oh, wow, not a fan, I get it, you know, okay.

510
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,440
 I say, "Hey, man, everything okay?"

511
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,040
 He goes, "Leave me the F alone."

512
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,920
 I go, "Hey, buddy, I don't want to get dirty

513
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,760
 "before I preach, dude."

514
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,000
 Like, what, no, I'm kidding, I didn't say that.

515
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,440
 I was like, "Hey, everything," I was like,

516
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,960
 "You all right, man, you okay?"

517
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,520
 He goes, "I'm looking for the F in hospital."

518
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,680
 I go, "Well, you're in the wrong place."

519
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,760
 And he goes, "What?"

520
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,520
 I go, "Yeah, it's in the hospital."

521
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,120
 I was like, "This is a church."

522
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,600
 And he's looking for a medical city, like down the road.

523
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,320
 I say, "Hey, I'm literally, I'm like 10 minutes

524
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,600
 "from meeting," I'm like, "Hey, get in the car,

525
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,160
 "I'll take you there," and I zip him down,

526
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,000
 dump him off at the ER, right, and you know,

527
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,160
 like good Samaritan kind of like leaves, no.

528
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,800
 Anyway, so leave him there, come back, preach,

529
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,240
 the hospital is closed afterwards,

530
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,720
 so go back the next day, check on him.

531
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,360
 What had happened is his appendix had ruptured, right?

532
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,800
 Spewed evil all throughout his, I mean evil,

533
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,260
 spewed poison all throughout his body.

534
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,720
 (congregation laughing)

535
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,240
 Poison all throughout his body,

536
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,880
 and because there's poison inside of him,

537
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,520
 there's poison coming out of him, right?

538
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,080
 Because as I asked if he was a Christian,

539
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
 he's like, "Oh yeah, I'm a Christian."

540
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,680
 I'm like, "That's really confusing, man, based on,"

541
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,040
 you know, and as I clarified the gospel,

542
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,600
 it turns out he wasn't a Christian,

543
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,240
 and he called himself a Christian.

544
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,220
 But when he was displaying the things in his heart,

545
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,680
 you wanna know what comes out of their mouth

546
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,480
 when they're squeezed,

547
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,040
 and so you wanna create an environment

548
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,060
 so that you can see what comes out of their mouth

549
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,900
 when they're squeezed.

550
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,040
 What I'm saying is you want to, you know,

551
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,480
 slam their finger in the car door,

552
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,440
 so no, I'm kidding, don't do that.

553
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,380
 But think about how can I see that, right?

554
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,920
 Because their words show their hearts,

555
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,800
 and that their actions are gonna follow their words,

556
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,640
 and that's number two,

557
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
 do they set an example in their conduct?

558
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,480
 Do they set an example in their conduct?

559
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,320
 Here's how I would ask this.

560
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,180
 What is their reputation?

561
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:16,140
 What is their, 'cause reputation is a lot of conduct

562
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,560
 stacked on top of each other over time,

563
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,480
 not just a Taylor Swift album.

564
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,280
 Like, it's what they've been doing for a long period of time

565
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,040
 and this is what the scripture says,

566
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,320
 Proverbs 20, verse 11,

567
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,900
 "Even small children are known by their actions,

568
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,760
 "so is their conduct really pure and upright?"

569
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,140
 What are they known for?

570
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,560
 And this is one of the challenges of online dating,

571
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,120
 and I'm not completely against it

572
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,280
 'cause the Bible isn't completely against it.

573
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,380
 I would just say be wise,

574
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,000
 and there's two rules to online dating, okay?

575
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,880
 Rule number one, profiles lie.

576
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,200
 Like, anybody can be anyone on the internet.

577
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,020
 They can graduate from seminary and pastor a church

578
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,680
 and memorize a bunch of scripture

579
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,800
 and not even be a Christian.

580
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 Profiles lie.

581
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,480
 Rule number two, and this is a big one,

582
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,440
 this is the one that's gonna upset you.

583
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,340
 Don't go on a date with strangers.

584
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,280
 Like, I take questions on Friday,

585
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,480
 this deal called Friday Q&A,

586
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,240
 and yeah, me and you.

587
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,240
 And I get about 2,000 questions every Friday,

588
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,140
 most of them on relationships,

589
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,960
 and one that I see about 10 times every Friday is,

590
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,560
 how do I, when I'm on a date,

591
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,120
 how do I figure out if he's a believer?

592
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,600
 Guys, listen, lean in, man.

593
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
 Long before you're on that date,

594
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,680
 sitting at a table with some dude,

595
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,400
 know if he's a believer or not.

596
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,760
 And you say, "Well, how do I find that out?"

597
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,900
 Check references.

598
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,800
 Like, not all online dating is created equal.

599
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 I would, if I'm gonna do that,

600
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,460
 I'm gonna go through the platforms

601
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,680
 that allow me to see common friends

602
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,840
 so that I can say, "Hey, do you know this guy?

603
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,680
 "Do you know where he goes to church?

604
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,840
 "Where does he serve?

605
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,040
 "Is he really running hard after Jesus?

606
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,400
 "Do you know her?

607
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,660
 "Is she solid?

608
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,280
 "What friend group does she hang in?"

609
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,280
 Check references prior to going on that date

610
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,440
 because here's why.

611
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,120
 Past performance is the best indicator

612
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,280
 of future performance.

613
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,120
 You understand?

614
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,440
 Past performance is the best indicator

615
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,680
 of future performance.

616
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,920
 A friend of mine was doing a wedding

617
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,960
 and the day before the wedding,

618
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,480
 the ex-wife shows up and says,

619
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,280
 "Hey, you know that he was arrested for physical abuse?"

620
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,200
 And my wife's like, "No, I didn't know that.

621
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,960
 "That never came up in the pre-marital counseling."

622
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,920
 And they're like, "Yeah, he was arrested."

623
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,960
 And my friend, so they sits down with both of them

624
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,760
 and say, "Hey, did you know he was arrested

625
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
 "for physical abuse?"

626
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,960
 And she was like, "No, I didn't know that."

627
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,500
 And he was like, "Oh, you know, she's crazy

628
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,800
 "and that's not exactly what happened."

629
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,060
 And my friend's like, "Yeah, but it seems like

630
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,640
 "you should've said that."

631
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,880
 And so I'm uncomfortable doing the wedding.

632
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,040
 When you mess with people's wedding,

633
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,560
 they get really upset.

634
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,920
 They were so mad.

635
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,840
 Like they left, so they're like,

636
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,000
 "Hey, we're not getting married here."

637
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,640
 They go somewhere else, they go to another church,

638
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,960
 they find another pastor, they get married.

639
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,880
 They go on the honeymoon and it's amazing

640
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,560
 as a lot of honeymoons are.

641
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,720
 They come back from the honeymoon,

642
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,480
 he throws her to the ground and breaks both of her arms.

643
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,160
 You know?

644
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,600
 And listen, people do change.

645
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,680
 That's what you're asking right now.

646
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,960
 Some of you are sitting next to each other,

647
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,120
 you're like, "Baby, I swear I'm different."

648
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,520
 People, people, I don't mean to make it awkward,

649
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,320
 I'm just saying I saw some elbowing.

650
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,360
 People do change, right?

651
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,800
 But you want a track record of faithfulness, right?

652
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,320
 You want their repentance.

653
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,720
 My friend Todd says this all the time.

654
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,800
 You want their repentance to be as notorious

655
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,760
 as their rebellion.

656
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,400
 That they're using their mess and that that's their message

657
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,920
 and they're leveraging that because they're different.

658
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,960
 They're not hiding it in the closet.

659
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,280
 They're like bringing it out for everyone to see

660
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,440
 that's this who I was, but Jesus changed me.

661
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,400
 My wife, I got her this Suburban, bought her this Suburban,

662
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,600
 but it had been wrecked really badly.

663
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,120
 And the fact that it was in that bad accident

664
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,960
 prior to us purchasing it kept everyone else away

665
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,280
 and they had to discount it a lot.

666
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,320
 That's the only kind of vehicle I buy

667
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,840
 is the deeply discounted kind.

668
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,280
 And so it was like majorly, majorly on sale.

669
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,120
 And it kept everyone else away,

670
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,240
 but here's why it didn't keep me away

671
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,840
 because I saw that after the wreck that it was repaired

672
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,440
 and they had been on the road faithfully for three years

673
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,160
 without any breakdowns.

674
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,240
 And I'm like, hey, I trust it

675
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,800
 because there's a track record of faithfulness.

676
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,240
 I know you're not buying a car,

677
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,480
 but you're looking for a spouse.

678
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,840
 You want a track record of faithfulness.

679
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,720
 And not just how they act with you

680
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,280
 because with you they're on the interview.

681
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,200
 Observe them when they're with somebody

682
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,160
 that can do nothing for them in return.

683
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,360
 How do they act towards someone

684
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,160
 who can do nothing for them in return?

685
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,240
 Because how they act will point to what they love.

686
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,160
 And that's the number three.

687
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,120
 Do they set an example in love?

688
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,200
 Do they set an example in love?

689
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,880
 What do they love?

690
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,440
 Do they love football?

691
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,520
 Do they love the Mavericks?

692
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,360
 Do they love money?

693
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
 Do they love children?

694
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,960
 Do they love their shih tzu?

695
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,720
 That's a dog.

696
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,400
 What do they love?

697
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,680
 And it's okay if they love things,

698
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,400
 but as you look at that list,

699
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,120
 you're gonna start to see their idols.

700
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,840
 And you wanna make sure that the greatest obsession

701
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,880
 of their life is the creator of the heavens and the earth,

702
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,160
 through his son, Jesus Christ.

703
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,880
 What do they love?

704
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
 When Jesus was on the earth, he talked about this.

705
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
 In fact, he summarized 644 laws of the prophets

706
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,040
 into two of the greatest commandments.

707
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,920
 And this is what he said, because it's about love.

708
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,280
 So listen, he said, Jesus replied,

709
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,000
 "Love the Lord your God with all your heart

710
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,280
 "and with all your soul and with all your mind."

711
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,680
 This is the first and greatest commandment.

712
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,680
 And the second is like it, love your neighbor as yourself.

713
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,240
 Do they love God?

714
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,720
 And do they love people?

715
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,600
 You're going to want to identify

716
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
 the affections of their heart.

717
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,880
 And here's how you do that.

718
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,240
 'Cause you're like, well, how do I do that?

719
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,520
 One, what comes out of their mouth.

720
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,360
 But two, where do they invest their time,

721
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,040
 talents, and treasures?

722
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,400
 Because that will show you what has their heart.

723
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,800
 Jesus says in Matthew six,

724
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,080
 where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

725
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,920
 So wherever they're investing time,

726
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,680
 wherever they're spending money,

727
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,560
 wherever they're using their gifts,

728
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,760
 that's going to show you the objects of their heart.

729
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,900
 Is that, like are they serving in the nursery?

730
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,120
 They love church, hey, I'm going on mission trips.

731
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,960
 I'm always with God.

732
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,520
 I got community tonight, can't hang, sorry.

733
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,720
 No, I'm reading the Bible.

734
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,840
 I woke up this morning.

735
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,280
 Can't wait to get into God's word.

736
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,120
 Or are they like, man, the masks are on.

737
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,000
 Call you later.

738
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,920
 Don't interrupt me.

739
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,880
 What do they love?

740
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,800
 I talked to this young adult here one time.

741
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
 Right here, he's like, man, yeah, dude, I love,

742
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
 man, I love this play, I love God.

743
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,480
 Love God.

744
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,000
 Me and God, man, love it.

745
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,840
 Yeah.

746
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,800
 I'm like, oh, that's good, man.

747
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,640
 What's he teaching right now?

748
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,360
 Trust in the Lord with all your heart.

749
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,160
 Lean not on your own understanding.

750
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,040
 In all your ways, acknowledge him,

751
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,600
 and he will make your path straight.

752
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,440
 I love God.

753
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,800
 Proverbs 3, five and six, man.

754
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,640
 That's cool, man, that's great.

755
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,800
 You got any other verses?

756
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,800
 I love the Proverbs, especially chapter three.

757
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,560
 Love God.

758
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,400
 I was like, that's cool, man.

759
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,160
 So where are you being instructed right now?

760
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,840
 Like, where do you go to church?

761
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,280
 Nah, nah, nah, church, that's not really my thing.

762
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,760
 The institution, you know, it's all corporate and stuff.

763
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,360
 That's not my, it's me and Jesus.

764
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,200
 Like, I love God.

765
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,280
 Like, it's just me and God.

766
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,480
 I love God.

767
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,960
 You know, oh, yeah, you don't really,

768
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,040
 so you're not a part of a church.

769
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,960
 No, man, I'm not in a church.

770
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,240
 You know, that's just not how I do,

771
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
 like, me and God, that's not what we do.

772
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,240
 And besides, the Cowboys play on Sunday,

773
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,560
 and I got this spot, like, where my boys,

774
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,840
 like, we go, it's Hellgate.

775
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,760
 It's kind of an all-day affair.

776
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,000
 And, you know, it's evangelistic, right?

777
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,800
 Evangelical, you might say.

778
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,520
 We go, and I'm like, it's a place

779
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,840
 where we just hang out all day.

780
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,200
 And I'm like, oh, and we talk more.

781
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,640
 And it turns out, this is what I told them,

782
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,480
 'cause this is where we went.

783
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,440
 I said, oh, I do think you love God,

784
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,600
 and the Cowboys are your God, right?

785
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,800
 You're fooling yourself.

786
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,040
 You have a greater obsession than the creator

787
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,720
 of the heavens and the earth, so let's just be honest.

788
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,640
 And it's not just what do they love, friends,

789
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,920
 it's how do they love.

790
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,120
 Do they lead people better than they found them?

791
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,800
 Can I talk about checking references?

792
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,720
 Like, when their ex, all their exes

793
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,560
 are just really angry at them,

794
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,320
 like, they created TikTok sites just to bash them,

795
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,000
 like, they're so hurt by them.

796
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,120
 That's, like, you're probably gonna be one of those exes.

797
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,320
 That's their track record.

798
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,320
 You want to date someone who leads people

799
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,920
 better than they found them, and that is possible.

800
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,840
 It is possible.

801
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,320
 I know that's different than how the world dates,

802
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,320
 but it is very, very possible.

803
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,200
 And so what environments will show you what they love most?

804
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,080
 That's where you want to go,

805
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,440
 because what they love will point to what they believe,

806
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,720
 and what they believe, that's their faith,

807
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,480
 and that's number four, do they set an example in faith?

808
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,880
 What do they believe?

809
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,880
 I'm not saying, do they identify as a Christian?

810
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,360
 That's a different question.

811
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,080
 I can identify as a giraffe.

812
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,960
 It does not make me a giraffe.

813
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,200
 Like, I can say that I'm anything, right?

814
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,600
 But that doesn't make me that thing.

815
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,760
 I'm saying, have they trusted fully?

816
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,720
 Listen, lean in, this is the important part.

817
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,320
 Had they fully given themselves to the death

818
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,280
 and the resurrection of Jesus Christ

819
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,840
 for the forgiveness of their sins,

820
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,680
 not in some kind of check the box,

821
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,320
 oh, when I was six years old, I went down to the front,

822
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,640
 I said a prayer, and it has had no impact

823
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,800
 on my life since then.

824
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,600
 I'm talking about, are they running hard after Jesus?

825
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,560
 Like, do they love him?

826
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,120
 Does their life display that they are madly in love

827
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,960
 with the one who literally, quite literally died for them

828
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,000
 to save them from hell?

829
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,960
 Does that mark their lives?

830
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,080
 And that's the gospel, that's the good news.

831
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,440
 2 Corinthians 6:14 says,

832
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,640
 "Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers."

833
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,920
 Do not date someone thinking you can change them.

834
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,720
 You're not a dating missionary.

835
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,120
 That is not your spiritual gift,

836
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,560
 and it is not the calling on your life, okay?

837
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,640
 You date someone who has radically given their heart

838
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,400
 to the Lord, and you be that person.

839
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,680
 Like, you're in a church on a Tuesday night.

840
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,480
 That's a really good sign.

841
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,320
 It doesn't mean everything, it just means at least,

842
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,640
 you're headed in the right direction.

843
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,160
 Even if you came here because you wanna disprove

844
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,680
 Christianity, like, you don't understand what's happening.

845
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,560
 God has unleashed the hounds of heaven after you,

846
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,080
 and he's gonna win, it's gonna be awesome.

847
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,520
 I'm so glad you're here.

848
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,600
 You know who you are.

849
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,920
 And, right, you want to find someone

850
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,360
 who's in love with God.

851
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,520
 And I'll just tell you, like, as a dude who's done

852
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,960
 a lot of marriage counseling,

853
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,720
 and a lot of pre-marriage counseling,

854
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,800
 it's half the battle.

855
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,960
 Man, they have the Jesus thing, right?

856
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,720
 It covers a multitude of sins.

857
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,600
 Like, if you just find somebody who is radically

858
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,680
 in love with Christ, like, not check the box

859
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,800
 kind of world, lukewarm Christian, cultural Christian,

860
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,760
 no, I'm not talking about that.

861
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,120
 I'm talking about somebody that just delights in God.

862
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,400
 Like, you're gonna be fine.

863
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,040
 If you're that and they're that.

864
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,360
 Did you know that there's never,

865
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,120
 let's talk about a 50% divorce rate.

866
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,720
 You know there's never been a divorce

867
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,800
 between two people pursuing Jesus?

868
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,000
 You know it's never happened in the history of the world?

869
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,520
 There has never in the history of creation

870
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,680
 been a divorce between two people

871
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,560
 who were running hard after Jesus.

872
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,920
 It's never happened.

873
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,760
 So if you just be that and you find that,

874
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,800
 you're gonna be fine.

875
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,240
 That's more than half the battle.

876
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,600
 I love what Tommy Nelson says.

877
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,720
 You probably have heard this at some point.

878
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,600
 He's just the person that I heard it from first.

879
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,640
 But it's like you're running a marathon, you know?

880
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,480
 And it's like you're serving over here

881
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,160
 and you look around and say, oh yeah,

882
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,440
 you're there serving, you're always with me.

883
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
 And then you go over to Africa or Haiti,

884
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,480
 you do a mission trip and you're in this marathon,

885
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
 you're running over there and you're like,

886
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,160
 oh yeah, it's you again, we're always together.

887
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,960
 And you're hanging out with these Christians here

888
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,560
 and you're running, you're like, oh, there we are again.

889
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,960
 You know, you're in the marathon,

890
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,400
 the person who's serving the nursery

891
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,840
 with the kids at the church, oh yeah, it's you again, huh?

892
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,400
 And you're going to church, you look over,

893
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,360
 ah, there you are.

894
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,440
 And every, you're in that marathon.

895
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,880
 And at some point, like we've been running together

896
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,720
 for a while, huh?

897
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,600
 Hey, you wanna run together forever?

898
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,440
 Awesome.

899
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,920
 And you're like, no, that's stupid.

900
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,320
 (congregation laughing)

901
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,240
 No, that's beautiful.

902
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,120
 And it happens.

903
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,840
 And when it happens, it's amazing.

904
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,040
 It really does happen.

905
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,360
 Half the battle is where you look, friends.

906
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,360
 So like, you know, people are like, oh yeah, no, we met.

907
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,360
 We met on Tinder and that's, you can, it happens.

908
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,240
 Well, we met, no, we met at the bar, we were in Uptown.

909
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,720
 It's possible.

910
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,040
 And there might be a Christian in there, it's possible.

911
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,360
 Like, I can find a Christian book in Barnes & Noble.

912
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,600
 Like, I can go to Barnes & Noble

913
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,640
 and there's a Christian section.

914
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,960
 And some of the books in that section

915
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,280
 are actually Christian, right?

916
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,120
 But if you blindfolded me and you sent me into Barnes & Noble

917
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,480
 and you said, grab a book, like, it's probably

918
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,200
 not gonna be Christian because the vast majority

919
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,000
 of books in there are not Christian.

920
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,080
 But if I go to Mardell's, you know, or Lifeway,

921
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,920
 rest in peace, if I go to a Christian bookstore,

922
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,560
 if I go to a Christian bookstore, right,

923
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,880
 and you blindfold me, you send me in there

924
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,160
 and I grab a book, there's a good chance

925
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,920
 it's gonna be a Christian because half the battle

926
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,000
 is where you look, where you're spending your time.

927
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,480
 You know what I mean?

928
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,480
 Like, that's a big part of finding someone you should marry.

929
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,120
 And I know you're looking for the one,

930
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,160
 and so I just always have to say

931
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,560
 this public service announcement, right?

932
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,280
 There's not a one, it's not one,

933
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,400
 you're not star-crossed lovers.

934
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,160
 There's somebody created about the same time you were

935
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,480
 and you guys were separated and you gotta roam

936
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,160
 throughout the earth finding this person

937
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,000
 that God in His sovereignty has identified for you

938
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,560
 and so you're really interviewing people

939
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,840
 based on how you feel to determine if they're,

940
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,160
 that comes from Greek mythology.

941
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,800
 It's the belief that Zeus, that everybody was two people

942
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,400
 and he cut them in half and he separated their halves

943
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,520
 and you have to go and find the half, find your soulmate.

944
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,080
 That it comes from pagan mythology.

945
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,380
 It's unbiblical, you're not looking for the one,

946
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,960
 you're looking for someone.

947
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,660
 You're not roaming throughout the earth

948
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,040
 trying to find the one, you're looking for someone

949
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,640
 who knows who formed the earth, okay?

950
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,080
 Like, and the good news is, right,

951
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,760
 it's not just a needle in a haystack,

952
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,120
 like it's really a group of people.

953
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,480
 It's relatively a small group of people

954
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,240
 who God has their heart.

955
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,760
 And in that group of people, there's a lot of them

956
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,320
 that you could make an amazing marriage with.

957
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,800
 Like Monica and I found each other,

958
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,160
 she's the one for me because we promised before God

959
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,280
 that we would stay together.

960
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,400
 That makes her the one.

961
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,600
 Is there someone better for her than me?

962
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,120
 Not rhetorical.

963
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,460
 Yes.

964
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,660
 She's five two, I'm six foot seven.

965
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,580
 I mean, I like guns, motorcycles, and the UFC.

966
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,860
 She doesn't like any of those things, right?

967
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,940
 But it's okay.

968
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,740
 Like, yeah, there's lots, there's probably hundreds

969
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,760
 of thousands of guys that she's more compatible with.

970
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,980
 But she's mine, I got the girl.

971
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,460
 Take that, guys.

972
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,600
 (audience laughing)

973
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,680
 Their faith will help set the pace

974
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,080
 in them living a pure life.

975
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,520
 It's a life marked by purity.

976
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,320
 And that's the fifth question.

977
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,960
 Do they set an example in purity?

978
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,240
 Do they live a pure life?

979
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,200
 Do they value pure thinking?

980
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,360
 The word there for purity, it's not just sexual purity,

981
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,380
 it's really moral cleanliness.

982
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,160
 It goes beyond physical.

983
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,800
 It's like, what are they feeding their hearts?

984
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,360
 Like, if they get most of their relationship advice

985
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,200
 from the bachelor, like, that's problematic.

986
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,400
 You know, like, if that's what they're training their heart,

987
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,500
 they're going to a university for divorce.

988
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,240
 Like, they're training themselves for divorce.

989
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,500
 So you wanna look at, like, what are they entertained by?

990
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,260
 Are they entertained by the things that Jesus died for?

991
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,400
 I think so often we're entertained and amused

992
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,440
 by the things that held Jesus on the cross.

993
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,240
 You know, are they committed to purity?

994
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,240
 Purity in the sexual sense is refraining from extramarital

995
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,120
 or especially from all sexual intercourse.

996
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,980
 And here's why that matters.

997
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,240
 Because remember, you're looking for someone

998
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,120
 who's committed to Christ.

999
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,120
 And the guy that would tell you that he loves you,

1000
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,040
 but he's moving his hand anywhere other than a ring box,

1001
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,660
 is saying something.

1002
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,880
 Let me tell you what he's saying.

1003
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,800
 Listen, lean in.

1004
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,560
 He's saying, God, I'm not scared of you.

1005
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,640
 What are you gonna do to me?

1006
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,360
 Now, listen here, God, I'm gonna do what I wanna do

1007
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,280
 when I wanna do it.

1008
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,240
 I'm gonna follow my feelings.

1009
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,040
 When I feel like having my way with someone,

1010
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,120
 that's what I'm gonna do.

1011
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,320
 I'm not afraid of you.

1012
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,520
 Proceed with caution.

1013
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,860
 You understand?

1014
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:40,380
 Proceed with caution.

1015
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,680
 Because that person is telling you something else.

1016
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,760
 And it's really important that you listen to this.

1017
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,120
 They're communicating something to you.

1018
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,240
 This is what they're saying.

1019
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,760
 They're saying, I do not value the marriage covenant.

1020
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,680
 I'm willing to go outside of the marriage covenant

1021
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,560
 for sexual intimacy.

1022
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,280
 And you need to know something.

1023
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,720
 Should we get married?

1024
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,560
 I'm telling you right now,

1025
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,680
 I'm willing to go outside the marriage covenant

1026
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,040
 for sexual intimacy.

1027
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,800
 I don't value it.

1028
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,680
 That's important.

1029
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,480
 You know, the divorce rate, or I'm sorry,

1030
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,480
 the infidelity rate of people who've been primarily impure

1031
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,800
 is astronomically higher than those who haven't.

1032
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,000
 Okay?

1033
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,940
 This is what they're communicating to you.

1034
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,760
 I don't value the marriage covenant.

1035
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,440
 I've done a lot of weddings.

1036
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,640
 I mean, I've seen the ones that work out,

1037
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,080
 the ones that don't.

1038
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,720
 You know, I've been to a lot of weddings.

1039
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,080
 I've stood up here on this stage

1040
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,640
 and looked at the thousands of you for 12 years.

1041
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,440
 You think I haven't had literally thousands

1042
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,860
 of conversations up there?

1043
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,340
 I've heard everything you can possibly imagine.

1044
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,860
 I don't say that out of arrogance,

1045
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,300
 but maybe just to earn an ounce of credibility,

1046
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,460
 to say this, sometimes when I do weddings,

1047
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,820
 every wedding you've ever been to,

1048
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,260
 there's this part, you know that part where they say,

1049
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,300
 you may kiss the bride, remember that?

1050
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,580
 You may kiss, do you know why they say that in marriages?

1051
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,100
 In weddings, rather?

1052
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,060
 You know why they say that?

1053
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,940
 Because for most of history, that was their first kiss.

1054
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,740
 You may kiss the bride.

1055
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,060
 Like, now you're married, you may kiss your bride.

1056
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,300
 And their friends and family would observe, right?

1057
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,900
 And today, that sounds crazy.

1058
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,940
 Like, it's like, you may kiss the bride.

1059
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,780
 We've seen you kiss.

1060
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,700
 We've seen you make out a thousand times, you know?

1061
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,580
 You may kiss the bride,

1062
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,420
 but I've actually done weddings of people,

1063
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,400
 that's their first kiss.

1064
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,620
 You may kiss the bride, and that's their first kiss.

1065
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,140
 Isn't that crazy?

1066
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,980
 Isn't that crazy?

1067
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,860
 You know what's crazy?

1068
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,000
 That their marriage is amazing.

1069
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,500
 That's crazy.

1070
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,060
 They have incredible marriages.

1071
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,040
 And it sounds so crazy to us,

1072
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,420
 but their hearts haven't been broken,

1073
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,420
 they haven't cried themselves to sleep.

1074
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,140
 And in that marriage covenant,

1075
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,660
 they know, hey, I've fought for purity.

1076
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,480
 You better believe I'm not going outside of this

1077
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,580
 for anybody else.

1078
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,240
 Somebody can come up to me and hit on me

1079
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,380
 and buy me a drink and say,

1080
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,580
 I can be traveling for business,

1081
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,560
 but you know I've fought for this.

1082
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,760
 And it's safe, right?

1083
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,620
 People ask how close, or how far is too far, you know?

1084
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,700
 The question, how far is too far?

1085
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,660
 And I would just say, well,

1086
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,820
 it's like asking how close to the edge can I get

1087
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,740
 of a building, like how close can I get?

1088
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,560
 I would just ask, like, do you wanna jump off?

1089
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,780
 'Cause if you wanna jump off the building,

1090
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,940
 don't get close to the edge.

1091
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,380
 I think when it comes to intimacy in relationships,

1092
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,980
 if we were honest, we all wanna jump off.

1093
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,420
 So don't get on the elevator.

1094
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,620
 But I'm gonna give you a better answer than that,

1095
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,700
 how far is too far.

1096
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,740
 Here's the answer.

1097
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,780
 When your body begins to prepare itself for sex,

1098
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,860
 you've gone too far.

1099
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,060
 When your body begins to prepare itself for sex,

1100
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,180
 you've gone too far.

1101
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,860
 And so to explain this, so you understand what I'm saying,

1102
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,420
 I'm gonna bring out a whiteboard, no, I'm kidding,

1103
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,220
 I'm not gonna do that, okay?

1104
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,380
 You know what I mean, you know what I'm saying

1105
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,100
 when I say that, when your body begins to prepare itself

1106
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,420
 for sex, you've gone too far.

1107
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,900
 And this is what the scripture says.

1108
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,400
 Flee sexual immorality.

1109
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,580
 All other sin a person commits are outside the body,

1110
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,220
 but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body,

1111
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,900
 this one's different!

1112
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,220
 He's saying that.

1113
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,620
 This sin is different.

1114
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,180
 It hurts you in a different way.

1115
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,780
 Whoever sins in sexual immorality,

1116
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,620
 sins against their own body,

1117
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,460
 do not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit

1118
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,420
 who is in you, whom you've received from God,

1119
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,340
 you are not your own, you've been bought by a price,

1120
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,580
 therefore, honor God with your body.

1121
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,900
 He's saying, hey, you know that body?

1122
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,820
 It's not your body.

1123
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,300
 You have it on loan.

1124
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,340
 You ever loan somebody something?

1125
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,700
 Like your roommate borrows your shoes or something?

1126
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,260
 You get 'em back, the heel's broken,

1127
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,100
 or your Jordan's and the bubble's popped or something,

1128
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,940
 you're like, dude, what did you do, right?

1129
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,380
 You ever loan somebody something, a dress,

1130
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,760
 then it comes back, like that's frustrating

1131
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,860
 when you give somebody something.

1132
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,740
 Monica and I had this bounce house

1133
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,020
 that we bought for the kids,

1134
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,460
 and it was more than we would normally spend,

1135
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,860
 but we just said, hey, we're gonna do this

1136
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,140
 because we're gonna lend it out freely.

1137
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,540
 Like anybody that wants to borrow the house, bounce house,

1138
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,700
 we're gonna let 'em, so it's like for birthday parties.

1139
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,820
 But when somebody would come and get the bounce house,

1140
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,820
 like I would have a list of rules

1141
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,560
 because it's my bounce house.

1142
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,900
 I would say, hey, like only three kids at a time,

1143
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,620
 make sure that it's connected to this kind of outlet,

1144
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,900
 make sure that this tube stays straight,

1145
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,740
 and make sure that you put it in the ground firmly.

1146
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,500
 And so when that person, somebody borrowed it one time

1147
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,580
 and they brought it back, it had a giant rip in it,

1148
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,540
 it was frustrating.

1149
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,620
 I forgive you, but it was frustrating, you know?

1150
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,980
 Because they used it in a way

1151
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,780
 that it wasn't intended to be used, right?

1152
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,900
 It wasn't their bounce house.

1153
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,900
 And they used it in a way that it wasn't intended to be used.

1154
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:47,420
 In summary, 1 Timothy 4:12.

1155
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:52,160
 Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young,

1156
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,620
 but set an example for believers in speech.

1157
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,540
 What do they say?

1158
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,760
 In conduct, what is their reputation?

1159
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,100
 In love, what do they love?

1160
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,940
 In faith, what do they believe?

1161
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,000
 And in purity, do they live a pure life?

1162
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,400
 My wife, she'll send me to the grocery store

1163
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,020
 every now and then, like with a list,

1164
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,240
 and she gives me this list, like milk, eggs, cheese,

1165
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,800
 whatever, and it's like, parenthetically,

1166
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,200
 she's real specific, okay?

1167
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,840
 Because she knows I'm gonna get the cheapest stuff,

1168
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,500
 like I'll come back, kill country fair all day,

1169
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,020
 like just cheapest, biggest bargain stuff I can find.

1170
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,940
 So she'll say milk, right?

1171
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,240
 But parenthetically, she'll say 2% organic,

1172
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,920
 one gallon, blue label, blue cap, this brand, you know?

1173
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,140
 And that's what it says in the parentheses, like milk,

1174
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,160
 and she's like, and don't you dare come home

1175
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,140
 without this specific kind of milk, right?

1176
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,240
 So as I'm walking through the milk aisle,

1177
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,560
 as I'm walking through the milk aisle,

1178
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,660
 I'm looking at her list, trying to find an example

1179
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,220
 that matches her description.

1180
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,060
 And when I find it, 2% organic, one gallon,

1181
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,820
 blue label, blue lid, this brand,

1182
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,200
 what I don't do is I don't open the freezer and think,

1183
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,080
 how do I feel?

1184
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,460
 (congregation laughing)

1185
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,400
 Like, do we have chemistry, me and the milk?

1186
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,400
 No, I found what I'm looking for, so I commit to it.

1187
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,260
 There's no, oh, I just know and I know,

1188
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,920
 like, hey, babe, how do I know which milk to get?

1189
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,000
 You'll just know when you know.

1190
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,880
 No, I'll know when it matches what you told me to look for.

1191
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,060
 Don't you see?

1192
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,960
 That's when you're gonna know,

1193
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,480
 that you just, you look, and you look at them,

1194
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,000
 and you're like, wait, but what about chemistry?

1195
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,040
 Isn't that important?

1196
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,240
 It has a place.

1197
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,440
 It's not ultimate.

1198
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,840
 It's not most important.

1199
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,760
 It's not first, second, third, fourth important.

1200
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,640
 Chemistry comes and goes.

1201
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,680
 I can create chemistry.

1202
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,700
 You know, you can manufacture that.

1203
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,200
 If you don't believe me, like, watch a lot of shows.

1204
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,760
 That's what they do.

1205
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,560
 Document, I mean, that's truly, that's what they do.

1206
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,420
 Great, you've had chemistry with people

1207
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,760
 that you're no longer with.

1208
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,920
 I love the resolve of my friend Marshall.

1209
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,680
 I know.

1210
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,480
 I love, I love just the pragmatism

1211
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,520
 that he approaches life with,

1212
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,120
 because he gets to this point out of college,

1213
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,960
 and he thinks, you know what?

1214
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,440
 It's time for me to get married.

1215
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,660
 And he says, so now I'm looking for a wife,

1216
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,660
 so I'm gonna go to this young adult ministry,

1217
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,040
 and I'm gonna get involved there, and I'm looking around.

1218
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,980
 And he sees somebody that when she speaks,

1219
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,760
 she builds people up,

1220
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,600
 and that her conduct is one that other girls wanna follow.

1221
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,040
 She's investing in them.

1222
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,380
 She's pouring in them.

1223
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,140
 Right?

1224
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,740
 And the way that she loves, and the things that she loves,

1225
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,300
 the way that she spends time in God's word,

1226
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,180
 the way that she's serving in that ministry,

1227
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:47,580
 it shows her heart, that she has a heart for the Lord,

1228
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:51,620
 and her faith, that Jesus is the biggest,

1229
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,580
 most important thing about her,

1230
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:58,440
 and that she is relentlessly committed to purity.

1231
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,540
 And so he goes to her, and he's like,

1232
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,480
 you match the description of what I'm looking for.

1233
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,060
 Like, he's not the most romantic guy,

1234
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,020
 I'll be honest with you.

1235
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,660
 Like, he's not singing "Boys to Men" and lighting candles.

1236
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,220
 That's just not his game, you know?

1237
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,140
 That's my game, honestly.

1238
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,140
 That's not his game.

1239
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,360
 (congregation laughing)

1240
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,580
 He's just like, you match what I'm,

1241
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,980
 like, look, do you wanna get married?

1242
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,220
 I mean, we can date a couple times if you want,

1243
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,300
 but I mean, you're what I'm looking for, right?

1244
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,100
 Dudes, I gotta talk to you before I'm done.

1245
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:28,940
 I'm done.

1246
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,580
 There's so many godly women around you,

1247
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,180
 and pornography has messed you up, man.

1248
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,940
 It's taken you, and it's trained you,

1249
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,260
 and I know it's a girl problem, too,

1250
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,060
 but it's trained you to look for all the wrong things.

1251
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:48,820
 You got five things that you're looking for.

1252
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,780
 Find someone that has those five things,

1253
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,000
 and put a ring on it.

1254
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,940
 But be those five things.

1255
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,260
 Be those five things first, okay?

1256
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,340
 Let me pray that you would.

1257
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,540
 Father, we love you.

1258
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,820
 We thank you for your word that it doesn't return void.

1259
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,300
 We thank you for just a simple verse

1260
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,820
 that gives us five things to look for

1261
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,980
 in who we should marry.

1262
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,940
 Would you press that deep into our soul?

1263
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,540
 God, I pray that there is not a divorce

1264
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,140
 that comes out of this room,

1265
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,060
 that people who are called to singleness in this room

1266
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,780
 would find contentment in it,

1267
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,740
 and people who are called to marriage

1268
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,660
 would find a suitable spouse

1269
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,900
 that sets an example in their speech

1270
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,860
 and in their conduct and in their love

1271
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,580
 and in their faith and in their purity,

1272
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,260
 and that healthy marriages would be born in this room,

1273
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,740
 and ministry would be strengthened

1274
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:43,180
 because we're really just looking for a partner in ministry,

1275
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,220
 that that's what would happen,

1276
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,820
 that we would meet somebody

1277
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,660
 that we can make disciples with and get after it.

1278
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,920
 Help us not to learn from Hollywood, God.

1279
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,380
 We know that Hollywood has the highest divorce rate

1280
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,140
 of anywhere in America,

1281
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,020
 and they should not be the ones instructing us

1282
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,540
 on what to look for in a spouse.

1283
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,260
 You should, God, we wanna listen to you.

1284
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,180
 We wanna learn from you.

1285
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,940
 Help us to unlearn what we need to unlearn.

1286
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,980
 And Father, would you make us new, give us new hearts,

1287
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,100
 help us to learn what we need to learn.

1288
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,060
 In the name of Jesus, I pray.

1289
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,400
 (whooshing)
