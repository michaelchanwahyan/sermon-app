[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:27.000]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.680]   New series kicking off tonight.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.480]   Welcome friends in the room and in Fort Worth
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.600]   and El Paso and Houston.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.400]   Fort Worth, last night in the Rizley Theater.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.780]   Get excited in Tulsa and Woodlands and Spring
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.360]   and Cedar Rapids, wherever you're joining us from.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.320]   We're glad that you're listening.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.200]   We are kicking off a new series tonight
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.000]   on Lyrics and Lies, Anthem Edition.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.980]   What is anthems?
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.200]   It's basically, we're gonna look at different songs
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.120]   that were an anthem to the last 10 to 15 years.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.640]   They kind of marked an era, marked an age
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.500]   and were songs that we all know the beat to.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.200]   They were your old ringtone when you were in high school.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.520]   They may have been a song that came out
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.920]   when you were in junior high or college,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.240]   but they're songs that over the last 10 years
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.000]   have just kind of been at the forefront.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.480]   These were big, big hits.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.640]   And we're gonna cover a different topic each night
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.560]   and a few songs that connect to that.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.480]   Let me start this way with a little bit of a story
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.320]   to get us into.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.720]   The other day I was leaving,
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.840]   I've got a two and a half year old son
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.000]   and I was leaving to go to work.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.080]   I came up to him, give him a hug.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.880]   Hey, daddy's going to work, I'll see you soon.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.320]   And he began singing,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.820]   ♪ Grownups come back ♪
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.420]   And I'm like, what are you guys doing here while I'm gone?
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.180]   What is mom teaching you?
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.540]   And then a couple of days go by later
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.860]   and he sings another song.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.220]   He's like, I have to go potty.
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.820]   And he says, when you have to go potty,
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.900]   stop and go right away.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.900]   And I'm like, what is your mother teaching you?
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.580]   And then it happened another time
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.660]   where he was like upset about something
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.140]   and he was like, when you feel so mad that you want to roar,
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.700]   take a deep breath and count to four.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.760]   It's like, man, this is Eminem.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.900]   We are raising a prodigy right here.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.360]   But what had happened was
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.580]   he had been watching a TV show called Daniel Tiger.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.480]   Oh my gosh, I got some big Daniel Tiger fans in the room.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.280]   Wow, that's curve ball.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.660]   Which is this the show that I'm not even gonna go into,
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.960]   but point being on the show,
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.900]   they have like little songs that they'll teach
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.040]   and have the kids sing as they watch
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.960]   and in order to teach and instruct their behavior.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.600]   It's pretty genius when you think about it
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.880]   'cause in listening to it, it's instructing how they act
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.200]   and it's influencing how he behaves
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.880]   and how he thinks about the world
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.600]   and even sees the world around him that,
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   hey, grownups leave, but they come back.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.540]   You gotta go to the bathroom, you gotta go and on and on.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.040]   And I start there because in a similar way,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.000]   this is really something we never grow out of.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.560]   That the songs we listen to, the things that we watch
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080]   and specifically for this series,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.800]   the things that we're listening to
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.400]   influence the way that we think about the world around us.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.720]   They influence the way that we see,
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.880]   the way that we behave oftentimes
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.520]   and they have an influence over how we see ourselves,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.120]   what we think is valuable,
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.400]   where we think fun is to be had
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.920]   and just kind of how we see and perceive
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.660]   and behave inside of the world to varying degrees.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.080]   And so we're gonna tackle in this series,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.620]   different songs that have shaped
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.660]   really the last kind of 10 to 15 years
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.360]   and have shaped us and shaped parts
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.980]   of the way that we think about the world
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.500]   and attack some of the lies that are contained
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.880]   within the songs that are there.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.500]   There's no question music is powerful.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.500]   Abraham Lincoln had a quote where he said,
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.900]   I'll read it so don't butcher it.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.780]   "Whoever writes the nation's songs shapes the nation's soul."
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.780]   I mean, how powerful is that?
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.620]   And you're thinking like,
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.100]   Abe, what were you guys listening to back then?
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.420]   I mean, for real.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.620]   But even then he's going, hey, the power of music
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.820]   and the power to write the songs that people are singing
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.380]   is gonna be a power that's gonna get implanted
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.300]   into people's heads.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.200]   I mean, think about how many songs,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.660]   how many song lyrics you have memorized
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.860]   and how many more you have memorized
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.140]   than all the scriptures.
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.460]   If you put together, you have memorized, it's crazy.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.520]   And so we're gonna look at specifically certain lies
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.760]   over the next four weeks together.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   Tonight, we're gonna look at a couple of lies
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.940]   that are embedded over and over and over again
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.900]   and have been over and over embedded
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.340]   into different songs in the last 10 years.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.740]   And so let me just play a few of them
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.820]   that'll give us a little framework.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.460]   Here's what's embedded inside of all those songs.
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.940]   And it sounds silly, but it's this idea that,
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.980]   hey, you're perfect just the way you are.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.740]   You do you, anyone who tells you you need to change
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.520]   or be anything different, they're just haters.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.020]   Brush them off, you do you,
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.220]   you're perfect just the way that you are.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.700]   And it's a message that is at the forefront,
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.740]   really, of so much of our culture.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.500]   And it may be one of the most dangerous lies
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.820]   that if you're a Christian, you can believe,
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.220]   maybe if you're in general a person that you can believe.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.780]   And I understand that a lot of the reason
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.140]   why Selena's singing it is she's trying to encourage
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.100]   the self-esteem of 13-year-old girls.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.980]   But if you take that idea that, man, you're perfect
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.520]   just the way you are, you were born perfect,
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.500]   you don't need to change, other people need to change,
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.340]   don't listen to them.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.220]   If you take that and you transfer it,
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.020]   not just to your external appearance
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.100]   as you go through puberty,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.340]   but into the way that you think about life,
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.340]   into the way that you think about, man, the perfect,
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.780]   or I was made perfect, my desires,
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.780]   everything about me is perfect,
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.540]   you are going to forfeit everything
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.500]   God wants to do in your life.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.620]   And it's gonna have implications,
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.580]   it's gonna cost you as a person in terms of growth,
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.900]   it's gonna cost you everything that the Bible says
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.540]   God wants to do for the rest of your life
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.380]   in and through you.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.260]   And so we're gonna explore three lies and three truths,
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.060]   three lies from these songs, a number of them,
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.180]   and then three truths from God's word
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.140]   that this may be the message
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.700]   that most in our culture right now people are believing,
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.980]   that, hey, just the way you are is perfect,
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.380]   don't let anyone tell you something other.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.260]   That you're really a good person at the end of the day
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.540]   who has it together and you don't need to worry
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.700]   about changing, let the world change around you,
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.020]   and we're gonna see it is just not true.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.260]   So we're gonna explore three truths,
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.100]   we're gonna jump around,
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.940]   this series will be a topical look
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.900]   at some things in culture,
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.620]   and then we just take what does God's word say
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.840]   in response to some of these embedded lies
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.940]   that are inside of there.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.260]   The most dangerous thing about this lie tonight,
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.900]   that, hey, you're so loved, you're perfect,
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.780]   you're beautiful just the way you are,
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.740]   is it may be one of the more dangerous lies
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.620]   because it's a distorted version.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.620]   In other words, each one of these things that I'm saying,
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.900]   you're perfect, you're loved,
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.720]   you just need to embrace who you are,
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.980]   it's such a dangerous lie
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.940]   because it's not like some huge out there,
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.500]   like, hey, you're an alien, that's not what it is,
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.900]   it's like a distorted, just twisted version of the truth,
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.180]   which is how Satan works best.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.100]   He's not gonna come with some huge out there crazy lies,
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.140]   he's just gonna take the truth and twist it just slightly,
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.780]   and that's what he's doing here.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.180]   And so we're gonna look through these three lies
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.340]   and three truths that correspond to each one of them,
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.300]   and I'll just kick it off right here.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.280]   The first one is the lie that we've already said
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.260]   or alluded to, that you are perfect.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.460]   But Pink in her song says,
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.620]   "Pretty please don't ever feel you're less than perfect."
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.140]   As Christina already said, you're beautiful in every way,
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.180]   words can't bring you down, you're so beautiful
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.260]   no matter what anyone says.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.980]   Or as Selena said, "Who says you're not perfect?
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.860]   "Who says you're not perfect?"
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.180]   I don't know who's believing this, honestly.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.660]   Like, I think, I don't know who's writing these songs
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.100]   and being like, yeah, tell 'em they're perfect.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.660]   Who actually believes that at the end of the day?
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.300]   I think most of us are at least familiar enough
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.220]   to be like, yeah, that's positive, I wanna believe it,
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.300]   but if this is perfection, oh, we're in trouble.
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.220]   I mean, it's just a, it's a blatant lie.
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.160]   The truth from God's word, as simple as that sounds,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.000]   is that you're broken, and so am I,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.020]   and so is every person who's ever lived, who's out there,
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.660]   that you're broken.
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.420]   And in attempting to build up self-esteem,
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.340]   they just overcorrect and just tell 'em that they're perfect.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.940]   And if you embrace that, you embrace it the way that,
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.900]   the desires you have, the personality you have,
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.980]   who you are is perfect, and others need to conform to you.
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.660]   You are just looking for that perfect someone in your world
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.060]   who's gonna perfectly compliment your perfection.
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.980]   You are gonna be looking for a unicorn,
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.260]   as it relates to a spouse,
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.420]   and you are going to fail to grow in any way.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.660]   The first lie is that you're perfect,
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.300]   and the truth from God's word is that you are broken,
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.140]   and so am I.
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.580]   The Bible says this in Psalm 51, verses four through five,
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.620]   where it says you're broken because of sin, you're sinful.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.400]   David says, "Surely I was sinful at birth,"
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.380]   like from my birth, I've been covered in sin.
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.880]   "Sinful from the time that my mother conceived me,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.680]   "that I'm not just a basically good person.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.940]   "I am a sinner, my parents were sinners.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.540]   "I come into this world with a sin nature
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.720]   "that taints everything inside of my life."
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.640]   I mean, even the fact that, I think logically,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.960]   you gotta think that even the singers of these songs
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.320]   don't believe this.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.400]   They're just putting it out there.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.800]   I mean, 'cause no one would say,
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.240]   or I'm sure none of them would say,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.120]   "Yes, I'm universally speaking to everyone,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.960]   "everywhere, always.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.460]   "They're perfect just the way they are.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.160]   "ISIS, you do you.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   "And sex slavery traders, you do you."
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.140]   And we'd all just say, "Ah, yeah, that doesn't really apply
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.880]   "to you, not perfect in that direction."
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.940]   There's places where we'd all agree it just breaks down.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.600]   You know, there's an association called NAMLA,
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.320]   which you may have heard us talk about before,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.200]   National Association of Man-Boy Love,
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.040]   which is a group that advocates for,
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.380]   hey, people are pedophiles too,
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.960]   and wants to advocate for pedophilia
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.160]   being something people were born with,
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.040]   and that's okay and it should be embraced.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.160]   They're perfect the way they are.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.440]   That is a lie.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.960]   And I think all of us, even the singers of these songs,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.260]   would address and believe that,
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.900]   that someone, some people out there may not be perfect.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.100]   And the Bible over and over again teaches
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.040]   the reason you are not perfect,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.420]   the reason you're broken, is because of sin.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.720]   That sin came into the world,
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.640]   and when Adam sinned, it's like he caught the infection,
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.520]   and everything inside of him was contaminated,
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.000]   and every descendant that he would ever have,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.240]   Adam being Adam and Eve,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.120]   are the original beginning of creation,
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.640]   and the original parents, if you will,
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.420]   of all of human race.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.640]   When Adam sinned, he introduced sin into all of the world,
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.660]   and all of a sudden, all of his descendants
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.560]   caught the disease.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.760]   All of them were contaminated.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.360]   In Romans chapter five, verses 12, it says this,
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.840]   that Adam, just as sin entered the world through one man,
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.340]   and death through sin, in the same way,
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.740]   death came to all people because all sinned.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.140]   Basically, the Bible teaches that, hey, in Adam,
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:45.160]   all of us, when Adam sinned, all of his DNA,
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.680]   all of a sudden, was tainted and contaminated with sin,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.360]   and for all of human history,
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.120]   every child of Adam, son of Adam or daughter of Eve,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.180]   has been infected with the disease that's around you.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.840]   The Bible says this is a sin nature.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.960]   What is a sin nature?
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.740]   Sin nature means sinning comes naturally.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.480]   And I always feel like this kind of goes without saying,
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.280]   but just in case it doesn't, I mean, think about it.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.800]   Think about how easy it is,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.100]   or the fact that sinning does come naturally.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.940]   Like, none of us came in here
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.400]   and had to work at being selfish.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.900]   Like, if I'm honest, I'm really good at loving me.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.240]   I love me some me, and I'm great at loving me,
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.140]   and my guess is, in neutral, so are you.
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.320]   Nobody in here had to work at their lust problem,
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.200]   like, you know what, I'm really,
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.440]   this year has been my year.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.600]   I'm doing paleo, and I'm working on lust,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.520]   increasing my lust.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.960]   No one has that problem.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.900]   Greed is not something you have to attempt to do.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.040]   It's something that just can grab ahold of you.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.360]   Jealousy.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.480]   No one is trying, oh man, I'm just not a jealous person,
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.520]   and I'm trying to be more jealous.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.000]   Gosh, I just can't do it.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.280]   It just grabs us.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.160]   It comes naturally.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.880]   The Bible is just saying what we've all seen,
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.780]   we've all experienced, is that you are not perfect,
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.720]   and you're a broken person, just like me,
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.640]   because sin has come in and contaminated
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.740]   everything inside of us.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.920]   Now, here's where the distortion comes in,
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.680]   because you may be thinking, doesn't the Bible say,
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.000]   I'm fearfully and wonderfully made?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.600]   Like, God made me?
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.240]   I'm fearfully and perfectly made,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.320]   and he wove me together in my mother's womb,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.800]   Psalm 139 says?
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.700]   Yes.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.280]   But when the infection of sin was introduced
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.080]   into the human race, everything got tainted.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:30.080]   So your personality, your desires, your will,
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.600]   your mind, all of it, the Bible teaches,
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.840]   was contaminated by sin.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.980]   Now, there's things that can restrain us,
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.780]   and the Spirit of God can allow us to find victory
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.300]   over those things, but all of us
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.040]   have been totally contaminated,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.960]   and everything that sin has touched is contaminated.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.800]   It's a little bit like this.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.000]   This is gonna be a weird illustration,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.420]   but just go with me here for a second.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.560]   Let's say we're hanging out this Saturday,
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.240]   you come over, hanging at my house,
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.600]   and we're getting together, and I'm like,
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.760]   oh yeah, I'm gonna make some punch,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.240]   we're hanging in the backyard, it's going great,
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.080]   we're grilling.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.700]   All of a sudden, you go and you go to drink some punch,
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.080]   and I'm like, hey, just wanna give you a heads up.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.440]   I had the punch on the ground, my dog came over,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.360]   peed in the punch.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.360]   So just, you do you, and here's what I'm confident,
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.880]   I know, this is so, just go with me.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.360]   Here's what I'm confident your next question would not be.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.840]   Well, how much pee?
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.320]   How much?
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.240]   It would be, okay, I'm gonna pass,
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.940]   hard pass on the punch, I'm okay.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.280]   Because any contamination, it's ruined.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.240]   The punch is done.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.200]   (laughing)
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.920]   That's such a weird illustration.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.320]   And the Bible says that in the same way,
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.700]   when sin touched humanity, and when sin,
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.980]   which is a part of your life, by choice and by birth,
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.520]   you're born with a sin nature, and you choose to sin,
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.640]   and in doing so, when sin touched the human race,
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.360]   it contaminated everything.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.840]   And there's varying degrees to how much sin
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.320]   has been a part of your life, but according to the Bible,
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.560]   you are broken.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.220]   And sin has come in and contaminated
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.820]   everything that it's touched.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.520]   Everything that it's touched.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.160]   The first point is that you're not perfect, you are broken.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.820]   And if you're gonna experience healing
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.280]   from any brokenness or growth in your life,
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.920]   you will have to come to the place where you realize,
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.520]   I am broken, which means the solution
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.680]   for my brokenness doesn't come from me.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.440]   I don't know if you're a Christian,
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.660]   really, whatever you believe,
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.080]   if you come to the place where you realize,
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.140]   man, I really do have a sin nature,
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.320]   there's something broken in me, what is that?
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.840]   If you're gonna experience healing
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.840]   in realizing you're broken, you're taking that first step,
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.280]   because you are also realizing,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.600]   which means the solution to my brokenness
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.360]   doesn't come from in me.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.880]   The second lie that we see from these songs
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.680]   that we're covering tonight is the lie that,
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.320]   hey, because you are loved, you do not need to change.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.740]   You just need to accept yourself, love yourself, and move on.
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.120]   Lady Gaga said it this way, she says,
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.120]   that there's nothing wrong with loving who you are,
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.240]   'cause he, God, made you perfect.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.800]   So hold your head up, girl, you'll go far.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.420]   Listen to me when I say, I'm beautiful in my way,
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.000]   God makes no mistakes, I'm on the right track, baby,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.720]   I was born this way, don't hide yourself in regret,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.220]   just love yourself and you're set.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.160]   I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.920]   The lie again, hey, you're loved,
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.720]   just love yourself and you'll be set.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.360]   Who you are, you do you,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.840]   that's all that you need to worry about.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.200]   You don't need to change, you're loved just as you are.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:36.120]   And the Bible says, the Christian message is
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.880]   that because you are loved, Christ wants to change you.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.160]   That because Christ loves you, he wants to change you,
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.560]   and he will change you if you put your faith
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.620]   and trust in him, he'll begin to chip away at your life
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.380]   and begin to change your life,
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.180]   day by day, moment by moment.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.880]   That's what Christianity teaches,
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.120]   that God does love you just the way you are.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.600]   He loves you too much, though, to leave you that way.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.780]   This is what the Bible teaches,
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.540]   that God loves you just exactly like you walked in here,
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.260]   right now, wherever you're at in this room,
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.020]   whatever your spiritual journey is,
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.380]   whatever sin struggle you're having, dominate your life.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.280]   Whatever your past is, whatever you've done,
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.660]   God is crazy in love with you.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.640]   And he loves you so much that he doesn't just accept you,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.000]   he accepts you and loves you enough
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.560]   to not accept you not changing,
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.200]   that he's gonna come in and because he loves,
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   begin to change and transform your life.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.720]   That's what the Christian life is.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.640]   It's not static, it's not, hey, I put my faith on the shelf
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.240]   and it's just, you know, I keep working,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.600]   working, church at church.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.660]   It is a constant growing to meet more like Jesus.
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.180]   The Bible says in Romans 8, verses 28 and 29,
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.100]   this, that we know in all things,
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.300]   God works for the good of those who love him,
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.860]   who've been called according to his purpose.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.960]   He's talking about Christians.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.460]   And here's the good that God works about.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.380]   For those who God foreknew, he predestined to be conformed
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:08.220]   or to be transformed into the image of his son,
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.880]   that he might be the firstborn
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.320]   among many brothers and sisters.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.960]   So the Bible teaches is that because God loves you,
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.360]   he's gonna come into your life
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.320]   and begin to transform anything inside of your life
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.780]   that does not look like Jesus.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.520]   There is a, I don't know if you're familiar
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.760]   with the statue of David.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.240]   It was by Michelangelo and there we go.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.340]   There's the PG version, folks.
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.880]   When Michelangelo constructed this,
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.320]   which was a few hundred years ago, it's amazing structure.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.040]   It's one of just the things that people travel
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.760]   all over the world to construct.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.300]   And Michelangelo was asked one day, how did you make it?
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.540]   How did you construct or how did you chisel out
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.040]   this incredible thing from a single block of marble?
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.280]   And he said, it was easy.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.400]   I just chiseled away everything that didn't look like David.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.600]   That's what the Bible teaches God is doing in your life.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.440]   That for the rest of your life, if you're a Christian,
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.660]   he loves you too much to leave you that way.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.180]   And he's gonna chisel every single part of your life
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.940]   that is not consistent with his son because he loves you.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.060]   And it would be unloving to stop at anything short.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.960]   I have, like I mentioned earlier, a son
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.820]   and we recently went to the doctor and the doctor said,
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.560]   hey, there's a couple things you guys as parents
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.760]   need to make sure change in your son
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.640]   before his three year old birthday.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.520]   And she said, you gotta get the whole potty training thing
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.520]   down and the middle of the night wake ups and the pacifier.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.360]   I know this is exciting stuff, welcome to my world.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.780]   What's the middle of the night wake ups?
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.880]   We're at this stage where he's like, he's gonna come
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.120]   at either 2 a.m., 3 a.m., I'll be awake, just FYI.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.600]   He's gonna come into our room.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.720]   I won't be awake naturally, but he's gonna come in,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.360]   wake me up and then it's a game of like whatever
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.540]   I have to tell you in order to get to stay up
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.380]   for a little bit.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.900]   So it's like, hey, I'm thirsty right now.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.460]   Or I drank too much water or he'll come in and be like,
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.600]   I need to put socks on or he'll come in again
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.520]   and be like, I need to take my socks off.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.280]   But the best one true story, this kid is gonna be a lawyer.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.040]   He came in and was like, I need to change my socks.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.660]   These socks have been on for too long.
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.180]   And he's just like, oh my gosh, this is terrible.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.800]   And then the potty training thing goes without saying,
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.680]   pacifier thing.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.240]   Here's what would be unloving.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.000]   If we turn to that doctor and we said, look,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.940]   we are not changing him.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.660]   Are you kidding me?
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.420]   That would be so unloving.
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.420]   We're gonna let him do him.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.940]   Okay, if he wants to wear a diaper when he's in high school,
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.980]   that's great.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.660]   Pacifier, we're cool with it.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.900]   If he marries some girl someday and wakes her up at two
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.420]   and is like, can you change my socks?
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.520]   We're great with that.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.180]   Because we love our child.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.280]   You would be like, you guys are lunatics.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.640]   You are cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.780]   What is wrong with you?
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.540]   That's not loving to a child.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.720]   That's what God in the Bible teaches over and over.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.240]   God is doing his, he's a part of bringing change
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.500]   in your life and in my life.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.320]   Not because he doesn't love you,
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.240]   but precisely exactly 'cause he's crazy about you
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.720]   and he loves you.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.640]   He wants to see you become all that you can be.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.320]   And he knows that all that your potential to be
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.800]   is connected to you becoming more and more like Christ.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.240]   More free from sin.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.200]   More and more to look like Jesus.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.500]   And so a lot of times people will say things like,
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.540]   man, that's just the way that I am.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.080]   I'm a short-tempered kind of guy.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.660]   Jesus wants to change that.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.740]   People say, man, it's just the way that I am.
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.140]   Like, you know, I kind of like my me time,
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.060]   my I'm alone time.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.560]   Anything in your life that doesn't look like Jesus,
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.500]   he's gonna change.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.940]   People will say things like, I'm not quick to trust
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.620]   or I kind of hold a grudge.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.900]   Everything in your life that doesn't look like Jesus,
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:05.300]   the spirit of God wants to kill and change.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.180]   And that's what he's gonna do.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.780]   And in eternity, fully and finally,
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.940]   but from now until then,
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.500]   that's what the spirit of God is at work,
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.740]   convicting and bringing about to chisel away
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.860]   every part of you that doesn't look like Jesus.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.660]   That's what the message of Christianity is.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.820]   Not because you're loved, you don't need to change.
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.660]   Because God loves you, he will bring about change
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.140]   and wants to bring about change
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.620]   inside of your life, inside of me.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.340]   And then finally, third point,
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:37.500]   comes from a song that was written by Macklemore,
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.600]   the rapper, that same love that I can't change,
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.160]   even if I tried, even if I wanted to, I can't change.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.100]   Now, I don't wanna go into, when this song came out,
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.020]   it was clearly connected to another message
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:57.300]   that, you know, in case you were under a rock in 2015
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.740]   or underground, it was connected
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:03.740]   to the homosexual movement, and it's clearly about that.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.780]   What I'm connecting to in this song
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.060]   is a message that's repeated here,
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.100]   repeated over and over again,
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.420]   that, hey, you can't change, you shouldn't try,
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.660]   you should just embrace and accept who you are.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.720]   And it's a lie.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.460]   The idea that change is impossible is a lie.
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.760]   Where he gets it right is the truth is,
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.740]   as Christians, we believe you can't change, that's right.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.840]   But Christ can change you is the truth.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.980]   That you can't change on your own,
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.420]   but Christ can come in and will come in
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.180]   to all who allow him and accept him as Lord and Savior,
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.380]   and he will begin to bring about change
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.640]   inside of your life and inside of my life.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.540]   There's really three ways that the Bible says
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.940]   he brings about change inside of our life,
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.620]   so I just wanna talk about that quickly
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.380]   and then show an example of the ways
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.700]   that God brings about change, and then close,
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:56.600]   and we'll be done from there.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.180]   But there's three ways, if you wanna experience change,
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.660]   if you're going to change,
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.980]   if you're gonna experience change in your life,
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.380]   it's gonna involve these three criteria,
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.100]   or these three things that over and over again,
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.940]   God says, this is the means by which I transform people.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.540]   If you wanna experience, if you have an eating disorder,
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.060]   if you're addicted to pornography,
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.020]   if you have an addiction to alcohol,
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.580]   or maybe you're just, you're covered in anxiety
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.540]   all the time, or jealousy, or you're codependent,
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.960]   in every relationship you get in, you're codependent.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.560]   You don't have to stay that way.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.660]   And the God who's there promises that if you will come to him
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.900]   and allow him to work, and allow specifically,
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.420]   follow him in these three ways, you will experience freedom.
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.460]   This is the method by which God changes
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.360]   and transforms people.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.220]   People say, I got family members that are like,
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.700]   you know, people don't really change.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.680]   People change.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.980]   I don't know who you're hanging out with
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.300]   if you're like, oh, people don't change.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.780]   Apparently, your friends don't change.
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.420]   I work around people all the time
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.780]   that have been radically changed.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.680]   I mean, I was going around with our team today,
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.680]   just in our team time, and we got everything from like,
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.080]   hey, I was divorced, I was addicted,
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   I was overwhelmed in anxiety, I was an alcoholic,
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.000]   everything in between, and these people,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.580]   it's like, man, I would've thought you grew up
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.160]   on a seminary or something, or like,
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   you were just, you spent your whole life in church
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.340]   'cause God has radically transformed your life.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.840]   I mean, our main worship leaders,
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.080]   Shane was leading worship.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.880]   I was thinking about John, who leads on Sunday.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.500]   The dude was in a gang for like the first 20 years,
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.120]   or when he was 20 years old, he was in a gang.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.120]   I look at that, and I'm like, dude, how is that possible?
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.620]   John, you're like the nicest, most meek guy of all time.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.740]   It's hard to think of you being in a gang together,
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.780]   and he's like, I was, man, it was thug life.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.400]   And it's crazy.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.460]   God brings about change, and so let me tell you how
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.620]   he's bringing about change in my life, our team's life,
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.260]   anyone who's experiencing change through him
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.780]   is experiencing it these three ways.
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.340]   The first is by living out God's word.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.300]   Not by reading God's word, not by having a quiet time,
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.340]   not by attending the porch on Tuesday nights,
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.180]   by living out what the Bible says.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.800]   Here's what James, the brother of Jesus says
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.840]   in James chapter one, verses 22.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:08.720]   "Do not merely listen to the word or the Bible,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.900]   "and so deceive yourselves."
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.880]   To us, he would say, do not merely listen or read.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.540]   At that time, they didn't have Bibles.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.220]   They just had some of the letters.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.260]   So he's saying, hey, don't listen,
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.740]   don't show up and listen, don't just show up and read it.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.380]   And so deceive yourselves.
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.820]   Do what it says.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.280]   Anyone who listens to the word,
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.140]   but does not do what it says,
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.780]   is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror,
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.320]   and after looking at himself in the mirror,
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.460]   goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.000]   But whoever looks intently into the perfect law
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.460]   that gives freedom and continues in it,
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:46.060]   is doing it, not forgetting what they heard, but doing it,
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.440]   they will be blessed in everything that they do.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.700]   James says, hey, don't be people who,
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.500]   if you just show up on Tuesday nights,
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.540]   you're gonna get good vibes,
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.840]   hopefully you'll be encouraged,
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.820]   but it will not be enough to allow you
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.480]   to experience change in your life.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.620]   You have to be someone who doesn't just read the Bible,
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.500]   they apply the Bible every single day.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.540]   Here's something, let me just say
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.140]   the most provocative way I can put this.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.980]   The Bible doesn't change people's lives.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.500]   It doesn't.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.060]   Applying the Bible changes people's lives.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.500]   The Bible doesn't change people's lives
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.020]   any more than looking into a mirror
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.220]   changes the way that you look.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.440]   You look into a mirror and you're like,
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.360]   oh, whoa, curve ball, I need to change that,
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.640]   or man, I woke up like this and it was not pretty.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.520]   And that's what you do when you look into a mirror.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.680]   But the mirror doesn't like shave your face.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.120]   The mirror doesn't apply mascara,
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.140]   the mirror just tells you, whoa.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.440]   That's what a mirror does.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.200]   I'm like, showing you what I think
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.720]   when I look in the mirror, like, whoa.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.720]   Anyways, let's keep going.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.720]   In the same way, the Bible doesn't change people's lives.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.100]   Doing what the Bible says changes people's lives.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:56.660]   If you're gonna experience being changed
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.660]   or transformed for Christ, it will involve you
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.020]   not just reading, but applying God's word into your life.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.300]   The second is not just living out God's word,
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.580]   it's living in community with God's people.
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.980]   Hebrews chapter three, verses 12 and 13 say this.
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.200]   See that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.040]   that turns away from the living God.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.440]   So be careful, watch out, that none of you
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.600]   has a heart that would turn away.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.000]   And then he says, how do you make sure
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.400]   that you're careful and not have your heart
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.440]   turn away from God?
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.740]   Here's the remedy.
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:32.100]   But encourage one another daily,
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.420]   as long as it's called today,
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.880]   so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.840]   or by sin's deceitfulness.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.660]   That the antidote, the Bible says,
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.040]   for you having a heart that doesn't turn away,
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.340]   for your faith staying strong, continuing to grow,
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.620]   for you to experience change in your life,
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.260]   for you to conquer addiction,
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.620]   for you to get over and to grow
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.360]   into all that God has for you,
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:01.620]   for you to experience freedom and meaning and just life,
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.160]   like not a sense of emptiness,
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.100]   you will have to be connected to other believers
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.380]   in a real way.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.020]   Like you're gonna have to be in a small group
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.820]   or at your church, whatever they call them,
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.620]   life groups, home groups, Sunday Bible study,
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.080]   I don't know what, if you don't attend here, they're called,
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.140]   but you've gotta have real authentic relationships
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.980]   in your life with other believers
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.780]   who know where you need to be encouraged daily,
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.040]   who you can come along and do what James 5, 16 says,
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.140]   confess your sins to one another
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.520]   so that you would be healed.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.220]   If you don't have those people,
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.780]   you're not gonna experience change.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.220]   And you are forfeiting one of the primary ways
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.060]   God says he's gonna speak to you and protect you.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.380]   I mean, this is like, I hope you know,
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.640]   this is like so real to not just, you know,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.020]   the broader group, this is real to me,
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.180]   it's real to our staff,
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.460]   we're all a part of small groups and groups with people
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.580]   that know where we're struggling,
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.820]   know where we need to be prayed for.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.880]   Recently in the past few weeks,
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.540]   I entered into another group called ReGen,
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.440]   where I'm just going, God, there's areas of my heart I hate,
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.660]   I'm prideful.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.580]   And I think that I'm better than people.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.160]   I think that I know better, candidly,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.540]   I'm always like, yeah, that's dumb.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.780]   And I think that I know better and I hate it.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.700]   And I don't wanna live the rest of my life
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.740]   allowing pride to hurt my relationships,
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.540]   to hinder growing into the person,
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.460]   I have control problems and anger problems.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.040]   And I don't wanna allow those things that impact my life.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.620]   I wanna take ground and the good news is,
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.260]   I know that there's a God who changes people.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.060]   I've seen him change in my own life.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.860]   And he's a God that when you and I begin to apply
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.040]   these things, brings about change inside of your life,
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.020]   there is hope.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.220]   You do not have to stay the way that you are.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.780]   And the spirit of God doesn't want you
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.500]   to stay the way that you are.
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:58.200]   But you will, if you're not living in community,
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.340]   if other people are not aware of the areas
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.940]   where you are tempted, where you are giving in to sin,
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.060]   where other people are not coming along you regularly,
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.260]   not like I call this guy on the phone every now and then,
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.220]   then I call her and we talk every now and then,
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.420]   we're accountability and they say they pray.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.960]   Daily, it says, they are in your life.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.100]   And if you do not have that, you are missing out
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.980]   on one of the key ways that God brings change.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.380]   If you are dating and the person you're dating
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.460]   doesn't have that, you should be scared.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.180]   I don't know how more lovingly to put it.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.780]   You should be afraid.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.580]   And you should tell that person, you need community
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.620]   because you are dating someone who the Bible says is a fool.
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.860]   Proverbs 18, one says, whoever isolates himself,
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.460]   quarrels or fights against sound wisdom.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.460]   What do you call someone who fights against sound wisdom?
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.580]   A fool.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.100]   And it says, they seek their own desires.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.140]   They do what, you know, they think at the end of the day,
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.900]   hey, I prayed about it, this is what I think I should do.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.380]   And the Bible says that person living in isolation
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.320]   is a fool.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.260]   Am I saying you should break up?
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.980]   I don't know, I'm saying that you're dating someone
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:12.380]   who's living foolishly and you should be scared
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.300]   or you should at least bring the conversation up
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.860]   and be like, hey girl, I'm gonna make sure
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.020]   you're not seven times as crazy.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.660]   Do you have community?
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.480]   Or hey guy, what's the deal?
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.140]   Are there guys in your life that know what's going on?
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.780]   Number three, so living out God's word,
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.500]   living in community with God's people.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.620]   And then the third one is living in dependence
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.540]   on God's spirit.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:37.780]   The Bible says that the Christian life is a constant mode.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.820]   I'm just dependent on you one day at a time,
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.860]   one day at a time.
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.660]   What does it look like to live dependent on God's spirit?
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.900]   This one honestly, I think is the hardest one
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.500]   to try to communicate.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.420]   I think it's a constant communication and prayer
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.320]   of God, will you help me right now?
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.160]   Will you help me?
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.180]   I'm gonna walk into this room,
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.420]   I'm gonna be tempted to be concerned
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.280]   about what everyone else thinks about me.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.580]   God, will you help me right now?
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.940]   As I just get overwhelmed thinking about the future
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.020]   and I need your help.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.540]   I'm constantly inviting you.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.980]   I'm constantly trying to be sensitive
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.220]   to when the Lord I feel like is kind of pricking,
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.300]   like hey, I want you to speak up right now
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.940]   and be sensitive to his leading.
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.900]   I think it involves being dependent on the spirit
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.900]   is a constant prayer communication
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.940]   and an awareness of God's presence
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.180]   and sovereignty in your life.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.420]   Those are big words.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.140]   They may not mean as clear,
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.120]   but I think that's honestly one of the best way
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.280]   that I know how to put it is it is a constant,
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.280]   I'm just constantly aware,
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.840]   I'm constantly communicating with you God.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.000]   Will you help me Lord?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.400]   I'm dependent on you.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.000]   If this is on my strength, I'm not gonna make it.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.760]   Lord, will you help me?
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.560]   And that posture of I'm dependent on you
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.440]   and then just an awareness that hey,
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.740]   God, you're at work, you're around me,
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.840]   you're in control,
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.200]   that I'm constantly dependent on you.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.960]   You know what just happened.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.460]   You're not surprised by these events
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.920]   and so I'm gonna trust you.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.140]   Will you help me that you live,
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.160]   living out God's word,
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.200]   living in community with God's people
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.360]   and living in constant dependence on the spirit of God.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.560]   I think it's such a tragedy
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:16.080]   that so many people put their faith on the shelf
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.000]   and they don't experience change.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.280]   I mean, how many people over the age of 35 do you know
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.320]   that like, oh yeah, hey, I'm a Christian,
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.840]   that's important to me,
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.320]   but it doesn't impact anything about their life.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.160]   Doesn't impact the way that they did marriage,
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.040]   doesn't impact the way that they handle finances,
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.680]   it impacts the way that they attend X church every so often
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.480]   and you know, that's a good thing.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.160]   The Bible says your whole life,
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.000]   for the rest of your life,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.560]   God wants to transform you and bring about change
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.560]   and there is no limit.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.920]   Gosh, I just want you to get this so bad.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.320]   You have no idea how God wants to use you.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.480]   You have no idea how God can use you, will use you.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.840]   Like inside of the room,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.360]   there's probably honestly an overestimating of yourself.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.080]   You think more highly of who you are right now
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.680]   and you don't think highly enough about who you could be
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.160]   and who God wants you to be.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.880]   And inside of the scripture,
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.360]   you are told and I'm told,
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.920]   you're not gonna get there apart from these things.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.840]   You're not gonna experience,
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.760]   you probably could not dream highly enough of the person,
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.520]   the father you could be, the mother you could be,
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.360]   the husband, wife, the type of leader,
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.440]   follower of Jesus, the influencer that you could be.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.360]   There is no ceiling that is beyond
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.720]   what God could do with your life.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.120]   You're probably underestimating that
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.000]   and overestimating where you are right now.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   And the God who's there says,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.840]   man, if you will daily in everyday ordinary moments,
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.360]   live out my word, be dependent on me
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.560]   and walk in community with other believers,
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.960]   you do that, you're gonna see transformation
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.240]   like you wouldn't even believe.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.320]   This is how it's always worked, how it always will work
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.300]   and how God is at work right now.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.080]   In fact, instead of our ministry,
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.680]   we were talking today with some friends of Fort Worth.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.260]   Fort Worth is, this is their last time
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.160]   in the Ridgely Theater,
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.520]   which is where they've been meeting.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.760]   There's another building that they're moving into.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.800]   And one of the reasons they're moving out of that
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.840]   is because they're running out of space
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.520]   because God is at work changing people's lives
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.840]   in such radical ways.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.360]   And so we wanted to hear or give you a chance to hear
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.120]   from some of the stories that are just taking place
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.240]   from our friends in Fort Worth on a night like this,
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.120]   where they are transitioning.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.960]   So you guys check out these videos, this video.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.780]   (soft music)
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:44.080]   - We were addicted to self-pleasure.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.240]   - We were trying to earn our worth through athletics.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.760]   - We're emotional and physical abusers of women.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.600]   - Rebellious.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.440]   - Partiers.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:54.560]   perfection. We manipulated others. Starving for attention. Drowning in
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.480]   pornography and lust. We were addicted to pornography. We were crushed by disease,
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.280]   feeling hopeless, worthless, and forgotten. Consumed by alcohol. Hiding from community.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.840]   Sought to numb the pain. Lost in abusive relationships. People pleasers who
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.740]   thought we needed to perform for God. Obsessed with self-worth. Consumed by worldly
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.920]   success. Numb to the gospel. We were self-righteous hypocrites. We were broken.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   Broken. Broken. We were broken. Broken. We were broken. Then Christ. And then Christ
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.480]   rewrote the desires of my heart. Then Christ showed me that there is healing
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.720]   from addiction. Then Christ used total strangers to remind me just how
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.160]   worthwhile I was in His eyes. And then Christ showed me real freedom. Christ
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.880]   showed me I am valued. Loved me fully. Filled my life with purpose. He set me
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.640]   free. Then Christ showed me where real fulfillment is found. Then Christ revealed
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.540]   a transformative love for the first time. Now Christ has given us hope. My sins no
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.800]   longer define me. So come and see. Come and be. Come and see. Come and serve. Come and
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:55.040]   love. Come and see. Come and see. Come and see. Not our church, but our Jesus.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:11.880]   Man, that's just a handful of some of the... Can we clap for that? Of some of the stories that
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.240]   God has just been writing here. Not because of the porch. The porch doesn't write stories.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:20.940]   Jesus writes stories. The porch doesn't change anybody's life. Jesus changes lives. He's
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:24.640]   doing it in lots of places. Lots of churches. Lots of places He's at work. In
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.280]   a lot of places He's not. But in the places that He is, they're all doing the
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:33.040]   same thing. There's no silver bullet. If you want to experience change, it's gonna
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.400]   involve you living in community. Living out God's Word and living by His Spirit.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.160]   I want to make sure, and I'm gonna close with this, I want to make sure that I
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:45.320]   communicate really clearly. God is not saying, "Change first and then I will
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:54.640]   love and accept you." God is saying, "I love and accept you. And if you accept me, I am
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.920]   going to bring about change in your life because I'd love you too much to leave
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:04.960]   you that way." And if you're a follower of Jesus, He is doing that. Or you are
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:10.720]   silencing the voice of God. But He's a God who's there saying, "Man, I love you so
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.800]   much. Not change and you're accepted. I accept you way before you ever change." I
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.960]   have a friend who was going through the adoption process, and I'll close here.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:24.880]   She was a single girl and she was looking to adopt. And really, this
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.000]   happened with a couple friends that were going through adoption processes. And
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.360]   they were sharing about the adoption process. And they all shared that there
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:39.320]   was one part of it that was so hard. And it wasn't what I would have expected
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.320]   them to say. They were like, "If you adopt, it takes a lot of
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.440]   money and it takes a lot of time. It's like weeks at a time. There's interviews,
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.840]   people come to your house, all kinds of hard things." That's what I would have
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:54.080]   expected. They said, "No, no, the hardest thing by far is the questionnaire."
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.200]   "Questionnaire?" They fill out this questionnaire. They have everyone who
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   wants to adopt, and they have to go through. And it asks questions that just
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.080]   are hard to answer. Because they're questions around like, "What are the
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:10.920]   boundaries of your acceptance?" If the child's blind, will you accept her?
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.640]   Him or her? If the child has a mental disability, are you willing to accept
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.360]   them? If the child has a physical disability, are you willing to accept
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.640]   them? If so, which ones? If the child has a terminal illness, are you willing to
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.560]   accept them? And it goes through over and over and over again and lays out what the
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:30.240]   criteria under which they're willing to accept. Billy, you want to hand me the
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:37.200]   manual? You guys just talk amongst yourselves real quick. And Travis, am I
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:43.080]   good? Check, check. I've been wanting to get rid of this pink kind of headphone
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.840]   thing anyways. Anyways, you go through the boundaries of acceptance, and they say
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.720]   like, "Hey, these are the ones I'm accepting." Here's why they said it was so
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.880]   hard. It's so interesting. They said every box that you check, you're
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.320]   essentially telling a child they have one less home that they could go to.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.720]   You're putting parameters on the boundaries of what you're willing to
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.720]   accept someone. Boundaries on the willingness that you have to adopt that
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:10.240]   someone. When God looked at you, when God looked at the human race, here's what I
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.640]   want to make sure you hear me really loud and clear on. He said, "There are no
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.960]   boundaries to my acceptance." There's not a person in the room with a story that
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.760]   is too far out, that has done too much, that is too bad of a person, that has
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.680]   wrecked their lives too poorly. To be a candidate for my grace, to be a candidate,
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.000]   to be someone that I'm going to adopt, that I want to adopt, that I want to
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.640]   bring about radical change inside of their life, I will accept them regardless
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.000]   of their story. There is no boundaries to my acceptance. That's what God has said.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.480]   Every person in this room who's addicted to pornography, who has pornography in
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.960]   their past, who's a manipulator, you're a womanizer. There's guys in this room who
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:50.360]   are womanizers. There's women in this room. There's an abortion in your
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.960]   past you never told anyone about. And the God who's there is not angry at you. He's
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.880]   crazy about you. He loves you so much you died for you on a cross to
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.840]   communicate that to you. To say there is no boundaries to my love, to my
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:09.040]   acceptance, to those who I will adopt and make my children. I don't know what your
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.600]   story is in the room, but if you're sitting there, and this happens so often
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.400]   where the person's like, "Man, you just don't know my story." You really think
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:22.160]   you're the one exception? You must be new here. Because the stories, candidly, just
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.760]   of the people that lead around here, are stories of people with incredibly
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.360]   broken pasts. People with brokenness where we're still saying, "God, take my
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:36.400]   life. Help me, Lord. Take ground in my heart. I want to be more of God's man."
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.920]   Whatever is in front of you right now, whatever you've never shared with anyone,
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.000]   or whatever you feel like is owning you, I want you to know change is possible.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.400]   There's a Savior who loves you, who gave himself for you, who has placed no
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:55.680]   boundaries on his acceptance of you. And yet, like any good parent, if he adopts
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.560]   you into his family by faith, by trusting in him, he's gonna do what good parents
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.720]   do. They raise their kids. They bring about change and growth. And that's what
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.560]   he's gonna do in your life. And if he does it, he's gonna do it in these three
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:14.640]   ways, with his people, his spirit, and applying his word. There is no boundaries
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.880]   to his acceptance and no boundaries to what he wants to do in your life if you
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:28.600]   will let him. And the chance is yours tonight. From the God who's there, who
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:34.640]   knows everything wrong with you, and says, "Man, will you surrender that to me? Walk
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:44.240]   with my people, and you'll experience freedom, change, life, hope." Let me pray.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:43:03.640]   Father, thank you just for the ways that you're at work, God. It's undeniable for
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:09.160]   so many of us who are not perfect, but we're just experiencing that there's a
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:15.520]   God who loves us enough to convict, to move us towards repentance, to confess.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:23.880]   Thank you for the fact that no story in this room is over, because there's hope
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:32.400]   with you. And as we've said before, hope has a name, Jesus. I pray for in this room
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:40.640]   the man or woman right now who's scared. They're carrying something candidly. They
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.160]   think they're gonna die with. They're gonna carry this to their grave. They'll
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.120]   never tell anyone that you would, in your kindness and grace, just move them towards
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.760]   sharing with whoever they trust around them, whether it's one of our volunteers,
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.080]   somebody around them who'd love to just pray with, come alongside, or someone
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.280]   that they know is a follower of Jesus. That they'd be willing to just say, "Man, this is
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.600]   the baggage, or this is some of the guilt and shame I'm carrying." And then into
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:10.040]   that guilt and into the sin of our life, your grace would run deeper, and you
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:17.160]   would grab more of us. We'd experience more of you, more of your love, and we
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.720]   would look more like Jesus. God, would you chip away everything that doesn't look
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:27.120]   like him and do something marvelous with the men and women in front of me? For
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:33.120]   your name and your glory, would you kill the pride in my heart, God? Would you help
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:40.200]   me? Would you help us all? In Christ's name, amen.
