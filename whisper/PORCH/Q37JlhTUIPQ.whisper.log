[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.880]   In preparing the message,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.040]   we're always thinking through the opening story, right?
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.320]   And so my team asked me,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.680]   we have a sermon prep team,
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.080]   as we put together these messages,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.920]   and they said,
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.920]   "Well, do you have a story of somebody
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.800]   "doing something really stupid when they were drunk?"
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.960]   And like all of these slides
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.640]   start flashing through my head, you know?
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.060]   I was like, the better question,
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.360]   do I have a story of anybody doing something not stupid
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.200]   when they were drunk?
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.240]   Like that would be much more difficult to find,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.020]   but as you know, if you've been running with us,
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.040]   I wasn't a follower of Christ in college,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.600]   and so that really looked like every weekend
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.640]   watching somebody do something ridiculously stupid
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.800]   when they were drunk.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.360]   Sometimes it was me,
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.140]   but the memories that flashed through my head,
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.800]   I mean, I remember one particular night,
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.240]   a really close friend of mine had too much to drink.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.560]   I mean, have you ever seen someone
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.640]   who has had too much to drink?
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.800]   I mean, too much.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.480]   Like, a whole 'nother level too much,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.840]   like, okay, like cannot control themselves,
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.960]   out of control, drunk.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.560]   And so it starts with kind of the tragedy,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.680]   tragic events of that night.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.600]   Start with him wanting to go to his truck to drive,
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.720]   and I'm like, you cannot do,
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.360]   I just remember trying to reason with a drunk man,
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.080]   like, you cannot do this.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.480]   Give me your keys, you know?
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.840]   And you can't drive.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.600]   If you drive, there's going to be casualties.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.720]   This will not be good.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.400]   And he's like, no, I can't, I can't, I'm good, man.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.960]   You know, and you're like, no, you can't even talk,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.920]   you can't even stand, much less drive down the road.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.240]   Give me your keys.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.400]   Then it progresses to he wanted to fight me, right?
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.520]   And I'm just like, I'm not into that.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.200]   Like, you know, I'm not gonna drive.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.360]   Then he wanted to fight.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.360]   Then he wanted to jump on the top of a Porsche,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.080]   like, just thought it was a good idea,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.560]   it was a nice, beautiful Porsche.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.120]   And it's like, I think I can stand on the hood.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.200]   No, bro, that's not a good idea, man.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.320]   Let's not do that.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   And then it progressed to he was gonna walk across 35.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.160]   And so there's I-35 there in Waco.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.600]   It's like traffic, just cars flying by, okay,
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.400]   eight lanes right there.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.520]   And he's like, no, I think I can make it across.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520]   It's like Frogger, but live.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.960]   And I'm like, buddy, you're not gonna do this.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.760]   And just trying to stop him and trying to reason
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.000]   with a drunk person is never a good idea
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.800]   because when you're under the influence,
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.760]   you have this force kind of pulling you
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.560]   in another direction, usually a very ignorant direction.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.640]   No one ever is like, dude, I did brain surgery last night.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.800]   Yeah, I was so drunk.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.000]   You know, it's never good, right?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.720]   Like, yep, found the cure for cancer.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.840]   I was wasted.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.360]   It's always, somebody, it's always an excuse.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.080]   It's like, dude, did you know you texted her?
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.120]   It's like, yeah, I was drunk.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.920]   You know, did you know you said that?
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.160]   Yeah, I was drunk.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.640]   It's like an excuse for doing something incredibly stupid.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.240]   I was under the influence.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.200]   Well, tonight we're talking about being under an influence
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.280]   of something else, this idea of love.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.000]   Now, it operates really similarly.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.880]   Some of you will do some very, very stupid things
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.240]   when you're under the influence of love.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.840]   I have done some very stupid things
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.160]   under the influence of love.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.840]   It is this force that is pulling us
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.920]   sometimes against our will in a direction
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.680]   we do not wanna go because of our feelings
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.640]   and emotions and our thoughts and these urges
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.120]   that we cannot bring under our control.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.360]   In fact, they bring us under their control.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.760]   We're actually following them.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.320]   And so had my friend gotten in a car
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.760]   and gotten stopped by the police,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.240]   he would have gotten a DUI.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.760]   That's driving under the influence.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.400]   Tonight, as we continue our series, Lyrics and Lies,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.920]   I wanna talk about dating under the influence,
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.520]   not the influence of alcohol,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.960]   but the influence of love, feelings, emotions,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.280]   sexual urges, whatever you wanna put there,
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.760]   whatever that is for you, dating under the influence
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.440]   where you are no longer in control
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.200]   because that's what drunk means.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.640]   Drunk, by Webster's definition, is loss of control
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.200]   of one's faculties or behavior.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.680]   Simply put, you are no longer in control.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.360]   And as I've already stated, it's never a good thing.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.440]   No one is like, yeah, solved global warming, I was drunk.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.280]   It's always something bad happens whenever you are drunk,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   yet some of us actually pursue that,
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.440]   and many of us pursue that reality,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.000]   that idea in relationships.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.840]   We wanna be out of control to our feelings.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.480]   The world actually tells you that's a good thing.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   I'm telling you, that's not a good thing.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.040]   It's not a wise thing.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.800]   It's not a God-honoring thing.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.920]   It is a going to hurt you kind of thing.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.440]   And so we're looking at Beyonce's drunk in love,
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.720]   and I know people love Beyonce, all right?
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.560]   There's many people, girls love Beyonce.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.680]   She might make you feel sexy,
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.720]   or there's just something in you that can relate to her,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.160]   or maybe you love that she's this empowered woman
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.440]   and she's married to Jay-Z and they have this
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.440]   kind of crazy, you know, rock star relationship.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.960]   But this song is a tragedy.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.240]   In fact, it's the only one I will not read you the lyrics to.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.040]   Too far, too far.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.320]   It is not good for our hearts,
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.840]   and I know I sound like your parents,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.520]   but give me a shot as I open the scriptures
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.680]   from the one who created the heavens and the earth,
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.920]   and who loves you and has a plan for you,
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.400]   a plan to prosper you, a plan to do incredible things
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   for you, and what he says from the word this evening.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.880]   So I know we live in a sexual charged culture,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.040]   but the creator says that there is a sin
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.400]   that is different from all other kinds of sin.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.160]   There is a sin that is against your own body,
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.560]   1 Corinthians 6:18.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.800]   There's this one sin that is unique.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.600]   And so if I'm the enemy, if I'm Satan,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.120]   then I want to take out humanity,
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.520]   I want to kill you under some false pretense
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.040]   that I'm gonna give you life, but actually bring you death.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.840]   What am I gonna go after?
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.200]   I'm gonna go after sex.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.800]   I'm gonna go after sex,
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.080]   and I'm going to make you inoculated to it
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.240]   so that it's everywhere,
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.560]   so you no longer have these boundaries,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.320]   because the culture for you to put any kind of boundaries
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.240]   around it, the culture might call you legalistic,
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.160]   or prude, or stupid, or foolish, or crazy,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.600]   yet they're continually running off a cliff into divorce,
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.400]   into tragedy, into disease, into HIV, into abortions,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.040]   into unwanted children,
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   into emotional desperation and disaster.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.240]   And they're saying, hey, this is the way, follow us.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.920]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.440]   If you were God, if you were the creator
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.840]   of the heavens and the earth, where would you put sex?
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.720]   Would you say, like you're writing the Bible,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.400]   hey, it's fine between two consenting adults.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.960]   Is that where you'd put it?
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.760]   Hey, it's fine as long as both people agree to it.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.800]   Hey, it's fine in any regards.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.960]   Where would you put it?
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.240]   As you consider disease, death, abortions,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   unwanted children, the emotional attachment that occurs
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.680]   and then breaks, the rewiring, sex trafficking,
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.400]   sex for profit, where would you put it?
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   Where would you make it available to those you love?
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.880]   So as we move through this idea of dating
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.360]   under the influence, talking about being drunk in love,
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.720]   as Beyonce puts it, I thought I'd start with a story
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.280]   from the Bible, from the scriptures.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.760]   It's a historical account, it's a true story.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.200]   David, you guys know of David, David and Goliath, okay?
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.400]   David fought the giant or David and Bathsheba.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.960]   Usually it's one of those two.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.360]   Well, today we're not talking about giants.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.880]   And so David is the king of a kingdom,
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.280]   a very powerful kingdom, it's God's kingdom.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.560]   God has pointed David king by a really unsuspecting path.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.640]   Okay, that means he wasn't the son of the king.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.200]   He kind of come up, he was just, he came up,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.480]   he was just a shepherd boy.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.760]   God appoints him as king.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.960]   David loves God, the scripture says he's a man
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.120]   after God's own heart.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.520]   And one day his kingdom, his people are at war.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.120]   Now anytime the king's armies are at war,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.280]   the king would go with them.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.000]   But this time in the scripture, in 2 Samuel 11,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.720]   it goes out of its way to tell you that David stayed back.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.200]   David was at home, okay?
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.680]   And so David did not go to war with his armies,
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.560]   he stayed back, and it says that he was walking
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.440]   along the rooftops.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.920]   Now as he's walking along the rooftops,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.040]   he's probably bored, his armies are in a foreign land,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.720]   fighting, you know, a war, and he's at home,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   left to his own devices, he sees a babe named Bathsheba.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.220]   She's bathing, she is cleansing herself
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.480]   after her menstrual cycle is actually what is going on.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.120]   And so he sees her bathing and he's attracted to her
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.160]   and he says, hey, who is that?
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.320]   That's Eliam's wife, I mean, that's Eliam's daughter.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.280]   Uriah's wife, the Hittite.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.840]   To which David should say, oh, one of my mighty men's wives?
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.960]   One of the guys who's in a foreign land
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.600]   fighting a battle for me right now?
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.740]   Well, will you send her some flowers and tell her
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.240]   thank you for staying back while your husband
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.160]   does the work of the kingdom?
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.460]   We're so grateful for you.
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.080]   How different would the story be?
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.240]   What you're going to hear right now
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.040]   is one of the most catastrophic sins
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.260]   of all the scriptures, in fact.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.260]   It's been described as the single most catastrophic sin,
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.900]   most disastrous sin in all of the Bible.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:40.440]   Instead of saying thank her, he says, bring her to me.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:47.060]   And David takes Uriah's wife and he sleeps with her.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.260]   Now, Uriah was one of David's mighty men,
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.960]   so was Bathsheba's dad, Eliam,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.420]   and so Uriah and Eliam are at war together.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.580]   This is a match made in heaven, Uriah and Bathsheba,
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.460]   that they were both fighting in David's army.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.740]   Hey, bro, why don't you date my daughter?
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.740]   Why don't you marry her?
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.260]   This was that kind of wedding.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.220]   Like, this was a Jay-Z and Beyonce
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.860]   kind of relationship, if you will.
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.380]   Everybody's watching on.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.620]   She's really beautiful.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.980]   Women want to be her.
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.740]   And so, this is what David comes in between
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.380]   and says, she's going to be mine.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.620]   I'll take her as my own.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.300]   What does it mean that they were David's mighty men?
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.140]   When he was running from Saul,
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.780]   from King Saul was after him,
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.920]   these men risked their lives to come and rescue him,
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.760]   to come and find him.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.580]   That's who this is.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.820]   That's what the depth of this betrayal.
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.860]   Why did he do it?
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.260]   'Cause he was drunk in love.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.500]   'Cause he was drunk in love.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.340]   He sleeps with her.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.180]   When he wakes up the next morning, he sends her away.
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.020]   Why?
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.020]   Because shame always breaks intimacy.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.060]   You ever had one of those moments?
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.100]   Like, what did I just do?
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.040]   That's what Beyonce says.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.260]   How did we get here on the kitchen floor?
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.460]   How did this happen, she says.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.500]   That's what David says.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.860]   Wakes up, what am I?
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.700]   What did I do?
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.340]   Go, get away from me.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.260]   Get out of here.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.300]   Doesn't talk to her.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.220]   You ever been there?
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.580]   Oh, well, who are you?
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.660]   What did we do?
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:18.420]   She calls him, maybe texts him.
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.260]   Sends a letter.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.540]   Says, hey, I'm pregnant.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.380]   Bro.
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.340]   David, being a schemer, says,
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.300]   hey, bring Uriah back from battle.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.540]   Now, if you're Uriah, you're like,
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.100]   what am I, why are you bringing me back here?
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.900]   What do you want me to do, King?
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.220]   Now, David, being a schemer, is like,
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.780]   hey, sleep with your wife
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.260]   so that you'll think it's actually your kid.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.500]   How awful is that?
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.900]   Do you know what Uriah says?
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.940]   I can't do, I'm not gonna go home, King.
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.660]   David says, hey, go ahead, go home,
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.860]   be with your wife.
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.420]   Uriah says, no, my men are at battle.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.540]   They're sleeping in tents.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.500]   I will sleep outside on the palace floor,
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.860]   on the palace steps.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.580]   Uriah's a faithful dude.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.780]   Faithful man.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.580]   You know what David does?
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.580]   David says, all right, come here.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.980]   He gets him drunk, thinking that if he can bring him
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.700]   under the influence, that he will then go
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.100]   and sleep with his wife.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.380]   But Uriah was faithful.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.300]   Even under the influence, he slept on the palace steps.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.300]   So David has to increase his scheme.
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.100]   Calls his first commander, Joab, and says,
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.060]   hey, I want you to put Uriah on the front lines
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.460]   where the battle is the fiercest
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.020]   so that he would be struck by the enemy and killed.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.060]   Wow.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.820]   Uriah goes back to battle.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.340]   The plan is executed exactly as he thought it up.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.780]   Uriah is struck down by the enemy.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.180]   He is killed.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.220]   God sends Nathan, the friend and prophet to David
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.740]   and says, you have done an awful thing,
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.700]   and because you have done this, okay,
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.700]   the sword is going to come to your house.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.220]   There is going to be a war in your household,
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.780]   and the son that you have now created
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.580]   through Bathsheba will die.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:07.060]   David's son dies, and disaster strikes,
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.820]   and the kingdom falls apart.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.220]   And Nathan says specifically,
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.220]   someone very close to you is going to sleep with your wives.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.860]   And David's son, Absalom,
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.780]   who saw how his father treated women,
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:31.780]   comes and sleeps with his wives on the roof of the palace.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:37.660]   God says what you have done in quiet or in private,
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.060]   disaster will come to you in broad daylight.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.020]   And David's son sleeps with his wives
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.420]   on the top of the palace.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.060]   How corrupt and wicked is that?
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:53.300]   The legacy of this sin that comes from being drunk in love
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.940]   and making decisions out of emotions,
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.340]   following the monster inside of you
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.260]   if you were here a few weeks ago.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.780]   David has another son.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.460]   That son's name is Solomon.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.880]   He was known as the wisest man in all the world
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.820]   other than Jesus.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.700]   He wrote a book that we know as the book of wisdom
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.620]   called the Proverbs.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.180]   And that will be in Proverbs five.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.020]   Turn with me.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:24.620]   Solomon saw this all go down.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.540]   He saw how his dad responded in adultery.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.460]   He knew who his father was, the wives, plural, that he had.
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.740]   And he writes this.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.460]   He says, "Drink water from your own cistern."
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.000]   Drunk in love starts, I've been drinking.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.420]   I've been drinking.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.140]   "Drink water from your own cistern,
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.220]   "running water from your own well.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.920]   "Should your springs overflow in the streets,
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.680]   "your streams of water in the public squares,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.340]   "let them be yours alone,
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.520]   "never to be shared with strangers."
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.500]   It's talking about sex, love, emotion,
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.400]   these feelings that we have and the acts that go with them.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.000]   "May your fountain be blessed
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.600]   "and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth,
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.580]   "a loving doe, a graceful deer.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.100]   "May her breasts satisfy you always.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:19.100]   "May you ever or forever be drunk with her love."
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.820]   Intoxicated with her love.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.620]   The word for intoxicated right there,
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.260]   it has two meanings that actually contrast each other
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.620]   and you can understand why they fit together.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.740]   It means either captivated or led astray.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.940]   Captivated or led astray.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.140]   You're gonna see both meanings in this passage.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.740]   The first one is captivated.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.300]   May you be captivated.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.700]   See also committed to her in love.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.700]   May you be stuck with her in love,
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.580]   one person for a lifetime.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.420]   For this is your well, this is your provision,
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.840]   this is your cistern.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.660]   My first point is a question or really a revelation,
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.420]   love, where to drink.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.740]   So where should we drink of love?
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.980]   Verse 15, "Drink water from your own cistern,
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.500]   "running water from your own well."
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.980]   And so cisterns and wells control water.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.100]   They give it boundaries, they hold it in place.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.020]   They keep it where it should be kept.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.240]   But it says, "Do not let your water run out
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.200]   "into the streets.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.300]   "If it is broken, it can go anywhere."
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.620]   That you would follow that desire wherever it would lead.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.180]   Just like a flowing water down the streets,
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.660]   nothing to hold it, nothing to contain it.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.760]   Wherever it would go, you would follow it.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.580]   And for some of you, this has happened.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.860]   You understand what it's like to give yourself
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.580]   to someone in the act of sex,
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.220]   the sacred act of which God created,
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.520]   maybe as a Christian or as a non-Christian
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.860]   before you knew Christ.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.340]   And then all of the sudden, it's devalued.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.420]   Maybe the first time was difficult
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.820]   and it was like, I'll never do that again.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.780]   And then the second time and the third time
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.340]   and the fourth time, it's easier.
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.860]   And then all of the sudden, it's a weakened sport.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.380]   And maybe it's a way that you would feel love
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.340]   and receive love.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.020]   Or, well, I loved him and then I loved him.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.920]   I loved her, I loved her.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.920]   And maybe the act isn't even with a person,
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:13.320]   but by yourself, with an image or a video
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.160]   that we would give ourselves,
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.120]   that we would take this act that God created
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.040]   for a very specific purpose,
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.200]   and we would enjoy it for our own fleeting pleasure
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.000]   so that we might wake up and say, what happened?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.680]   What did I do?
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.280]   What did I do?
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:38.080]   So you are a place, all of you are a place
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.500]   for one person to drink from.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.760]   That person is the person that you would be married to,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.680]   not will be married to, but are married to.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.180]   You're reserved for them.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:54.840]   Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.240]   There is one well from which you can drink,
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.120]   and that is your one solution for sexual release.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.240]   In 1 Corinthians 7, verse nine, it's described like this.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.520]   But if they burn with passion, let them marry.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.320]   If they burn with passion, let them masturbate.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.160]   If they burn with passion, let them cohabitate.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.920]   If they burn with passion, let them experiment,
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.560]   make sure everything fits.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.580]   'Cause as long as they're going to get married, no.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.360]   The scripture says, if they burn with passion,
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   if they're drunk in love, they should get married.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.960]   For it is better to be married
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:40.560]   than to be given to passion and feelings and emotions
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.800]   and do foolish things outside of marriage.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.520]   Plainly, as it can say.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:54.800]   So the visual here is, and I hate saying this
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.400]   'cause I'm not trying to instill shame.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.000]   If you know my story, I'm a recovering sex addict.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.040]   It's a huge, enormous part of my story.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:09.360]   I'm a person who has been shared.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.600]   You know, I've been around.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.320]   The picture, the image that he gives us
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.000]   is you have one place to drink from.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.880]   And that you shouldn't share that with a stranger.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.880]   We go to this park all the time on the weekends
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.440]   with my kids, and in the middle of this park,
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.120]   it's a public park, and it's an old park.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.280]   And in the middle of it is a water fountain.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.480]   And I walk by there, and I always think the same thing.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.440]   Who drinks from that?
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.640]   Because everyone drinks from it,
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.720]   therefore no one should drink from it, right?
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.080]   And some of you here, you're like,
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.640]   yeah, I wouldn't drink after a stranger.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.360]   I wouldn't drink after someone,
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.700]   like someone put their mouth on a, I don't.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.760]   But yet you would lie with one.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.640]   You would make out with one.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.320]   You would be with one, and then another one,
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.520]   and then another one.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:09.760]   I don't say that to instill shame on you at all.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.800]   I'm telling you, Monica, Mary, my wife,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.700]   Mary, the guide.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.880]   That's strangers, you know?
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.400]   That's a part of my past.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.720]   You've gotta recover from that.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.760]   I'm not saying right now, hey, be owned by that,
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.320]   feel guilty for that, but I am saying,
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.800]   hey, if that's a part of your story,
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.960]   it's a much bigger deal than you probably thought,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.080]   'cause it's a much bigger deal
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.560]   than the world presents to you.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.440]   And you must pursue a path of recovery in the midst of that.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.040]   It begins now.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.160]   Stop hiding it, stop sweeping it under the rug,
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.600]   stop thinking it's not a big deal.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.120]   It's a big deal.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.960]   But God's grace is a bigger deal.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.560]   He says, "May your fountain be blessed,
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.120]   "and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth."
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.640]   Blessed how?
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.440]   And will the Lord give you an amazing sex life
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.300]   if you wait for marriage?
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.680]   I don't know.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.560]   I have no idea, man.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.160]   I've met people, I've counseled people
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.960]   from the Scriptures who waited 'til they were married
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.200]   and they can't have sex,
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   either because of a physical issue or a mental block.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.640]   They're unable to have sex.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.960]   And some of them have the maturity to say,
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.240]   you know what, this wasn't promised to me.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.440]   Others of them are mad at God.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.440]   They're like, hey, how dare you?
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.280]   I waited.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.280]   You know, they've struck this deal with God.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.520]   There was an article that went around.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.360]   I don't know if you read it.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.520]   It was written by Samantha Pugsley,
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.840]   and it titled, "I waited until my wedding night
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.440]   "to lose my virginity, and I wish I hadn't."
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.880]   And here's the problem.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.800]   She waited because she made a deal with God
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.880]   that God never made.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.200]   God, if I do, then you will.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.680]   He didn't strike that deal.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.000]   He said, hey, if you follow me and know me
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.080]   and seek me and trust in my Son as a revision for your sins,
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.760]   I'm gonna give you heaven, which is much better than sex,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.560]   forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.560]   You can be with me in my kingdom.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.760]   Can you have sex?
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.720]   Probably.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.480]   Will it be amazing?
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.840]   You'll have to work at it.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.320]   It's true.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.320]   It's true.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.160]   It's not, I know, I know that most of us in the room
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.680]   are single, and you think the honeymoon's gonna be like,
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.520]   (imitates rocket launching)
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.800]   rockets going off and birds singing.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.520]   Beyonce and Jay-Z, something crazy.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.440]   I don't know.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.080]   Don't picture it.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.720]   Today, Samantha Pugsley is a bisexual in an open marriage
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.080]   giving you relationship advice.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.040]   Some of you read that and thought, hmm,
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.920]   maybe she's right, she's not right.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.760]   God's right.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   I'm just telling you.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:02.560]   We were meant to be content with one spouse for a lifetime,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.400]   so what happened?
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.360]   He says, verse 20, "Why my son be intoxicated
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.760]   "with another man's wife?"
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.960]   I want you to read that as,
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   "Why be drunk in love with anyone
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.200]   "except the one you are married to?"
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.960]   Why be intoxicated with another man's wife?
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.960]   Why be intoxicated with anyone you are not married to
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.760]   that's not your wife?
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.720]   If they're not your wife, they're another man's wife.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.840]   But they will be my wife.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.600]   You don't know what will happen tomorrow, James says.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.760]   Oh, you know better than God.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.920]   Let's play that game.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.680]   Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.640]   For your ways are in full view of the Lord,
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.240]   and he examines all your paths.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.280]   For your ways are in full view of the Lord.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.800]   Ray Rice didn't know that.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:03.080]   For your ways are in full view of the Lord,
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.200]   and he examines all your paths.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.440]   My second point is, love where not to drink.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.920]   Where not to drink from anyone you are not married to.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.440]   Okay, pastor, that's cute, man.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.120]   You're up there, know the Bible.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.360]   Don't be drunk in love with anyone I'm not married to.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.240]   That's cool.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.840]   I know that some of you are so brainwashed
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.120]   by culture, I was too, by the way.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.440]   I get it, like there is a strong current today
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.680]   with sexually charged culture.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.960]   Satan's winning the battle on sex, okay,
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.520]   just in case you're wondering,
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.280]   and you're a pawn in his game,
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.960]   and you're one of the methods by which he's winning,
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.440]   'cause he's won over your heart and your mind,
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.760]   and you haven't renewed it, as the scripture says,
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.680]   and you have not allowed the spirit
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.280]   to guard your hearts and your minds,
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.760]   and so you are entertained by the very things
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.560]   Jesus died for.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.840]   You are entertained by it, and he has won you over,
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.600]   and he says this is the way, he says,
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.000]   date as the world dates, be intoxicated by love,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.120]   follow your feelings and emotions,
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.760]   all the way to divorce court over and over again,
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.120]   all the way to sadness and despair and depression,
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.400]   and God says, my sweet, sweet little girl,
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.880]   I love you, and I've got a better plan for you than that.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:24.360]   Young man, I know you, and I know there's a war
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.960]   inside your body, but will you yield to my spirit
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.760]   over your own will, over your flesh?
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.120]   Will you listen to me?
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   What happened, we're so far from where we should be, guys.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.360]   One thing that happened in our culture
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.320]   is the pursuit of variety from a very early age.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.360]   I mean, even the way that you asked so and so
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.240]   to go around with you in the sixth grade,
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.360]   or will you go with me, whatever that was for you,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.000]   however you said it, check yes or no, I don't know.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.600]   We start dating really young,
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.560]   and we start exploring the opposite sex
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.080]   at a very young age, and you go back to your old life,
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.280]   your first kiss in your mind, some of you,
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.240]   if that's a part of your story,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.440]   and it probably happened way before it should have.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.120]   There's an explosion of hormones, an explosion of emotion,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.160]   and now you're on a track where you are now addicted
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.180]   to attention from the opposite sex,
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.840]   constantly needing more from them, finding identity in it.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.720]   If you are in a happy relationship,
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.040]   all is well in your world.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.840]   If you are in a bad relationship,
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.200]   all is terrible in your world.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.040]   If you're not in a relationship,
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.240]   all is despairing in your world.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.280]   You've been left out.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.280]   God has forgotten you.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.360]   He has forsaken you.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.080]   He doesn't love you, is the lies of the enemy.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.240]   And he says, no, my child, I have not forsaken you,
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.260]   I have not forgotten you, and I love you more
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.600]   than you could ever comprehend.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.000]   In fact, I'm waiting on you.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.920]   I'm waiting to be ultimate to you.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.760]   I am pursuing you and wooing you
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.200]   and trying to win back your heart from the world.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.840]   Trying to win back your heart from boys,
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.340]   trying to win back your heart from porn,
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.400]   trying to win back your heart from the addiction
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.440]   of relationships since the fifth grade,
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.720]   the roller coaster that you've been on.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.360]   And so we've been addicted to variety.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.080]   That's what addiction to pornography is,
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.380]   is certainly not an addiction to sex.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:26.380]   Porn is college for sex with multiple people.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.080]   Do you understand that?
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.320]   Porn, from the very first interaction of it,
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.440]   is training your brain not to be attracted to one person,
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.040]   also known as monogamy, but to be attracted to many people,
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.000]   a variety of people at the same time.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.280]   In fact, the porn addict, by scientific happenings,
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:49.120]   cannot be attracted to one person.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.120]   The porn addict, it is impossible in the moment
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.080]   and in that addiction to be attracted to one person.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.960]   They have trained and wired their brain not to,
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.920]   but before you're like, yeah, well, I'm not a porn,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.360]   so has the fantasy addict, so has the one who engages
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.760]   and loves "Fifty Shades of Grey" or romance novels
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.000]   or any kind of fantasy of that sort.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.840]   So has the one who is constantly dating boys
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.920]   in her mind she's never met on Facebook.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:21.040]   You have also trained and wired your brain for variety,
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.600]   a fantasy that never existed,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.600]   a standard that no one will ever meet for you.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.120]   Prince Charming will never show up.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:31.960]   Why?
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.880]   He doesn't exist as you have created him up here.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.760]   That's why.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.800]   You are pursuing something unreal.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.500]   What do I do, JP?
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:50.800]   Get help now, tonight.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.880]   You say, he's talking about me, I need help.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.720]   He's talking to me, I need help.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.240]   And you start a path to recovery tonight
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.080]   because you will not be satisfied by one person.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.960]   That's what this proverb is saying.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.340]   See, God's design is for one person for life,
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.000]   that you would be forever pleased by her.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.280]   I want you to know that I don't believe
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.680]   that Beyonce and Jay-Z are describing
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.800]   that kind of being drunk in love,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.760]   that the intoxication, that is a captivation for a lifetime.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.720]   They're actually selling you a lie.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.360]   I'm well aware that they're married,
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.040]   but they are selling you a lie.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.160]   They are drunk in lust.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.720]   Okay, if you read the words of the song,
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.760]   I don't encourage you to.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.080]   It is very, very apparent.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.720]   And so secondly, I want you to know
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.960]   that I know that many pastors have stood before you
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.440]   and told you not to have sex,
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.440]   but very few have explained why.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.800]   Simply saying because the Bible has says so,
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.320]   which is a good enough reason,
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.240]   but I'm telling you there's a reason the Bible says so,
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.440]   because God loves you.
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.740]   And if you enjoy something out of its intentions,
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.580]   too often you cannot enjoy it as it was intended.
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.960]   Let me say that again.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.580]   If you have sex outside of marriage,
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.420]   you may not be able to enjoy sex inside of marriage,
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.700]   because the type of sex you tasted,
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.940]   the type of sex you've grown addicted to
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.660]   is that which is outside of marriage.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.500]   And so how do you continue to have that high, that thrill?
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.380]   You have to continually going outside your marriage.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.820]   Why are adultery rates skyrocketing?
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.260]   This is why.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.140]   If you have climbed the fence to get something,
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.900]   you will not be able to go through the gate.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.420]   If you have eaten stolen food and you like the taste of it,
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.020]   you will not like the taste when it's handed to you.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.000]   Do you hear me?
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.380]   God loves you.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.180]   He has a plan for you.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.180]   He's not trying to rip you off.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.540]   He's trying to give you life.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.020]   He says, "You don't understand that I created this act."
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.100]   He's the inventor of sex.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.940]   He made the ports.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.100]   He made 'em work the way they do.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.940]   I'll get awkward if you want me to.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.620]   He put the nerve endings where he did.
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:08.100]   He made it feel the way he did in her and in him.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.740]   It's a very incredible thing
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.300]   that it would create life inside of a woman.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.900]   Life would be created through this act,
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.180]   and God made it good.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.700]   He didn't just make it good, he made it feel good.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.700]   Satan says, "Hey, why don't you take the pleasure
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.060]   "for yourself without all of the purpose?"
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.280]   Let me say that again.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.860]   Satan says, "Why don't you take the pleasure
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.700]   "for yourself without the purpose
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.340]   "so that you might enjoy it for yourself?
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.980]   "Climb in, climb over the fence, steal some of this food,
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.660]   "for you know better than God."
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:49.580]   You cannot replicate that kind of sex in marriage.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.220]   There's an unsafeness to it.
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.260]   To it that exists only outside of marriage.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.380]   See, sex inside of marriage is safe sex.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:03.140]   It's safeguarded that a man would care for you,
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.580]   not beat you or hit you or hurt you,
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:11.540]   but be gentle to you and you to him, and it's safe.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:16.860]   And if you've grown an addiction to unsafe sex,
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.980]   then you try to bring unsafe sex in the marriage.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.540]   And I want you to know, as lovingly as I can,
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.700]   that's what Beyonce and Jay-Z have tried to do here.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.060]   They have shown you a picture of unsafe sex
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.220]   with references to two men
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.260]   who were notorious spouse abusers,
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.460]   and one man who was a convicted rapist.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.420]   All of those references are in this song,
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.340]   saying this is what being drunk in love looks like.
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.340]   No, man.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.420]   No, sir.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.380]   Some of you didn't even know that,
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.700]   and you've been feeding your heart.
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.980]   That lie.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.500]   Telling your heart, this is what I want.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.060]   I want it like Beyonce.
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.380]   And you didn't even know.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.580]   Satan's at work in that, man.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:05.020]   It's counterfeit sex.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:11.900]   Some of us are addicted to counterfeit sex.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.020]   Got my hair cut this week, in case you didn't notice.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.940]   And the girl that was, I walked in, it was empty,
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.420]   and she was reading a book, and she puts away her book,
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.540]   and then she starts cutting my hair,
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.780]   and then it got full, like people started walking in.
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.340]   And she said, well, I guess, we were talking,
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.860]   and she goes, I guess I won't do much reading today.
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.300]   I said, what are you reading?
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.820]   She said, I'm just finishing Fifty Shades of Grey.
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.300]   And I said, oh, man, you don't want some man
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.620]   to love you like that.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.780]   And she goes, you haven't read it, have you?
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.460]   You don't understand.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.780]   And she goes, it's a love story.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.340]   And I said, no, you don't understand what love is.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.620]   You have redefined love in something
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.820]   it was never meant to be.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.700]   That's what Beyonce and Jay are doing.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.820]   You don't understand what love is.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.660]   I said, you married?
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.180]   She said, divorced.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.020]   I understand.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.220]   I get it.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.980]   I get it, there's a love, no greater love than this,
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.980]   that someone would lay down their life for you,
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.300]   Ephesians 5:25, that your husband would love you
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.580]   as Christ loved the church, man.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.740]   Giving his life for you.
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.220]   That you would come and willingly submit
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.620]   to that kind of leadership as a man would come to you
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.980]   and say, hey, I'm putting you before myself,
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.180]   your contentment and joy before my own.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.260]   Whatever I can do to care for you and to provide for you,
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.540]   not to steal from your vineyard, not to climb the fence,
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.780]   not to talk you into something you don't wanna do
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.340]   or give in to some emotional, passionate moment,
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.580]   saying, I don't fear God.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.740]   'Cause that's the only reason he would do that.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.180]   He doesn't fear God.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:50.380]   God, I think I know better than you,
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.540]   here's what's happening when you have sex
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.300]   outside of marriage, okay?
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:01.060]   He's grabbing you by the face and pulling you close.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:04.100]   And he's telling you, did you know
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:10.140]   that when left to my own desires or following God's will,
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.220]   I'm going to follow my desires?
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:13.700]   Over God's will.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.940]   And you're dating, so it's at the very height
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.260]   of the relationship.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:22.180]   I mean, he's trying to show you a false sense
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.660]   of who he really is to win your heart.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.060]   And he's telling you right now, I am committed
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.820]   to being willing to have sex outside of marriage
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.300]   if it is what I feel like.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.780]   And you say, no, you don't understand.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.140]   He loves me.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.300]   He does today.
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.340]   In fact, he loves you so much, he's willing
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.380]   to compromise God's word for you.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.380]   In fact, he's telling you as sincerely as he can,
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.660]   and I'm picking on the guys right now,
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.900]   she's telling you, the adulterous woman is telling you
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.260]   as sincerely as she can that she follows her own hormones,
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.700]   her own desires, her own lust, her own drunkenness
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.180]   and love over the will of God.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.620]   And she's committed to it.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:05.540]   And if you marry that person, and that person goes
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.900]   outside the marriage, how can you blame them?
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.620]   They told you they would.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.180]   They said that, they were committed to doing that.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.660]   That's what their commitment is to, not to you,
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.700]   but to their feelings and their emotions.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.620]   And the desires of their flesh,
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:25.020]   there's only one way to continue to experience
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.940]   the endorphins of sex outside of marriage,
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.660]   and that's to continue to have sex outside of marriage.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.420]   And when that emotion fades, so does the relationship.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.660]   It says, for your ways are in full view of the Lord
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.380]   and he examines all your paths.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.740]   He examines all your paths.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.220]   Some of you know that's verse 21.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.100]   Some of you know your ways are in view of the Lord,
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.900]   and that's why you have no intimacy with God,
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.100]   because there's too much shame there,
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.340]   and you feel that God's mad at you.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.140]   You haven't read the verses like Romans 8, 1
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.780]   that says there's no punishment for those
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.180]   who have trusted in Christ, or 2 Corinthians 5
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.700]   that says he's no longer counting your sins against you,
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.140]   that God loves you, he's not mad at you if you trusted him,
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.460]   that his son actually died because of the sex you've had,
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.580]   the porn addiction that you've had,
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.860]   the thing that even happened to you, that he died for that,
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.620]   that that went on him so that you can be free,
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.940]   that you don't have to walk in guilt,
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.580]   that the enemy's even winning by pushing guilt upon you,
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.220]   that that's the victory he has on you,
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.700]   that right now, it's not like I'm gonna change
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.540]   and I'm gonna get discipled and I'm gonna learn your word.
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.260]   It's like, ah, I can't believe I did that,
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.300]   and I'll never do it again.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.300]   There's no plan in I'll never do it again.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.300]   Grow in his word.
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.620]   Get to know him and how he loves you.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.780]   Be discipled and equipped.
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.220]   Write the scriptures on your heart.
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.380]   You call yourself a Christian, like, walk.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.420]   A Christian just means Christ follower, follow Christ.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.100]   Follow Christ.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:52.940]   And others of you, as I said already,
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.420]   read that verse that the Lord's,
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.380]   your ways are in full view of the Lord,
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:00.740]   and you don't care, you don't fear God.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.900]   I have a friend that wrote that passage,
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.820]   Samantha Pugsley, or that article, rather,
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.020]   she said this, it's titled,
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.180]   I waited until my wedding night to lose my virginity
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.020]   and I wish I hadn't.
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.380]   She says, unfortunately, I can't go back,
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.420]   this is the last paragraph,
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.180]   unfortunately, I can't go back,
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.380]   but I can give you this message
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.860]   as a culmination of my experiences.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.820]   If you want to wait to have sex until marriage,
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.540]   make sure it's because you want to.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.580]   It's your body, it belongs to you, not your church.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.500]   Your sexuality is nobody's business but yours.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.340]   It's compelling.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.780]   Let me read you two passages
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.380]   and let's just ask some questions.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.740]   First one is 1 Corinthians 6, 18 through 20.
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.420]   It says, flee sexual immorality.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:46.780]   All other sins a person commits are outside the body,
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.300]   but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body.
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.740]   Do you not know that your bodies are temples
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.340]   of the Holy Spirit who is in you,
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.340]   whom you have received from God?
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.740]   You are not your own, you were bought at a price,
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.500]   therefore honor God with your bodies.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.140]   So let me ask you now, and I'm really asking,
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.540]   who does your body belong to?
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:08.820]   I'm asking, who does your body belong to?
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.460]   It seems that the scripture says God, Samantha.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:16.780]   Okay, let me just read another one to you, okay?
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.420]   For my married friends or those of you that will be married.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.100]   1 Corinthians 7, verse four.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:25.140]   The wife does not have authority over her own body,
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.380]   but yields it to her husband.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.660]   In the same way, the husband does not have authority
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.940]   over his own body, but yields it to his wife.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.580]   So who does a married person's body belong to?
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:42.100]   Their spouse, their spouse.
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:46.540]   So your body belongs to two people right now,
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.140]   God first and foremost, and the person that you enter
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.940]   into a covenant relationship with before him.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.540]   That's who your body belongs to, it is not yours.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:58.980]   To do with it as you please.
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.420]   The scripture exhorts you to maintain your sister
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.780]   and to maintain your well,
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.820]   keep it in the confounds of marriage.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:12.700]   The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them,
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.780]   the cords of their sins enhold them fast.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.020]   I'm sorry, verse 22.
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.780]   The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them,
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.260]   the cords of their sins hold them fast.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.580]   This is the lie of sexual freedom.
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.900]   You wanted the freedom to pursue something,
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.420]   and now you can't stop pursuing it.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.980]   I wanted the freedom to look at pornography,
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:29.460]   and now I'm ensnared by it.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:33.180]   I wasn't just led astray by it, I'm stuck in it.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.060]   I wasn't just led astray by him,
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.100]   I wasn't just led astray by her,
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.420]   I'm stuck now in this relationship.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.220]   I can't get out, I love her.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.620]   It is the lie of sexual freedom.
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.580]   Verse 23, for lack of discipline they will die,
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:51.780]   led astray by their own great folly.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:55.820]   For lack of discipline they will die,
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.620]   led astray by their own great folly.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.700]   The other day we just moved into this house we're renting,
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.780]   and new neighborhood, and there's this guy
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.780]   that walks his dogs every evening.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.620]   And just to paint the picture, this is a big dude,
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.220]   like he knows where the gym is,
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.220]   he's kind of, he's got muscles where they should be,
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.260]   a big man, and he's walking these dogs.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.820]   Now here's where it gets peculiar.
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:25.820]   The dogs that he's walking are nine huskies, okay?
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.500]   You know what a husky is, it looks like a wolf?
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.660]   I thought they were wolves, my ignorance.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.820]   I was like, dude, it's in our neighborhood with nine wolves,
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.260]   like we're moving, okay?
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.940]   And so, a husky's a beautiful dog though,
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:40.700]   I mean, blue eyes, like fur, really beautiful dog.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.660]   These are sled dogs, you know, mush dogs, they pull sleds.
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.140]   My girls see them, 'cause there's lots of Disney movies
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.620]   made out of these dogs, and my girls see them
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.500]   and they like run outside, okay?
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.140]   They're like V-line to the dogs.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.740]   At first I'm like, guys, they're wolves, stay back!
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.580]   [congregation laughing]
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.820]   And then he's like, oh no, it's okay, they can pet this one.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:03.260]   I'm like, okay, what about the other ones, you know?
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.580]   What does that mean, they eat children for breakfast?
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.260]   Okay, and so, all's good, so you got my three kids
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.860]   in the midst of these nine huskies
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.460]   in this giant bodybuilder.
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.820]   And then the neighbor's kids, so the house next door,
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.580]   their kids run out as well, they want to see the puppies,
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.020]   vicious wolves, and what they didn't know
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:27.100]   is as they ran out the door, so did their chocolate lab.
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:33.260]   Now I think those huskies wanted to eat that chocolate lab.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:37.900]   They took off, and you know what's interesting?
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.820]   That very strong man was not able to hold them back,
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.500]   for they are sled dogs, and it was really interesting.
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.700]   [congregation laughing]
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.580]   He was like, it was like that dog,
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.620]   that chocolate lab came out, and he was like, oh!
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.500]   And then all of a sudden he's running, you know,
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.300]   like they are in front of him, and he's running,
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.740]   he's like, stop, stop, stop!
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.700]   And all of a sudden he's being led
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.680]   by something that he thought he was in control of,
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.900]   but actually it was in control of him.
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.020]   And some of you, you think you're in control of your heart,
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.260]   and actually you are under its control.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:15.940]   You are under its influence.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.340]   If you look back on your life,
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.980]   you have followed it in and out of tragedy.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:23.460]   In and out of terrible situations.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.820]   In fact, your heart has probably led you
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.300]   into more disaster, some of you, than alcohol.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:32.500]   Its influence in your life is actually stronger
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.500]   than alcohol or any other substance.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.460]   The love that you have.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.160]   And you know what the problem was?
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:43.900]   The problem was those dogs had not been trained
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.840]   in that scenario, and the problem
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.300]   that you came in here with tonight
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.520]   is you have not trained your heart.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.420]   You've trusted it.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.580]   You haven't trained it.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.460]   You've trusted it.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.020]   So my third and final point
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.460]   is changing your thirst.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.540]   For lack of discipline they will die,
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:07.180]   led astray by their own great folly, it says.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.180]   Led astray.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.340]   What led them astray?
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.700]   The monster, the thirst that they had,
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.660]   for she was thirsty.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.460]   She was drinking.
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.380]   If you were here two weeks ago,
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.540]   we talked about the monster.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:19.780]   This is your own foolishness.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:20.940]   This is your own desires.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.820]   This is you following your heart.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.340]   In fact, some of you here tonight,
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.980]   you're so thirsty you'll drink anything.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.180]   You're that thirsty.
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:34.020]   And so let's talk about the most frustrating
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.180]   verse in the Bible.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.420]   You may know what it is.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.380]   Proverbs 4:23.
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:44.020]   I like how y'all just went to write down
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.780]   the most frustrating verse in the Bible.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.220]   Guard your heart for it's the wellspring of life.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.300]   Ladies, guard your heart.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.460]   Don't throw anything at me.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:55.300]   Guard your heart.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.580]   What does it mean to guard my heart, pastor?
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.620]   What are you saying?
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.300]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.660]   Take control of my feelings and emotions?
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.180]   Am I supposed to lock 'em up?
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.300]   Can't let anybody see it?
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.540]   Okay, your guy's unsafe.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.780]   Guard your heart.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:11.660]   You might fall in love with him 'cause he helped you.
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:12.940]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.980]   What does it look like to guard my heart?
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.500]   First of all, I wanna apologize on behalf of the church.
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.820]   Pastors have taught this verse out of context for years.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.740]   And I wanna show you what it actually means.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.300]   To guard your heart for it is the wellspring of life.
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.980]   From everything out of life flows out from your heart.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:33.580]   That means your heart pursues what you give it,
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.700]   what you show it, what you continue to put in front of it.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.860]   That's what it learns.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.380]   It has pattern recognition.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.940]   It learns, it says, this is what I want.
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.620]   This is what I want, this is what I want.
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.460]   Why, you're like, hey, why, I can never date a good guy.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.180]   I always date these dirtbags.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.740]   That's because you've taught your heart to love dirtbags.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.860]   That's why.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.940]   I can never date a good girl.
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.860]   You know, I just, I always like these girls
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.660]   that are no good for me.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.500]   What do you do on the weekend?
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.100]   Oh, sometimes I go to the strip club.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:46:59.980]   You look at porn?
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.220]   Cool, you've taught your heart to want a porn star, okay?
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.180]   That's what you've trained your heart to look for.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.260]   That's what I want.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.180]   You've trained your heart for that.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.580]   You've conditioned it.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.580]   Woody Allen, when he married his stepdaughter,
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:16.660]   came out with the famous quote,
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.380]   the heart wants what it wants.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.460]   And I would tell you, no, the heart wants what it's fed.
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:23.540]   The heart wants what you tell it to want,
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.500]   what you train it to want.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.620]   And you're like, well, how am I training?
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.420]   So what does it mean to guard my heart
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.580]   when I'm alone with a guy and we're at the coffee shop?
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.740]   How do I guard my heart?
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.740]   You guard your heart long before that.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.900]   Okay, stop watching trash.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.940]   Stop saying, hey, this is the kind of guy I want,
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.620]   a six pack and a doctor.
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.460]   You know?
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.940]   Nothing against the medical society, I'm just saying.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.860]   Like, stop, you're like, hey, this is what I want.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.420]   You can retrain your heart
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.940]   to actually pursue the right things.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.180]   Stop telling your heart, hey, I want a big busted porn star.
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.220]   That's what I want.
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.100]   I want a girl who will get naked for money.
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.860]   That's what you've trained your heart to do.
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.980]   And you're like, that's ridiculous.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.900]   No, it's not.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.180]   It's what you,
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.100]   Satan has convinced you it's ridiculous.
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.540]   The one who speaks lies,
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.100]   the accuser has told you it's ridiculous
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:20.380]   and you're living it.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.900]   You're so blind, you don't even see it,
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.820]   that you're addicted to this sex outside of marriage.
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:28.500]   And you're like, but I'm gonna be a great husband.
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.980]   No, you're not gonna be a great husband.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.740]   But I'm gonna be a killer mom, I'm gonna be a great mom.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.580]   No, you won't, 50 Shades of Grey.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.580]   No, you won't.
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:43.060]   You're gonna be a bad mom.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.780]   And I know that's so hard to hear.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.940]   But it's true.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:55.100]   Unless right now, tonight, you calibrate your heart.
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.540]   You tell it what to love.
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:00.340]   You tell it what to pursue.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.180]   You show it where to go.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.540]   What's the application?
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.660]   I'll give you a really fun application.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.060]   You ready?
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.620]   If you're gonna date, and I would really redefine dating,
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:13.980]   I'm not saying kiss it goodbye or anything,
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.860]   I'm just saying redefine it
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.180]   according to what the scripture says.
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.020]   Well, how do I do that?
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.660]   You learn this book, okay?
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.460]   And you read the parts of it that are about relationships.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.300]   First Peter three, Ephesians five,
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.940]   stories in the Old Testament.
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.100]   You look what God desires for a man and woman
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:31.940]   when they spend together.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:32.940]   Well, dating's not in there, okay?
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:35.100]   Well, dating, well then we really need to redefine it then.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.460]   It's not in there.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.700]   Because God's told us everything we need to know in here.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.700]   I think his intentions were actually
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.140]   that you would fall in love,
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:46.940]   that you would be drunk in love one time for a lifetime.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.780]   That's crazy, JP, you sure?
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:52.740]   I think the world's statistics right now are crazy.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.380]   I think the world's track records are crazy.
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.060]   I think the fact that you've bought into their way
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:00.420]   over God's way is crazy, ludicrous, foolish.
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.180]   That's what I think.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:06.740]   In 2005, there was a,
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:13.300]   video was actually one of the most watched clips of TV.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.580]   It was Tom Cruise on Oprah.
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:16.460]   Anybody see this?
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.060]   Talk about being drunk in love.
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.220]   I think we got a picture.
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.540]   There he is.
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.820]   Tom Cruise on Oprah.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:28.660]   If you haven't seen it,
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:29.820]   I'd encourage you to watch this clip.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:33.060]   Watch this instead of reading the Beyonce, Jay-Z lyrics.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.300]   It's on YouTube.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.140]   Tom Cruise on Oprah, couch, we'll pull it up.
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.780]   I mean, he's acting crazy.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.300]   And so this is why it went viral,
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.340]   because the dude was acting crazy.
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:47.380]   He had just started dating Katie Holmes,
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:49.660]   who was 17 years younger than him.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:53.580]   He had just divorced his wife.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.740]   He's having illicit sex with a woman
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.580]   who's 17 years younger than him,
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.540]   and he's on Oprah acting a fool,
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.100]   saying, "I'm in love, Oprah."
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.700]   Jumping up on the couch, he kept doing this,
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.180]   he did that like 16 times.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.100]   Saying, "I'm in love, Oprah."
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.540]   He's like, "I've never seen you like this."
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:09.740]   And he's like, "That's because I've never felt this way."
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.740]   And there was a woman, I had lunch yesterday
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:17.740]   with one of the leading marriage pastors in the country,
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:21.100]   and we were talking,
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.660]   and we were talking about that clip specifically,
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:23.700]   and he said, "Yeah, there was a woman
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.420]   "that came into my office,
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.940]   "and I was counseling her around her marriage,
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:30.260]   "and she just said, 'I wish my husband loved me like that.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.700]   "'I wish he was drunk in love.'"
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.980]   In fact, my friend said he's never seen a marriage last
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.180]   between two people who have followed their emotions
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.900]   throughout their lives.
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.660]   And the leading determiner,
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:44.940]   whether they would get married or not,
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:46.020]   is how they felt.
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.780]   You just know, you know, and you just know.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:49.780]   You ever heard that?
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.540]   And so this woman says,
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.180]   "I wish my husband loved me like that."
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.540]   And he said, "Are you kidding me?
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:57.940]   "Do you know that's the fifth time
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.220]   "he's never felt that way?
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.620]   "Do you know that he just divorced his wife
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.820]   "and is now having illicit sex
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.980]   "with some girl who's 17 years younger?"
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:09.740]   He says, "Hey, if you wish your husband loved you that way,
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:14.460]   "I just want you to watch how that turns out, okay?"
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:19.020]   If you don't know, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes,
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.420]   they're divorced today, tragic divorce.
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.260]   Didn't last.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.620]   And it won't last for you either
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.060]   if you follow your feelings and emotions
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.860]   above everything else.
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:28.700]   JP, what do I do?
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.340]   I can tell you, I see a lot of marriages.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.580]   I know which last, which don't.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:33.340]   It's all pattern recognition,
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.740]   or so much of it is anyways.
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:39.620]   You date someone who is fully committed to God.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:40.540]   That's the application.
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.540]   I told you I was gonna give you a fun application.
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.900]   If you're gonna go on dates,
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.140]   if you're gonna date someone,
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.580]   you find people who are fully committed to God.
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:50.300]   A girl who has been discipled,
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.700]   a guy who has been discipled,
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.300]   a guy who has yielded to the Word.
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.140]   And so what I'm saying, you're like,
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.380]   "Wait, you're confusing me."
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.380]   I mean go on dates with.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.100]   If you're gonna date, okay,
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.540]   and if you're gonna go on dates anyways,
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.460]   go on dates with the people who love God the most.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.620]   What if I'm not attracted to 'em?
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.780]   Who knows, you might grow attracted to 'em.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:10.340]   But isn't attraction important?
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.900]   You better be able to cherish your wife.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.460]   You better be able to love your wife.
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.820]   You better be able to tell her
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.900]   how beautiful she is truthfully.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.060]   That's important, absolutely.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.060]   Okay, but it may not come on day one.
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:25.700]   So you may need to retrain your heart what beauty is.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.740]   You may need to retell your heart
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.420]   and show your heart again
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.780]   to stop looking for the porn star, guys.
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.820]   And to start looking for the girl who knows the Word
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.820]   and is ready to change the world for the sake of God
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.340]   and she'll follow you anywhere.
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.540]   And she's a part of his army.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:43.460]   And she'll go to war with you, man.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.460]   And she's out there like,
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.340]   "I just, where's my stool, man?
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.500]   "I'm gonna sit down, we're way over on time.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:53.300]   "I'm gonna talk to you guys.
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.900]   "Let me just shoot you real straight, okay?
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.620]   "It's a real talk, family time.
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.900]   "Fort Worth, glad you're with us.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:01.300]   "Fort Worth is tuned in too.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:05.900]   "Guys, I'm gonna talk to you guys for a second.
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:08.020]   "I'm sad for us.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:11.420]   "I'm real sad for us, guys.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.020]   "Like, I look at statistics.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:17.460]   "Can I just tell you guys, I'm talking to men,
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:18.900]   "you're way outnumbered here.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.700]   "If you look around, like, there are,
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:24.260]   "I'm just shooting you straight based on my observation.
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.460]   "There are so much more solid girls here
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.820]   "than there are solid guys.
[00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:31.060]   "As far as how many girls here or how many guys here,
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.620]   "I don't know, but I promise you,
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.500]   "there are way more solid girls here than there are guys.
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:39.580]   "And the reason, guys, is because you have grown addicted
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.700]   "to the wrong things.
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:44.100]   "You have trained your heart to look for the wrong things
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.620]   "and to pursue the wrong things
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.900]   "and to ask out the wrong kinds of women.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.580]   "And you have to calibrate your heart
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.820]   "to tell it what to pursue,
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.460]   "to stop following emotions and lusts of the flesh.
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.580]   "You're setting yourself up for disaster, man.
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:04.460]   "And ladies, I want you to be patient.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:07.500]   "God, you be patient.
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.100]   "I'm not gonna give you an if/then statement.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:12.140]   "You may be patient and you may die in your patience.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.100]   "I don't know what else to tell you, okay?
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:14.940]   "That may happen.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.500]   "I don't wanna jack with your heart and say,
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:20.140]   "well, if you hold out and you wait for the perfect one,
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.260]   "God's gonna give 'em to you when you're least looking,
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.460]   "He might do that.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.340]   "He sometimes does.
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.780]   "I've seen Him do that a lot.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.180]   "But ladies, don't sell out.
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:32.460]   "Like in so many ways, you determine the value of sex.
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.860]   "And when you devalue sex,
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:37.180]   "the reason that guys go for cheap sex
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:39.180]   "is because you made it cheap.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.060]   "So many of you have.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.220]   "And you've given away your bodies.
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:44.380]   "You've left nothing to the imagination
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:46.980]   "by what you wear, how you dress, how you act.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:49.780]   "And the Bible says that you're to dress in such a way
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.820]   "that you do not bring attention to yourself.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.700]   "But often, when you stand before the mirror,
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.660]   "your number one motive is,
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.460]   "how can I bring attention to me?"
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.460]   And that's not trusting God.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.540]   And so you hold out for that guy.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.260]   You wait for that one.
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.420]   You train your heart.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:06.500]   Let me tell you something.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.980]   If you're listening to Drunk in Love by Beyonce,
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:12.220]   you have been really foolish with your heart.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:15.860]   You have trained it to look for the wrong things,
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.220]   and it's going to set you up for disaster.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:20.020]   And I know, but listen,
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.380]   no one has ever accused me of being a legalist.
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.260]   So that's not my intention,
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:27.500]   so I'm not trying to put big rules on you.
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:28.900]   I'm just saying, you need to be careful
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.580]   what you let your heart long for.
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.380]   Hear me?
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:34.220]   We good?
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.780]   All right?
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:38.740]   Guys, if you're here and you're solid,
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:41.020]   would you multiply your kind?
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.660]   Like, if you're here and you know the Scriptures,
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.140]   I need you to start making disciples quickly.
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.180]   All right?
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:48.660]   'Cause there's like two of you.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:50.140]   (congregation applauding)
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.380]   You know, every lady in the house is clapping.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.700]   And I'm serious, guys.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.140]   Like, if you, and there's more than two of you.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.420]   That's not fair.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.700]   There's a handful of you.
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.980]   There's like at least 12.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:04.220]   I need you to start multiplying your kind.
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:06.780]   If you know the Scriptures, if you know God,
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.140]   like, stop wasting your singleness,
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.780]   and start pouring into the lives of others
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.820]   so that they would know God, too,
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:13.860]   so that they would follow Him.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:16.620]   Because I think it would be a great legacy of the porch
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:18.900]   is if we created, if God, through us,
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:21.860]   produced healthy marriages that produced healthy children
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.740]   who were also disciples.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.580]   And so it's this simple.
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.540]   Be a disciple, date a disciple.
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:30.020]   Not someone who goes to church.
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:32.420]   Who doesn't go to church in Dallas, right?
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:35.740]   Be a disciple, date a disciple.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:36.580]   What's a disciple?
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:38.020]   Someone who has been poured into,
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:41.100]   someone following Jesus, someone who knows the Word,
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:44.700]   someone who's committed to walking in it and living it out.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:45.740]   Not someone who checked the box.
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:46.940]   I'm a Christian, okay, great.
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.140]   Match.com, you're a Christian, we're good.
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.420]   No, a disciple.
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:52.260]   Let me pray.
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:56.340]   As I pray, the shane's gonna come up
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.380]   and sing a song over us.
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:58.780]   I just want you to sit and reflect.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.580]   There's heavy stuff tonight.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:04.820]   Some of you, you know you've gotta make some changes.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.940]   I'm not mad at you if you've trusted in Christ
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.140]   for the forgiveness of your sins.
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.860]   God's not mad at you.
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.380]   But there is a war that is being waged in you.
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:17.740]   And the enemy's winning in so many of you tonight.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.620]   And I'd love to flip the script.
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:24.180]   I'd love to change that before you leave.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.820]   That you would surrender your life to Christ.
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.500]   That you would trust that God pinned your sins
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.340]   to a piece of wood on his son, Jesus.
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:36.860]   That he killed him in your place.
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.900]   That he received your punishment so that you don't have to.
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.700]   God, thank you for that truth.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.740]   It's an incredible thing that the most terrible event
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.940]   of the gospel is the most, or the scriptures,
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.340]   is the most beautiful event of the scriptures.
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:56.640]   That a bloody cross is an empty tomb.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:02.180]   Father, thank you for the work that you've done
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.380]   in our hearts and in our lives.
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:07.620]   And Father, just as we read over your scriptures,
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.020]   the ones that are of you,
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.660]   I pray that my friends in Dallas
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:11.820]   and my friends in Fort Worth,
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.640]   that their hearts would be connected and stirred
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.340]   and that they would live that out in their cities.
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:18.300]   And the ones that, anything that I said,
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:19.420]   that's just wisdom for me
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.100]   and not consistent with who your spirit is.
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.620]   I pray they forget it before they stand up.
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:25.980]   But regardless, God, I pray we'd leave changed.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.420]   Thank you for the truth of who you are
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:29.260]   and the way you love us.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:32.120]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.620]   (music fades)
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:37.120]   (music fades)
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.620]   (music fades)
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:49.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
