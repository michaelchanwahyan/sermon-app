[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:26.280]   All right, all right.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.280]   How are we doing tonight, porch?
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.000]   Let's go.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.520]   Hey, I want to welcome everybody tuning in online,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.560]   all of our Porch Live locations around the nation,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.320]   Porch Live Boise, Idaho, Indianapolis, Indiana,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.960]   the Porch Live Tulsa, Des Moines, Midland, Texas,

[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.080]   Hey, I got a question before we get going.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.040]   What do you want to do before you die?
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.560]   Like your bucket list.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.000]   Like if you had a bucket list or you don't have one,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.560]   now's your chance to make one.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.220]   OK, what do you want to do before you--
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.240]   it's called bucket list because it's
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.120]   what you do in life before you kick the bucket of life.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.640]   So what's on your bucket list?
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.920]   Come on, it's not rhetorical.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.320]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.040]   Rocky-- skydive.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.120]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.320]   Well, what else?
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.480]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.120]   Go where?
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.280]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.760]   Launch?
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.760]   Go to launch, she says.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.720]   OK, what else?
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.720]   Go to Europe.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.760]   Go to Europe.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.160]   Go to Israel, the holy land where Jesus walked.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.800]   I've always wanted to do that.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.640]   What else?
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.760]   Get married.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.240]   Get married, she says.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.920]   Come on.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.440]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.200]   Hey, that's a noble want.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.400]   The Bible says he who finds a wife finds a good thing.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.320]   He who finds a husband finds a good thing.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.800]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.360]   What else?
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.920]   Anyone else?
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.520]   What do you want to do before you die?
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.040]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.320]   Backpack through Europe.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.440]   Go to all the NFL stadiums.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.600]   OK, big NFL fan in the house.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   Go to all the national parks.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.120]   Go to all the national parks.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.720]   I love that.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.680]   I love that.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.000]   Here's what's on my bucket list.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.380]   Here's what's on my bucket list.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.880]   What?
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.960]   Flash mob.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.640]   Flash mob.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.280]   OK, we might be able to make that happen one night.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.120]   All right, here's what's on my bucket list.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.840]   I want to sleep in an overwater bungalow in Bora Bora.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.960]   Go to Fenway Park and watch the Boston Red Sox play.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.960]   I want to walk my--
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.720]   all my Texas Ranger fans out there,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.520]   we're on a four-game losing streak.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.600]   Tonight, they're going to break it.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.360]   I want to walk my daughters down the aisle
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.080]   if the Lord would have them get married.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.080]   Thank you.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.960]   Thank you.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.720]   I want to zip line in the Amazon rainforest,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.240]   go on an African safari, backpack through Europe,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:11.320]   run with the bulls in Spain, run a marathon, and go skydiving.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.560]   Isn't that what the great theologian Tim McGraw said?
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.480]   Right?
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.960]   He wrote a song called "Live Like You Were Dying" back
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.120]   in 2004.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.560]   And I think he was onto something.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.640]   Something in that song resonates with us.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.240]   We know that to be true, but sometimes we just
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.600]   don't believe it, and we don't really live from that truth,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.040]   live like we were dying.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.760]   I remember not too long ago getting an unexpected phone
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.000]   call from a good friend of mine.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.600]   And he said that your roommate from college died.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.560]   And I remember going to the funeral,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.600]   and my teammates at the time all showed up, myself included,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.720]   played college baseball.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.240]   And I just remember these guys were at the funeral,
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.080]   and these guys that I'd watch over and over every weekend
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.440]   party, and I was part of it BC days before Christ.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.960]   And I just remember watching just the funeral play out,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.400]   and then we would get together after,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.120]   and we were just talking about just spiritual things,
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.720]   like things that we had never talked about before.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.760]   And I saw these men just contemplating life in a way
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.960]   that I never saw them contemplate life.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.080]   And I start there tonight, because I'm not really
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.160]   telling you anything new.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.560]   Like, you know that.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.840]   But I think sometimes we just need the quick reminder of,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.920]   hey, this life isn't all that there is.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.400]   Like, we're going to die.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.200]   Like, 10 out of 10 people are going to die.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   Nobody's escaped that.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.040]   And so tonight, we're pulling up on a familiar passage
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.320]   of scripture, if you've studied the scripture at all,
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.120]   which Solomon would say kind of in Ecclesiastes 7.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.720]   He's going to say it's better to go to a funeral than a party.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.600]   And so it's where we contemplate death.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.720]   It's where we start to live with a new perspective,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.760]   this perspective that the Bible would say is wisdom.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.560]   It's where we start to think about what's
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.280]   really important in our lives and why we were created.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.560]   James says it like this in James 4:14.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.200]   He just says, "Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.920]   What is your life?
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.680]   For you are a mist that appears for a little time
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.160]   and then vanishes."
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160]   This past week, I was in the yard mowing.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.360]   And I have a 2 and 1/2-year-old.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.480]   And my 2 and 1/2-year-old, his name's Caleb.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.000]   And we were just out.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   You know, he's got the little Fisher-Price mower.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.600]   And he's mowing behind me.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.080]   And we're just doing our thing, you know, father like son.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.800]   And I'm doing some yard work.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   It's kind of what I do.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.560]   I Sabbath with my hands because I always work with my mind.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.600]   And so we're out there.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.920]   And all of a sudden, out of the corner of my eye,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.000]   I'm in the garage just getting something.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.520]   And he's on the edge of our driveway,
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.160]   practically in the street.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.480]   And I remember seeing, as I looked--
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.920]   and I was about to call his name--
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.920]   a car just came flying down the street.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.600]   And I'm like, oh, no.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.280]   I think my son's life has just flashed right before my eyes.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.080]   And I know that car didn't see him because as he passes--
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.600]   he's on the edge of my driveway, practically in the street,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.760]   from about-- from where I'm standing to where
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.960]   that screen is right there.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.960]   It's just, you know, about 3 feet, 4 feet at the most.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.520]   This car passes by.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.720]   And it almost hits my son.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.440]   And I share that with you tonight because in that moment,
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.560]   it just gave me a perspective that I didn't have.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.080]   It allowed me to see that this life is but a vapor.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.560]   It's here a little while, and it could be gone for my son.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.720]   And so what do you do when you have that perspective shift?
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.960]   What do you do when wisdom begins to invade your heart?
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.200]   You look up the Texas Rangers schedule, and you say, hey,
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.280]   I'm going to take my son to a Texas Rangers game,
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.440]   even though he's 2 and 1/2.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.560]   So we pull up Sunday afternoon.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.640]   We go to Rally House.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.120]   We get him a jersey.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.360]   I get some, you know, Texas Rangers swag,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.920]   and here we are at the game.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.880]   And what is he holding in his hand?
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.520]   A foul ball that your boy caught.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.640]   I'm like, that's crazy.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.720]   Like, that's-- I'm 40 years old.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.840]   And I've never caught a foul ball.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.520]   And it's almost as if God was just saying, hey, life is short.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.000]   Live it.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.640]   And that analogy, it breaks down because it's not
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.920]   about Rally House and getting them the Corey Seeger jersey.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.640]   What's up, Corey?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.200]   Come on, baby.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.040]   You can come to the porch any time you want.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.520]   But it's not about that jersey.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.280]   It's not about the game because all those things are temporal.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.840]   But when Caleb almost got hit from the car, God gave me--
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.400]   He had me draw closer to him in my worry and my stress.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.560]   And he started using that pain for his purpose,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.160]   for me to draw closer to him.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.400]   As I laid in bed that night just worried about my son,
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.480]   you know, concerned about what if he really did get hit.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.600]   And God uses those moments in our life to draw us close to him.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.480]   So how do you gain that kind of perspective in your life?
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.280]   Because let's be honest, in the room tonight,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.000]   you're not going to get this-- most of us
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.080]   aren't going to go to the doctor and get a diagnosis
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.500]   that you have a few months to live
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.840]   or almost get hit by a car and get taken out.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.400]   Like, that's not just-- that's not really
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.320]   how it works for most of-- maybe for some.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.200]   But for most of us, it's subtle, right?
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.560]   It's things like this.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.320]   For example, he seems like a good guy,
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.080]   seems like someone you want to take home to mama.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.800]   But then you find out he's a creeper.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.720]   Is that nervous laughter?
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.560]   It seems like the job of your dreams.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.740]   You interviewed for it, and you got the job.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.780]   And you're texting your friends, and you're like,
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.920]   I'm never going to have to work a day in my life.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.400]   And you pull up in your power suit and your power tie,
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.000]   and you're ready to go.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.840]   Four months later, you're like, ah,
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.560]   it's not what I thought it was.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.960]   I need to start looking for another job, right?
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.440]   It seemed like sex was a really good idea.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.600]   I thought he was the one.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.080]   I thought she was the one.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.600]   And then you're left with brokenhearted perspective.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.640]   And wisdom begins to invade your heart and your mind.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.440]   And as Christians, I'll just start out here.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.180]   Followers of Jesus Christ, we should be the wisest people
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.840]   in the room, because we have a direct line to the creator
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.280]   of the universe through the word of God, his Bible,
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.160]   that he's preserved for centuries.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.960]   Like I always say, that God's word is God's voice.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.600]   And so if you don't have a Bible tonight,
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.960]   let me just shameless plug, you can stop by the welcome desk
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.600]   on your way out.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.000]   That's a free gift to you on us, because we want
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.320]   you to get into God's word.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.900]   That's where we're going to be tonight.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.600]   We're going to be in Ecclesiastes 7.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.100]   If you have your Bibles, we're going
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.000]   to read from the wisest man who ever walked this earth,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.160]   other than Jesus.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.440]   Solomon has this unique encounter with God
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.520]   in 1 Kings 3 and 2 Chronicles 1.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.280]   God shows up to Solomon, and he says,
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.440]   hey, you can have whatever you ask for.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.080]   Can you imagine that?
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.480]   Can you imagine God saying, hey, you can have whatever you want.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.400]   You can have that girl.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.360]   You can have that job.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.680]   You can have a billion dollars.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.680]   You can have that house.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.600]   You can have that car.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.760]   Anything you want.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.480]   So what does Solomon say?
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.600]   God, I want wisdom.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.720]   True story.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.640]   Historical account.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.840]   And so he begins to run this experiment for his life
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.320]   where he gets all the wisdom.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.000]   God just pours the wisdom out on him.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.280]   He begins to be one of the richest men ever.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.160]   Look it up on Google.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.760]   Like $2.1 trillion was his net worth.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.560]   And he begins to have these amazing parties.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.080]   And he's got 1,000 wives and 300 concubines,
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.420]   like live-in girlfriends.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.360]   The Playboy Mansion is at his house.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.000]   And he runs this experiment.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.640]   And he tries everything under the sun.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.520]   We learned a few weeks ago that under the sun
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.760]   means apart from God.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.400]   And he comes up short.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.760]   And tonight, he's going to show us
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.560]   how to gain an eternal perspective, that we would
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.680]   loosen our grip on this life.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.080]   And he would teach us that this world is not our home.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.520]   Let's dive in.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.800]   Ecclesiastes 7, verse 1.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.160]   "A good name is better than precious ointment."
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.680]   Another translation says, "A good reputation
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.960]   is more valuable than costly perfume."
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.680]   I could literally spend the entire night
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.640]   talking about this one verse.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.840]   Like it will preach, man.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.560]   And so he's saying, hey, that your reputation is
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.680]   better than costly perfume.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.680]   Perfume is something that, in that culture,
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.600]   that you would put on.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.240]   It's still something that you put on, ladies, right?
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.520]   To make you more attractive.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.120]   How?
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.000]   By the way you smell.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.160]   And so don't miss this.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.440]   You know what Solomon's saying?
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.240]   That something's better than your attraction.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.160]   It's your character.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.400]   It's your reputation.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.560]   It's my first truth tonight.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.600]   To gain an eternal perspective, we have to believe--
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.040]   you have to believe that character is better than
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.840]   charisma, if you're taking notes.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.360]   Character is better than charisma.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.360]   We have to believe this.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.040]   If you don't leave with anything tonight,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.000]   this is the one thing you should latch onto.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.160]   That good character is better than charisma.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.520]   Ladies, you would be a woman that
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.880]   would find a man that has really, really good character.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.800]   Not just really good charisma and can woo you and tell you
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.440]   what you want to hear and whisper
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.880]   sweet nothings in your ear.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.320]   Men, that you would look for a woman that
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.720]   has incredible character and the reputation
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.400]   follows her character.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.440]   That when you ask the people around her who she really is,
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.520]   that they would tell you that she's a woman of character.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.320]   There's a lot of good looking dudes out there,
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.600]   but they're ready to ruin your life.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.240]   Some of them are right here tonight.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.080]   They're in this room, and they carry Bibles.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.360]   You think I'm playing?
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.160]   It's the phrase, they're wolves in sheep's clothing.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.920]   They might even know some Bible verses.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.560]   They do.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.360]   Take it from him.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:49.680]   They might even be in a community group,
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.280]   and they will wreck your life.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.080]   They will ruin you.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:00.080]   Same is true for women.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.720]   Solomon reiterates this truth later on in this chapter
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.560]   in verse 26.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.640]   I find more bitter than death.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.920]   Solomon, what's more bitter than death, bro?
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.760]   The woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap,
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.400]   and whose hands are chains.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.120]   The man who pleases God will escape her,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.040]   but the sinner, she will ensnare.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.360]   You know what he's saying there?
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.320]   He's describing a woman who is a snare
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.040]   and tries to trap guys with her body, with her smooth words,
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.160]   with manipulation.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.720]   We talk about this a lot here, Proverbs 31, 30,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.240]   and all the women roll their eyes, but it's true.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.560]   It's not any less true.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.440]   And I don't share this to shame you.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.600]   I just share this as, hey, this is a great standard
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.640]   to run to.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.160]   Not that you're going to be perfect,
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.600]   but it just says charm is deceitful and beauty is vain,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.960]   but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.000]   That's what you're looking for, a woman of good character,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.720]   a man who loves Jesus more than his sin, amen?
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.680]   And so, so many of us men,
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.880]   let me get off the women for a minute.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   We sit around and we use our thumbs to go after,
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.080]   you know, kingdoms that are fake and false realities
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.160]   and these video games, and we just sit there
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.120]   and act like we're accomplishing something.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.600]   Nothing wrong with about video games.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.560]   I'm not here to have a tiff with video games,
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.760]   but so many of us, we never engage
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.160]   in the real battle at hand,
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160]   that there's heaven and hell, that there's evil and good,
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.680]   that there's a conquering King and Jesus
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.920]   who came on a rescue mission,
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.120]   died on the cross for your sin,
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.320]   rose again on the third day to defeat sin and death.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.440]   And some of you spend more time investing
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.720]   in false realities on a video game
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.760]   than you do investing in that kingdom
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.400]   that's gonna last forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.900]   (congregation applauding)
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.840]   And so tonight, like, what are you living for?
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.640]   What are you after?
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.200]   Here's my word of caution with online dating.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.400]   It's not a moral issue, it's not right or wrong,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.860]   but just be careful.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.840]   Never trust a profile because profiles lie.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.600]   You hear that all the time up here,
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.560]   but we're out for your good.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.220]   Trust their character, not their charisma.
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.000]   Don't trust their smooth words.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.400]   Watch and observe.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.080]   Dating is for observation and edification
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.000]   that you would observe their life over a period of time.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.100]   What should you observe?
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.360]   Here's some things to observe.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.520]   Do they keep commitments even when it hurts?
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.400]   Do they cut corners at work when no one's looking?
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.300]   Do they rationalize sin and make excuses for it?
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.940]   Do they spend their 20s and 30s serving others
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.620]   so that they can come to know Jesus?
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.260]   Do they use their time to know their Bible
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.480]   and memorize scripture?
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.260]   Is anyone investing in their life?
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.980]   If no one is investing in their life,
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.980]   if they don't have a mentor or somebody to disciple them,
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.220]   do not date them, point blank.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.600]   That is a red flag if I've ever seen one.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.540]   Like if no one is investing in their life,
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.260]   if they're not investing in other people's lives,
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.260]   it's a two-way street.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.900]   You have someone discipling you
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.720]   and you pour that out to other people
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.620]   who need to be mentored and discipled.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:23.220]   Are they secure with who they are in Christ?
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.900]   Are they constantly looking for the world to affirm them?
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.420]   What are their hearts feeding on?
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.740]   The heart wants what the heart wants.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.580]   No, that's not true.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.780]   The heart wants what you feed it.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.940]   What are they feeding their heart?
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.780]   And so that is how you test, is this woman,
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.180]   is this man a man of character?
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.460]   Are they just a man of charisma?
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.500]   Do they have woo?
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.440]   But it falls short when the rubber meets the road.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.540]   God says he wants us to have a good name,
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.340]   meaning he wants us to become more,
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.220]   become men and women of nobility and righteousness.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.820]   He doesn't want to just bless us, he wants to change us.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.380]   Like T.A. talked about last week,
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.340]   he wants us to grow up in Christ
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.520]   so that we reflect his image.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.860]   We were created in his image.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.820]   In the image of Christ, he created us, male and female.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.340]   Reflect his image wherever you go.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.580]   How does God bring about this change?
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.980]   How does he build character and produce a reputation
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.900]   worth following?
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.580]   Through pain and suffering.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.960]   What did he just say?
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.580]   Through pain and suffering.
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.420]   Here we go.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.260]   Second part of verse one, we just made it through one,
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.140]   not even, but we're moving.
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.860]   He says this, "And the day of death," what's better?
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.500]   "The day of death than the day of birth."
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.340]   What does he mean?
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.420]   It's like he's talking in code tonight.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.340]   Like we need to take a deep dive
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.260]   and discover the truth of scripture.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.580]   He's saying, hey, the day of birth and the following days
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.740]   is when you discover your character and your reputation,
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.620]   but the day you die is when your character
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:01.000]   and your reputation are fully revealed in totality.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.820]   Like, you know what you, you know, going to a funeral
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.560]   and there's people that usually get up on stage, right?
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.700]   Or they get up in front of that funeral
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.180]   and they begin to say nice things.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.400]   And, you know, there's people that nod
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.380]   when they say nice things.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.540]   And then when people say nice things,
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.680]   there's people that know that they're lying.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.140]   You've been there.
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.980]   I've been there at those funerals.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.040]   And you're like, man, what they're portraying
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.620]   is not how that person really lived their life.
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.500]   What do you want to be tonight?
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.880]   What are you pursuing?
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.000]   He goes on and says in verse two,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.280]   it is better to go to the house of mourning
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.520]   than to go to the house of feasting.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.360]   Know what he's saying there?
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.880]   It's better to go to funerals than parties.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.580]   For this is the end of all mankind.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.120]   Everyone is going to die, he says.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.160]   And the living will lay it to heart.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.400]   Sorrow is better than laughter for by sadness of face,
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.200]   the heart is made glad.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.840]   For sadness is pain, he's saying,
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.640]   has a refining influence on our life.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.220]   He goes on and says the heart of the wise
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.800]   is in the house of mourning,
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.260]   but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.120]   In other words, a wise person thinks a lot about death
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.440]   while fools only think about having a good time.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.900]   Sometimes a funeral is better than a party, he says.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:20.740]   Why?
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.020]   Because pain makes you real.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.940]   Pain gets your thinking straight.
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.940]   Pain allows you to see that you weren't made for this world.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.100]   You were made for another world.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.080]   Pain refines you, it shows you what's important.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.400]   It's an important part of the process.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.240]   Why?
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.640]   Because good times can fool you,
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.380]   which is my second spiritual truth tonight.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.840]   To gain an eternal perspective,
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.500]   we have to believe that good times can fool you.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.480]   I was talking to a friend of mine
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.360]   who is the chaplain for the Dallas Mavericks,
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.560]   and he was doing a chapel service for the Indiana Pacers.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.200]   And he was just sharing about God
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.940]   and through the person of Jesus Christ and eternity.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.800]   And someone on the Indiana Pacers just blurted out,
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.760]   "Bro, what does this have to do with me?"
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.980]   Like just point blank.
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.800]   And he just said, "Hey, you gotta be quick on your feet
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.680]   "'cause you never know how people
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.700]   "are gonna respond in that room."
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.940]   And he looked at me and just said,
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.940]   "Hey bro, you have everything the world offers.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.420]   "You have fame, you have status, you have money,
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.760]   "you have cars, you have houses, you have women.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.000]   "You have everything the world offers.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.040]   "Everything is at your fingertips.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.860]   "But there's still something.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.760]   "Everybody has something.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.580]   "Everyone's not perfect.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.220]   "Everyone's going to die.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.120]   "Everyone's gonna stand before their creator
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.440]   "and they're gonna have to give an account
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.680]   "for that thing in their life.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   "What's your thing, bro?"
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   You know what he was saying?
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.160]   He literally was saying good times can fool you.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.920]   Good times can keep you from trusting in God.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.280]   Because everything is going well for you.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.160]   You don't need God.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.720]   You're doing pretty good on your own.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.960]   Plenty of people in America face this reality
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.860]   that everything's good.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.880]   And when it's not, they numb themself with a drink
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.480]   or a drug so they don't have to deal
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.720]   with the reality of pain.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.000]   To which this Indiana pacer just said,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.580]   "My thing is women.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.640]   "Thank you."
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.760]   And they just engaged in this incredible dialogue
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.960]   in the middle of chapel.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.120]   And it was just a beautiful moment
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.240]   where he's ministering to this guy
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.400]   that has everything at his fingertips.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.000]   But he knows he has that thing.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.240]   He knows that that's not right.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.920]   He knows that doesn't end well for him.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.000]   Proverbs 14, 12 says, "There's a way that seems right
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.520]   "to man, but that way ends in death."
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.840]   What's your thing tonight?
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.600]   That if you go throughout your life
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.240]   and you leave that thing unchecked,
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.800]   it's not gonna go well for you.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.480]   See, I can go and preach at a bar,
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.460]   but no one's gonna listen to me
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.320]   because they're laughing and they're having a good time.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.160]   I can go preach at a funeral and I have a captive audience.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.340]   People are focused on the things of eternity.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.480]   They're open to the reality of God.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.440]   They're open to the reality of the gospel,
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.280]   the life, the death, the burial,
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.120]   and the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.320]   Every funeral is a reminder that one day you're gonna die,
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.480]   that each of us have an expiration date
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.960]   and only God knows when that is.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.860]   The wise person also recognizes the benefits of pain.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.700]   It humbles you.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.200]   It gives you a sobering reality about life.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.920]   It says, "When a person's face is sad,
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.440]   "the heart may be happy."
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.260]   Why?
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:55.260]   Because that pain has taught them some things about life,
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.920]   that there's more that meets the eye,
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.240]   that pain is a reality for all of us
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   because we live in a broken world, cursed by sin.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.740]   And so all suffering is a result of the fall, sin.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:15.960]   Pain is the best teacher we have outside of God himself.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.160]   C.S. Lewis said it like this,
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.020]   "Pain is God's megaphone for a deaf world."
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:21.860]   Why?
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.200]   Because it wakes us up from our sleeping slumber.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.320]   The mentality that the Christian life
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.160]   is all about health, wealth, and prosperity,
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.700]   and God's gonna bless you,
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.440]   and it's not wrong to pray for healing.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.680]   It's not wrong to pray for blessing.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.300]   It's just wrong to believe that's always God's best for you.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:46.480]   And so tonight, where are you at?
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.380]   I know that there's young adults in this room
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.700]   and all across the rooms that are occupied
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.800]   through the Porch Live locations
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.420]   and people listening online at a later date
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.620]   that are dealing with some really hard things in their life,
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.980]   painful things.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.640]   And God wants to use that to refine you,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.180]   to cause you to depend on him,
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.980]   to strip you of the things that you think
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.940]   are gonna give you life
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.040]   and give you satisfaction and fulfillment.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.460]   I was thinking earlier today
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.660]   just about some of the pains in my own life.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.580]   The first real pain I experienced
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.780]   was when I found out my parents
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.020]   were getting a divorce at a young age.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.160]   When I didn't make the basketball team in high school,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.860]   white men can't jump, that's true.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.100]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.460]   Well, maybe some of you can.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.600]   When my high school crush broke up with me,
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.760]   now you can laugh, it's cool, it's beyond me.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.820]   It's behind me, I should say.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.500]   When I found out that my roommate from college passed away.
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.500]   When I was 30 and still not married.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:00.900]   When my sister-in-law got a life-threatening
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.940]   colon cancer diagnosis.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.780]   When I found out that our first child
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.420]   might have a genetic disorder.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.560]   When my son Caleb almost got hit by a car.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.620]   And I get it, like we can compare lists
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.900]   and I don't think that's always helpful
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.660]   because there's some things going on in this room
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.100]   that like your list pales.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.460]   Or my list pales in comparison to your list.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.300]   And that's not the point of this.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.580]   The point of this is just you saying,
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.940]   "Hey, there's pain.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.340]   "There's pain in your life, there's pain in my life."
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.260]   And God wants to use that pain
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.220]   to cause a deeper dependency on him.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.580]   Pain is God's megaphone to a deaf world.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.860]   Could it be that the pain you have experienced
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.040]   and are experiencing is there for your good in God's glory?
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.540]   Last time I stood up on this stage,
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.060]   I quoted a verse in Romans 8, 28.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.860]   It just says, "God causes all things, good or bad,
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.620]   "to work together for the good of those who love him
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.520]   "and called according to his purpose."
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.500]   And I believe that God is gonna cause
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.220]   whatever's going on in your life,
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.740]   whatever has happened to you,
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.700]   for your good and for his glory.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.300]   And for people to look at your pain
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:21.060]   and watch you run to Christ,
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.320]   not to things of the world.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.540]   And they're gonna take notice
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.100]   and they're gonna begin to ask questions
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.540]   and they're gonna begin to be curious about your God.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.580]   I believe that's true for some of you in this room.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.980]   I pray that's true for some of you in this room.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.340]   Verse four.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.540]   The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.340]   He just keeps punching this.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.140]   He keeps throwing this out
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.400]   as if we didn't get it the first three verses.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.320]   The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.820]   but the heart of the fools is in the house of mirth.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.380]   In other words, a wise person thinks a lot about death
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.940]   while a fool only thinks about having a good time.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.920]   To gain perspective, you have to believe it's good.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.580]   To gain an eternal perspective,
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.580]   you have to believe that God is using your good times
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.020]   and your bad times to refine you
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.320]   into the man and the woman he wants you to be.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.880]   The mind of the fool is wasting their years
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.020]   at some bar looking for a temporary high.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.360]   The mind of a fool is in the house of feasting,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.180]   in the house of pleasure, the next party, the next drink,
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.500]   the next purchase, the next toy they're gonna buy,
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.140]   the next restaurant they're gonna go to,
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.020]   the next vacation they're gonna take,
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.540]   the next person they're gonna date,
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.580]   the next whatever it is, fill in the blank.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.700]   And then your life is over and you stand before your creator
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.900]   who gave his life for you on the cross.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:53.300]   Verse five, it is better for a man to hear the rebuke
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.600]   of the wise than to hear the song of fools.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:02.700]   Proverbs 27, six just couples this verse really, really well.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.000]   It just says this, wounds from a friend can be trusted,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.780]   but an enemy multiplies kisses.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.140]   To gain an eternal perspective,
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.500]   you have to believe point number three,
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.640]   wounds from a friend can be trusted.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.020]   The mind of a fool only hangs out with people
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.060]   who will tell them what they wanna hear
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.580]   versus tell them what they need to hear.
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.220]   We talk a lot about community here at The Porch
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.220]   because The Porch is Watermark Community's
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.660]   young adult ministry.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.860]   Community is in our middle name.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.700]   We believe that the men and women
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.380]   that you hang out with is important.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.560]   Show me your friends and I'll show you your future.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.120]   This idea that, hey, who are your people?
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.560]   Who do you run to?
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.680]   Have you ever had someone you really respect
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.480]   say, hey, we need to talk.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.760]   It's that, hey, we need to talk.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.080]   And like on the other end, you're like,
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.640]   oh dear, what did I do?
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.880]   Like what happened?
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.400]   And they pull up a seat at the table
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.480]   and they begin to look at you
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.120]   kind of like those piercing eyes.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.720]   And it's really someone you respect.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.260]   Maybe 80% of the room, you probably like,
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.900]   yeah, I've had this happen to me
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.180]   and it didn't go well, bro.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.780]   Okay, well, let's talk about that, we will.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.220]   But for the 20% of us, right,
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.460]   who maybe has had that happen in a way
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.060]   where that person began to point some things out,
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.180]   we call them blind spots in our life
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.420]   that we can't see, but maybe they can.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.740]   And they're things that are inconsistent
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.580]   with the character of Christ.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.560]   And so they begin to share some things
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.000]   about our life that just aren't adding up
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.760]   to what we say we believe through our actions.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.160]   They just don't line up.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.780]   Those things aren't congruent.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.980]   I've had it happen to me.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.160]   Actually, I have it happen to me
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.360]   almost every Friday morning
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.520]   when I get together with my guys at 6 a.m.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.840]   You know what happens sometimes in those moments?
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.760]   I'm like, can we just go have a drink?
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.560]   Can we just go have a drink,
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.260]   just share a beer together and not worry about this?
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.980]   Can we just go to North Park Mall
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.900]   and buy a new pair of clothes?
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.620]   Like, can we just plan the next vacation?
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.940]   Can we just go eat some good food, bro?
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.900]   I don't really care for you to look at my life
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.420]   and start pointing things out
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.620]   that are inconsistent to the character of Christ
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.560]   and how I talk to my wife at times
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.660]   and how I'm sharp-tongued with my kids
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.940]   and the lust that I have in my heart.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:28.060]   And it doesn't feel good.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.600]   And I wanna hit the easy button.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.780]   I wanna hit reject.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:36.220]   But I know that Proverbs 27, six is so true.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:41.780]   That wounds from a friend can be trusted,
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.320]   but an enemy multiplies kisses.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.760]   And I know that if I just go to people
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.080]   that just wanna suppress the areas of my life
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.740]   that really aren't consistent with the character of Christ,
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.960]   I know that I will never be God's man.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.080]   And so I just ask,
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.600]   like, where are you today with your community?
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.640]   What does that look like for you?
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.880]   And if you don't have it,
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.400]   then I'm pleading with you through the text,
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.300]   through the word of God, that you would find that.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.440]   Because sometimes instead of receiving a good rebuke,
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.100]   we run to the songs of fools instead.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.960]   We're like, Bruno Mars, will you teach me?
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.880]   He's been locked out of heaven, right?
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.640]   Why are we gonna listen to him?
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.560]   We're like, what about T Swift?
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.800]   She's still got bad blood
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.440]   because band-aids don't fix bullet wounds.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.740]   You know, like, what are we doing?
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.520]   And it's like Amy Winehouse,
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.380]   like she says, don't go to rehab,
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.560]   which is pretty sobering because she didn't go to rehab
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.820]   and she's not here today.
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:53.040]   And that's not so funny because it's true.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.740]   And so we run to these,
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.360]   the song of fools it says at the end of verse five.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.220]   And we wonder why our life is still on the crazy train.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.940]   And we're not getting off of it.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.320]   And we keep doing the same things over and over,
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.760]   expecting a different result.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.440]   And culture would just say,
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.120]   that's the definition of insanity.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.640]   And so tonight you have a chance.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.440]   Every single week, there's a team of people down front.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.260]   There's next steps in the loft
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.160]   that you can go and say, hey, I just,
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.720]   I'm tired of suppressing my sin.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.200]   I'm tired of not having the right people in my life.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.360]   The men that I'm running with
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.840]   are really not pointing me to Christ.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.240]   The women, they just, you know,
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.120]   want to talk about things that don't really matter
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.000]   for all of eternity.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.680]   And I know I'm not really being God's woman
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.480]   and God's calling me to step up.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.120]   God's calling me to grow up.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.920]   God's calling me to run to people who are going to wound me
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.960]   and be faithful in that.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.260]   And listen, I know there's people in this room
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:56.180]   that have tried community.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.620]   And listen, people have, you've confessed some things
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.580]   and they've mismanaged information about you.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.940]   And I am sorry.
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.140]   That is not the church.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.160]   That is not from God.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:14.080]   Like this should be the safest place on the planet
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.760]   to be real and to confess sin to.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.460]   Amen?
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.160]   If this isn't the safest place,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.280]   then where are we going to go?
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.040]   And if that's been your experience, I'm sorry.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:25.880]   And I want to talk to you.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.680]   We want to talk to you and we want to help you find
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.040]   the people in your life that you can do that with.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.000]   Verse six, "For as the crackling of thorns under a pot,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.480]   so is the laughter of the fools.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.840]   This also is vanity."
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.760]   This is just what he's saying.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.520]   "Like thorns, they burn fast and they make a loud noise.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.520]   At this time, you would cook your food under kindling
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.840]   and there would be thorns and they would burn fast
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.060]   and they would make a noise."
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.980]   And he's just saying, this is what fools do.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.960]   They just laugh off their sin.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.360]   They're just like, "Ha ha ha, you know,
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.660]   I don't really don't have a drinking problem.
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:03.840]   Ah, you know, listen, man, it's just a little bit of porn.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.320]   It's not really going to matter."
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.440]   All the while, you know that that two-dimensional image
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:14.240]   that you keep running back to is only feeding variety
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.520]   in your life so you never love one person alone.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.320]   And the repeater cheater in you is just going to come out.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.120]   And listen, anytime you have a lustful desire,
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.320]   you're just telling the person you're dating,
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.480]   "Hey, I'm an adulterer.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.560]   I'm just waving my hands right now."
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.580]   Because an adulterer is someone who does something
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.640]   with someone else who is not their spouse.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.060]   And you're just waving your hands up in the air saying,
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:37.960]   "Hey, I'm an adulterer.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.640]   I'm just letting you know right now that if we get married
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.200]   and I have a lustful thought, I have a lustful desire,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.320]   I'm going to do the same thing that I trained myself to do
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.720]   when I was single and when I was dating you."
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.840]   That's what you're telling them.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.860]   And you keep saying, "Hey, this is going to be the last time."
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.380]   And there's just broken promises after broken promise
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.480]   that you make to your special someone that you're dating.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.320]   And you know what?
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.360]   You're still living in the same crap.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.240]   There, I said it.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:10.740]   (audience applauding)
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.660]   And listen, I'm not here to shame you.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.960]   I was a porn addict for a decade of my life.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.880]   But at some point you draw the line in the sand,
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.080]   you nail a stake in the ground,
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.780]   and you said enough is enough.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.600]   I'm done.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.520]   I'm done being that guy.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.240]   I'm done being that girl.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.160]   And I'm going to run to Christ and his people.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.880]   And right there, I'm going to find a safe place
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.720]   to be God's man and to be God's woman.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.040]   And so you don't just laugh it off.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.240]   It's not just no big deal.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.600]   It's not, it's going to be fine.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.520]   No, it's not going to be fine.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.840]   Your life is a train wreck.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.040]   Get off the crazy train.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.260]   Who are your friends who will faithfully wound you
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.720]   and say, "It's not fine.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.160]   "Enough is enough."
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.840]   Verse seven, "Surely oppression drives the wise
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.440]   "into madness and a bribe corrupts the heart."
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.480]   It just says, "Exhorting people for power and wealth
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.980]   "turns wise people into fools."
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:12.560]   The mind of a fool just says, "Hey, what's in it for me?
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.080]   "It's all about what's in it for me.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.000]   "It's hey, if you can do for me what I want,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.560]   "then I'll be your friend."
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.200]   Where are your friends that just love you for who you are
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.120]   and not what you can do for them?
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.160]   Like they love you enough, not just to,
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.000]   if there's sin in your life, they're going to call it out,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.780]   but they're going to say, "Hey, I'm going to walk with you
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:36.780]   "through this pain, this sin, this hardship.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:41.160]   "And I'm not going to bail when everyone else around me
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.760]   "says it's okay."
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.440]   Just not, "I'm going to stick with you.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.660]   "I'm going to walk with you.
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.480]   "And if you keep falling, I'm going to help,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.400]   "I'm going to help pick you back up."
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.020]   Where are your friends?
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.180]   Where are those people?
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:01.420]   Verse eight, "Better is the end of a thing
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.820]   "than its beginning.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.880]   "And the patient in spirit is better
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.580]   "than the proud in spirit.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.360]   "Be not quick in your spirit to become angry,
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.820]   "for anger lodges in the heart of fools.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.780]   "Say not, 'Why were the former days better than these?'
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.900]   "For it is not from wisdom that you ask this."
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.320]   It just says, this is what he's saying.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.280]   Finishing is better than starting.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.120]   Patience is better than pride.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.840]   Controlling your temper for anger labels you a fool.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.320]   It's saying in the context of maybe life
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.880]   not working out the way you want it,
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.600]   don't mock God, don't flip God off.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.740]   God's doing something in the pain.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.280]   Don't get angry at God, get angry at sin.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.280]   Get angry that sin is the result of suffering.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.600]   And the fact that every time we suffer,
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.080]   you can remember that this world is not our home.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.900]   It's saying, "Hey, this is not wise.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.700]   "God, why aren't you working in my life like you did before?
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.420]   "Why am I struggling financially?
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.460]   "What with my job?
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.240]   "Why did that person die?
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.340]   "Or why does that person have to go through cancer?
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.960]   "Why am I still not married?"
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.360]   To gain perspective, you have to live with the end in mind,
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.000]   which is my last spiritual truth.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.420]   Live with the end in mind.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:20.680]   I'm discipling a guy named Tanner,
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.680]   and I'm excited because he just got engaged.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.360]   And it's been a long time coming.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.160]   I've been walking with him for some time,
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.680]   and I'm about to do his wedding in October.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.200]   And I love this brother, like he's my boy.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.840]   And we get to meet every other week,
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.140]   and the weeks that we don't meet, we just do life together.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.440]   And I texted him this,
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.920]   just in light of his wedding coming up.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.260]   And I just said, "Hey, bro, what is louder?
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.100]   "The beginning of something or the end of it?
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.540]   "The beginning always makes more noise.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.920]   "Weddings are big, loud, and fun.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.960]   "I will love you faithfully until the end of your life
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.960]   "as the music is playing.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.100]   "You and Lauren are gonna make a beautiful couple,
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.600]   "but let's check back in 30 years
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.960]   "after y'all have hurt each other and cried,
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.720]   "raised some kids, Lord willing,
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.920]   "and each gained about 40 pounds.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.880]   "Hopefully not, right?
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.920]   "But life gets lifey, bro."
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.760]   Emojis.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:24.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.280]   I should just put the text on the screen.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.720]   I went on and I just said,
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.540]   "Hey, I guarantee the end won't be as loud as the beginning,
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.700]   "but it's sure a lot more important.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.260]   "The end of the matter is more important than the beginning
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.080]   "because the beginning is all talk.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.900]   "I love weddings and I can't wait to officiate y'alls.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.960]   "But what's even better is when you see an older couple
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.380]   "in public holding hands, sitting close,
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.000]   "opening the door for his bride, kissing, why?
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.120]   "Because they're being faithful to the end."
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.200]   There isn't a lot of fluff, it's just glorious.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.040]   The beginning is just words.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.380]   Vows are good, but they're just good intentions
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.860]   of what you think you will do.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.040]   It's a whole lot better to actually make it to the end.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.320]   Praying that you too will continue
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.400]   to fall more in love with Jesus so you make it to the end.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.160]   Can't wait to celebrate y'all on your wedding,
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.060]   but even more so 30 years from now.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:18.760]   Commitment.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.900]   That's what he's saying here.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.800]   How are you gonna be a man or woman of commitment?
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.060]   You live with the end in mind.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.160]   How do you do that?
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.640]   You need to start with where you hope to end up.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.640]   All commitments start with the end in mind.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.120]   Know where you are and know where you wanna be
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.800]   and get your community together
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.260]   and let them help you game plan for where you wanna go.
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.600]   For where you wanna go.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.460]   It's your path, not your promises,
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.260]   that take you to the place that you end up, you know that?
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.680]   Live with the end in mind.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.840]   I'll close with this.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.460]   From time to time, I like going to cemeteries.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:03.140]   And yesterday morning, I just, I started the week off
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.960]   and I grabbed another guy in my discipleship group
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.180]   and we went out to a cemetery close to my house.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.820]   I get it, it's morbid because it is, okay?
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.840]   But what I love about going to cemeteries
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.860]   is it just begins to refine your perspective.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.840]   I mean, even me, I mean, I get it.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.880]   I'm not, I don't want you to prop me up
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.740]   to an unhealthy place.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.500]   Like, man, I'm fleshly, bro.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.700]   Like there's things in me that, man, are just not of God.
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.580]   And I need God to refine those.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.260]   And there's times when I just wanna live
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.300]   with a temporal perspective and not an eternal one.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.140]   And so I get out of my car
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:45.140]   and the first grave that I walk up to had this on it.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:51.420]   That's my last name, Jones.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.260]   Go to the next pic.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:00.220]   Okay, don't go to the next pic.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.020]   But, oh, there it is.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.700]   And there's a cross right behind it.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.780]   And it was as if God was saying, "Hey, Josiah."
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.100]   And I get, man, I think about the brevity of life
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.860]   all the time, I'm a pastor.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.620]   But even in that moment, I needed to be quickened
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.900]   to the reality that this place is not my home.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.500]   And God just began to sober me up
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.900]   and he began to show me things in my life.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.220]   You might ask, "Well, what does that mean, sober you up?"
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.980]   Frustration and anger when things didn't go my way
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.940]   last week.
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:34.020]   Quick-tempered with my wife to respond in a way
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.120]   that isn't helpful and isn't loving.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.220]   Sharp tongue with my kids.
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.040]   Wishing I made more money.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.260]   People would recognize me more,
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.820]   that I would have more fame and more status.
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:51.100]   And it was just sickening things that God began to reveal
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.340]   as I'm walking from grave site to grave site,
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.700]   tombstone to tombstone.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.620]   And I'm looking at the dates and I'm looking at
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.140]   what people say about these people's lives.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.260]   And there's people that live for a day
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.660]   and live for 100 plus years.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:11.460]   But even in 100 plus years is a vapor.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:15.080]   It's here a little while and then it's gone.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:20.140]   And what it began to do is sober me up to the reality
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:24.440]   that, "Man, what do I want my life to be about?"
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.500]   And I began just to write things out in my notebook
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.020]   and just say, "God, thank you for revealing this to me.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.920]   "I needed this.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.060]   "Shared this with my community.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.300]   "Went home and talked to my wife, Kathy, that night
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.320]   "and just said, 'Hey, will you forgive me
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.480]   "'for the way that I've come across this past week
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.380]   "'with my anger and my words and my tone?
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.420]   "'Got my kids in the living room
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.120]   "'and sat 'em on the couch, my six, my four
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.440]   "'and my two and a half year old.'
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.280]   "And I just said, 'Hey, you've seen Daddy not at his best.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.420]   "'Will you forgive me?'"
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.640]   That's what it does.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.020]   When you live with the end in mind,
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.700]   when you don't just go through life
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.960]   thinking that this life is all that there is.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:11.400]   Solomon's just saying in closing,
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.260]   "Live with the end in mind.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.420]   "Embrace the pain we experience.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.700]   "It's gonna grow wisdom in us."
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.940]   What if your character is shaped by,
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.460]   God, every time pain enters your life,
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.780]   then you're a guaranteed success
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.220]   that you're gonna look more like him.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.080]   That's what God's after.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.160]   God loves you and sometimes has to use pain
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.660]   in showing you that death is not far off
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.140]   to get your attention,
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.100]   to let you know that he's God and we're not,
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.820]   to let you know that there's something outside of the sun,
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.280]   S-U-N, there's the sun, S-O-N,
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.040]   that came on a rescue mission for you and me
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.620]   over 2,000 years ago.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.960]   He didn't see fit to leave us in our sin.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.660]   So there's no other message out there like it,
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.540]   that God left the comforts of heaven
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:45:59.940]   for our cross here on earth
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.460]   so that we could be made right with him.
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.940]   Our sin separates us from a holy God.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.900]   And when he hung on that tree,
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.860]   he bridged the chasm of separation.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.340]   The Bible says for the wages of sin is death.
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.380]   He died the death that you and I were supposed to die.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.660]   He lived the life that you and I could never live.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.460]   He was perfect in thought and word and in action.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.340]   No other person has claimed that,
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.120]   which made him the only eligible one to die on the cross
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.380]   for your sin and my sin.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.260]   And on the cross,
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.660]   he soaked up every last ounce of God's judgment and wrath,
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.940]   the wrath and judgment that should be poured out
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.020]   on you and me.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.620]   And he got what you deserve and you get what he deserves.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.180]   It's called the great exchange.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:50.620]   And he says, now the ball is in your court and my court.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.020]   What will you do with Jesus?
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:56.660]   How will you respond to the greatest message
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.780]   in human history?
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.420]   That he didn't just stay dead in the grave,
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.900]   that three days later,
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.300]   scripture says in history records
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.440]   that he bursted forth from the grave
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.740]   to defeat sin and death.
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.380]   And now he gives you wisdom
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:13.180]   to navigate through this thing called life.
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.780]   In a culture that is hostile to the things of God,
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.120]   you have a guide, you have wisdom,
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.200]   you have life at your disposal.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.340]   How will you respond?
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:29.140]   What will you make this life about?
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.900]   Will it be about you or will it be about him?
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.520]   This message never gets old
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.800]   and God will stop at nothing, even pain,
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.080]   to try to get your attention
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.360]   so that you see and believe this message.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.680]   It's the greatest message in the world
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.360]   that man can be forgiven and united with his creator.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.920]   Let me pray that you are.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.800]   Let me pray that you will tonight.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.280]   Let me pray that you will see and have a perspective
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   that is eternity driven.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.080]   God in heaven,
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.920]   I pray that the sound of my voice,
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.680]   that there wouldn't be a man or a woman in this place
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.480]   that wouldn't know you,
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.400]   that wouldn't see you tonight,
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.920]   that would love you
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.400]   and that would bend their knee if they don't.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.400]   And that you would meet them in their sin
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.200]   and in their destruction.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:23.880]   And God, you would forgive them and make them whole,
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.080]   not through their work,
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.920]   but through your work on the cross
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.880]   and through your work on the cross.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.280]   And through that God,
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.640]   we would begin to walk and live and move and breathe
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.960]   and make decisions from your wisdom,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:43.160]   from the wisdom that you gave Solomon
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.680]   in the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.760]   God, would you have your way in this place?
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.040]   Would we be free to worship now?
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.440]   Would we be free to sit and ponder?
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.880]   Would we do whatever you are calling us to do?
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.040]   Would we not leave this place
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:03.120]   and just go about our life and not leave changed?
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.560]   Christ, in we pray, amen.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.560]   Amen.
