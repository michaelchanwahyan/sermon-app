1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,160
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,740
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,040
 - Well hey Dallas, hello Fort Worth,

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,160
 how y'all doing tonight?

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,120
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,680
 Yeah, it is good to be with the porch on a Tuesday.

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,600
 I always love it, even when I'm not here in body,

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,880
 I am here in spirit.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,360
 I love to be with my friends,

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,240
 and we're gonna dive in and we're gonna learn something.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,820
 I think you're gonna look at a part of the Bible tonight

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,540
 that is probably as crucial and essential for you

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,320
 as people that I believe are the hope

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,240
 of our future generations, our country.

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,240
 We need you to understand what I'm gonna teach tonight.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,800
 If you are just making your way here tonight

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,760
 for the first time in a while,

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,920
 we're making our way through Matthew's chapter five,

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
 six, and seven.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,440
 We're calling it Summer on the Mount,

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,040
 and we are studying what this guy named Jesus said

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,500
 the very first time he broke onto the scene.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,080
 And he is breaking what had been 400 years of silence,

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,840
 of not hearing any word from God.

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,680
 The people were without God and without hope in the world,

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
 and they had done what men always do,

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,180
 they created for themselves some system

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,840
 that they would basically base their righteousness on,

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,880
 and that they would make themselves feel good

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,480
 about themselves and at peace with themselves.

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,520
 And then here comes God saying,

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,040
 "You can try and convince yourself

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,540
 "that you have found the way to peace,

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,260
 "but there is no peace apart from me,

36
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,160
 "the Prince of Peace, the King of Peace.

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,900
 "And there's been no peace in this world for a long time

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,120
 "since you tried to find life apart from me."

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,020
 And so here comes God in his kindness,

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,400
 not looking to chew us out,

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,220
 not looking to read us a riot act,

42
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,560
 but he starts with these amazing words.

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,960
 He says, "Man, you want it to go well with you?

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,440
 "You wanna be blessed?

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,240
 "I'm your creator, I'm your Father, I'm your loving God.

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,080
 "I want you to be blessed, so tune in."

47
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,560
 He starts by telling them they're gonna be blessed

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,800
 if they understand that left to themselves

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,680
 and their own strength and their own way,

50
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,800
 it's never gonna go well with them.

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,000
 They're not gods, they're not perfect,

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,880
 they're not infinite, they're not omniscient.

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,760
 And so acknowledge what you lack,

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,380
 and I will give you what you need.

55
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,420
 What a great way for it to start.

56
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,500
 When we started this little series

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,620
 called Summer of the Mount,

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,220
 I had the chance to walk you through

59
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,540
 those first few passages,

60
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,660
 and I talk about how many have said this view of God

61
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,980
 that he's gonna show up, he's gonna wear us out,

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,700
 he's gonna tell us all the things we've done wrong

63
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,460
 and how we better get it right or we're in trouble.

64
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,540
 Now he does get to that in this text,

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,640
 but what he's really doing is he's trying to say,

66
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,920
 "I'm not mad at you,

67
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,840
 "I just wanna know if you're sick and tired

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,180
 "of being sick and tired,

69
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,820
 "and I'm here to offer you a better way,

70
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,320
 "and by the way, this same Jesus said,

71
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,140
 "I am the way, I am the truth, and I am the life."

72
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,040
 Now it's crazy when you go to the Bible

73
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,240
 to try and figure out how you should live

74
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,500
 or how you should respond,

75
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,040
 if you aren't careful with this book,

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,320
 it's gonna screw you up.

77
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,200
 It's gonna mess you up.

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,920
 Because you might come to it with a sense of,

79
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,180
 "Hey man, if anybody ever quotes to me

80
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,600
 "something from the Bible,

81
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
 "I better respond to it quickly and fully."

82
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,160
 Now that is not in and of itself a bad idea

83
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,280
 as long as you understand that this is a difficult book,

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,000
 and sometimes untaught and unstable people

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,620
 take it and distort it to their own destruction.

86
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,780
 That's the Bible's words, not mine.

87
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,360
 You find that warning in 2 Peter,

88
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,160
 one of the guys that was closest to Jesus,

89
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,120
 one of the guys that Jesus said,

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,460
 "You're gonna be the foundation of the beginning

91
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,820
 "of the grace that I'm bringing,

92
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,340
 "Peter, you and others like you who know who I really am,

93
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,340
 "that acknowledge that I'm a God,

94
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,820
 "that I am the God, and that I'm good, and I am the way.

95
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,980
 "You better make sure when you teach people what I said,

96
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,400
 "you teach them all of what I said.

97
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,560
 "You teach them everything I commanded you."

98
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,680
 'Cause if they just take little pieces of it,

99
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,300
 it will not go well with them.

100
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,280
 Let me just show you a few things.

101
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,300
 You know what the Bible tells you and says,

102
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,100
 in it there is no God?

103
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,940
 It says that.

104
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,140
 You know what the Bible says in it,

105
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,820
 and some people in this room believe

106
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
 that if you really know God and you love him

107
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,980
 and you let yourself be strengthened by him,

108
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,380
 you can do anything that you want.

109
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,280
 You know what the Bible says?

110
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,280
 That if you give, it is guaranteed that what you give

111
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,920
 will be multiplied and made beyond anything

112
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,140
 you ever imagined.

113
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,840
 You know what the Bible says?

114
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,560
 That you are not to judge other people,

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,840
 or you'll be judged.

116
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,720
 You know what the Bible says?

117
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,760
 That God guarantees for you a future and a hope.

118
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,780
 He's got plans for you for welfare and not calamity.

119
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,760
 Now here's what's crazy about what I just said.

120
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,600
 Some of you guys go,

121
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 "Man, he's quoting some of my favorite Bible verses."

122
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,760
 (congregation laughing)

123
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,360
 And to you, I say, "Whoa."

124
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,800
 About 10 years ago, I did a series

125
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,740
 with a bunch of my friends.

126
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,060
 We call it The Most, where we just took a bunch

127
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,400
 of different verses in the Bible.

128
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,280
 I talked about what I thought was the most important verse,

129
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,380
 the most misquoted verse.

130
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,060
 I talked about what I thought was the most misunderstood

131
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,880
 verse in the Bible.

132
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,020
 I did about 10 of these.

133
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,460
 And tonight, we are at the place in the Sermon on the Mount

134
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,560
 when more people take a verse and jerk it out of context

135
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,920
 and use it to the destruction of themselves and society

136
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,580
 than any place else in the Bible.

137
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,380
 In fact, just a good thing to remember

138
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,180
 as we get charged in tonight,

139
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,340
 is that you should never read a Bible verse.

140
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,360
 You hear what I said?

141
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,380
 I'm a pastor, and I'm telling you,

142
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,100
 you should never read a Bible verse.

143
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,100
 What you should read is a Bible passage.

144
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,580
 What you should read is books in the Bible.

145
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,340
 What you should read is the story.

146
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,380
 Now watch this, turn with me to Matthew chapter seven.

147
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,260
 That's where we are.

148
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,960
 Now you can do that thanks to a guy named Stephen Lankton.

149
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,420
 You might go, "Well, Todd, who is Stephen Lankton?"

150
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,580
 He was the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1227.

151
00:06:52,580 --> 00:07:00,060
 1227, that is about 1200 years after the Bible,

152
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,200
 actually about 900 years after the Bible was assimilated

153
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
 for the very first time.

154
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,980
 A guy named Stephen Lankton made it easy for me

155
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,540
 to communicate to you who might be on anybody's wildest

156
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,680
 imagination one day, have your own copy

157
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,060
 of the sacred text of God.

158
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
 And so that you would get there quickly,

159
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,720
 he put chapters on letters and books.

160
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,540
 You see, when they were written,

161
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,860
 they weren't originally written with chapters.

162
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,620
 And in fact, it wasn't until a couple hundred years later

163
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,980
 that a guy named Nathan, who was a Jewish rabbi,

164
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,100
 went and took Stephen's chapters

165
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,380
 and put inside of them verses.

166
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,460
 And because of Nathan, some of you might believe

167
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,420
 that you could be silent and never speak up

168
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,260
 because God will fight for you.

169
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,500
 Because you read Stephen Lankton's chapter 14

170
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,420
 and Nathan's verse 14 in Exodus.

171
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,060
 And you read a Bible verse.

172
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,580
 And that Bible verse says,

173
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,980
 "Hey, your God will fight for you.

174
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,820
 "You just stay silent."

175
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,380
 And because some of you guys have obediently lived out

176
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,940
 that verse, and because churchmen have obediently lived out

177
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,940
 that verse, we live where we live today in 2015.

178
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,340
 It was about another 300 years after Stephen Lankton

179
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,860
 that a guy named Estienne, also known as Stephanus,

180
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,100
 took Stephen Lankton's chapters

181
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,180
 and inserted verses into the New Testament.

182
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,900
 What I'm telling you is that there was never a Bible verse

183
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,420
 that was written.

184
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,940
 Books were written, thoughts were written,

185
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,980
 and you have to be careful

186
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,000
 to not pull certain verses out of context.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,260
 Let me do this for you very quickly, all right?

188
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,900
 I said at the very beginning that the Bible says

189
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,860
 that there is no God.

190
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,220
 This is the easiest one to disprove.

191
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,380
 It comes from Psalm 14, verse one.

192
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,140
 It also comes from Psalm 53, verse one.

193
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,460
 What it actually says is,

194
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,740
 "The fool has said in his heart, there is no God."

195
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,900
 Obviously, with just a little bit more reading

196
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,380
 in the passage, you would find out that, of course,

197
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,740
 the Bible doesn't think there is no God.

198
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,780
 How about this one?

199
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,460
 I talked about the fact that God has plans for you

200
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,540
 for welfare and not for calamity,

201
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,860
 but to give you a future and a hope.

202
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,740
 That is some of our favorite Bible verses.

203
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,260
 Some of you guys got that tattooed on your bad self.

204
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,820
 I know you do, right?

205
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,140
 (congregation laughing)

206
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,700
 You're like, "I don't really know much about God,

207
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,380
 "but, you know, welfare and future hope, man,

208
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,340
 "not calamity.

209
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,340
 "I'm down with that God," right?

210
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,940
 So look, find verse.

211
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,020
 What you don't know about that verse

212
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,900
 is it comes after a couple of other ideas.

213
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,860
 And this is what it starts with in verse 10.

214
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,660
 He's talking to Israel specifically

215
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,140
 that God uniquely chose to show Himself with.

216
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,780
 And He says, "Look, I'm gonna send you

217
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,700
 "for 70 years in a timeout.

218
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,320
 "I'm gonna whoop you and basically not protect you

219
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,020
 "and not bless you for 70 years.

220
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,520
 "And so you better go and set up shop in Babylon,

221
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,700
 "learn the language, improve their public school system,

222
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,000
 "work on their sewer system,

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,720
 "do what you can to make Babylon a decent place

224
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,300
 "'cause you're gonna live there for a while,

225
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,840
 "but I'm not gonna forget you.

226
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,400
 "And I know the plans I've got for you.

227
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,280
 "It's what I told you a long time ago."

228
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,460
 And to that nation, He tells them,

229
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,460
 "Look, I have plans for welfare for you

230
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,280
 "and not for calamity.

231
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,340
 "I'm gonna come to you.

232
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,920
 "I'm gonna give you a future and a hope."

233
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,040
 Now listen, does that verse in some way,

234
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,100
 can you extrapolate that truth to you and I at some level?

235
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,880
 Yes, but it doesn't mean

236
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,120
 that it's gonna happen in your lifetime.

237
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,240
 I mean, the Bible in fact says this.

238
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,860
 It says that if you desire to live godly in Christ Jesus,

239
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,820
 you will be persecuted.

240
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,940
 The Bible says, "Why are you surprised

241
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,760
 "at the fiery ordeal among you?"

242
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,220
 The Bible says, "You wanna follow me?

243
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,620
 "Then you're gonna be hated like I was hated.

244
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,100
 "Don't be surprised."

245
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,180
 And you kinda go, "Looking for a future and a hope, man.

246
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,920
 "That's why I got in on Him with Jesus.

247
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,140
 "This is not what I thought would happen, man,

248
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,100
 "when folks would call me a bigot and intolerant."

249
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,900
 And we said, "Well, you're not reading your Bible right."

250
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:30,600
 Philippians 4:13, "If you don't have Jeremiah 29 11 tattooed

251
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,220
 "on you, Johnny Manziel, you've got Philippians 4 13

252
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,280
 "tattooed on you."

253
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,620
 And it tells you that I can do all things

254
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,620
 through Him who strengthens me.

255
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,780
 Man, that's a great verse.

256
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,420
 What that verse is talking about is because in your lifetime

257
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,620
 you're not gonna have all welfare and future hope

258
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,080
 that there's gonna be some calamity.

259
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,620
 You better learn that there's a God

260
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,540
 who's sovereign over all things and that He's good

261
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,380
 and that you can trust Him.

262
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,660
 And so this is what it says in Philippians.

263
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,960
 Paul's writing says, "I rejoiced greatly in the Lord

264
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,500
 "that alas, now you revived your concern for me.

265
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,960
 "Indeed, you were concerned with me before,

266
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,000
 "but you lacked the opportunity

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,460
 "because everything was cool and good with me.

268
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,180
 "But then when it really got hard,

269
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,920
 "when things got tough, you guys showed up."

270
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,180
 And then he says this, he says, "Not that I speak from want

271
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,580
 "'cause I've learned to be content

272
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,280
 "in every circumstance I'm in.

273
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,000
 "I know how to get along with humble means

274
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,800
 "and I also know how to live in prosperity

275
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,260
 "in any and every circumstance.

276
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,320
 "I have learned," he goes on to say,

277
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,660
 "the secret of being filled and going hungry,

278
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,320
 "both of being in abundance and suffering need.

279
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,360
 "In fact, I know my God is so sufficient

280
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,480
 "to take care of all of my needs."

281
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,420
 That's verse 19.

282
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,300
 According to his riches and glory in Christ Jesus,

283
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,300
 "that I can go through anything as He strengthens me."

284
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,040
 That doesn't mean if you're five foot six,

285
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,840
 if you trust Jesus, you're gonna be able to dunk

286
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,040
 from the free throw line.

287
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,880
 So quit quoting that verse every time you're trying

288
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,720
 to get that last set up.

289
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,880
 "I can do all things through Christ."

290
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,160
 You're gonna get guillotine and it's gonna come on your neck

291
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,660
 and snap it off if you think that's what that means.

292
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,560
 (congregation laughing)

293
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,400
 All right?

294
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,080
 A verse is telling you if you know Him and walk with Him,

295
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,280
 that you'll be a person that the world will marvel

296
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,880
 at your strength and go, "Who are you?"

297
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,400
 That life isn't unfolding the way you want it

298
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,880
 to unfold, my God, you're 27 and still a virgin?

299
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,440
 How are you not neurotic?

300
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,960
 And you should say, "Well, look, man, I'm not against sex.

301
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
 "God, in fact, invented it, He's for it.

302
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,180
 "But I can go through even a series,

303
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,520
 "a season of chastity and faithfulness

304
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,280
 "and controlling my flesh for the glory of God.

305
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,360
 "And by the way, I'm not dying.

306
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,040
 "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."

307
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,280
 People look at you and go, "Man, who are you?"

308
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,600
 You know, how about this?

309
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,520
 This idea that comes up where if you give,

310
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,640
 it'll be given to you.

311
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
 Now, this is really amazing.

312
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,920
 I wanna spend a little bit of time on this one

313
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,040
 'cause it's gonna get us to where we wanna go

314
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,880
 in just a second.

315
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,300
 When the Bible says, "Give, it will be given to you.

316
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,940
 "They will pour into your lap a good measure.

317
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,580
 "Press down, shake, and together, running over.

318
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,700
 "For by your standard of measure,

319
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,000
 "I will measure back to you in return."

320
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,920
 That's a verse that certain guys love to motivate you

321
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,900
 to give, "Hey, give to the porch, man, give to Watermark,

322
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,320
 "give to this ministry."

323
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,600
 And so in the manner in which you give,

324
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,440
 it'll be given to you.

325
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,280
 So if you want this thing to blow up, man, let's go.

326
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,200
 You know what's amazing?

327
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,100
 You know what verse comes before that?

328
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,680
 It's a verse that helps you understand

329
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,000
 what Jesus is saying in Matthew 7.

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,240
 It's this amazing verse where he says this.

331
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
 He says in verse 37, "Do not judge, bro.

332
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,020
 "And you won't be judged.

333
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,560
 "Don't condemn, and you won't be condemned.

334
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,880
 "Pardon, you will be pardoned.

335
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,900
 "For in the manner in which you give,

336
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,280
 "it will be given to you."

337
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,320
 Do you see the context there?

338
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
 If you go around telling people

339
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,080
 about who they are before me

340
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,640
 and what righteousness looks like,

341
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,040
 then I'm gonna judge you based on how you act before me.

342
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,940
 And it's gonna be pressed down, man,

343
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,860
 and it's gonna blow up on you,

344
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,760
 and it's gonna spill out.

345
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,440
 You don't want that kind of judgment, man.

346
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,640
 But if you're merciful and you give mercy to people,

347
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,600
 guess what, you'll be a person

348
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,840
 that probably received mercy from people

349
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,680
 you received mercy from.

350
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,400
 He blessed the merciful.

351
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,240
 In fact, he said a couple chapters earlier,

352
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,800
 "For they will receive mercy."

353
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,280
 That ain't a verse on giving.

354
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,480
 It's a verse on living.

355
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,720
 Hey, let me just tell you something.

356
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,840
 Never read a Bible verse.

357
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,280
 You read the Bible.

358
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,720
 Father, I pray for my friends tonight.

359
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
 As we teach the Bible,

360
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,840
 that you would protect them from human error.

361
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,080
 I pray that you would allow them to have perceptive hearts,

362
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,400
 that they would be spiritually appraised,

363
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,520
 that they would test every single word I say

364
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,640
 by what your word says.

365
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,160
 The Scripture says, "If we know you,"

366
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,400
 we don't need anybody to be our teacher,

367
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,880
 "but you will illumine it and teach us correctly."

368
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,000
 I pray that I'd be faithful.

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,920
 If the words of my mouth,

370
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,840
 the meditations of my heart right now

371
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
 would be acceptable in your sight,

372
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,120
 my Lord, my rock, and my redeemer.

373
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,840
 But help us, Father,

374
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,440
 to see the truth of what you meant

375
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,320
 and respond fully to it.

376
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,720
 Amen.

377
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,620
 How about this, man?

378
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,720
 Here we go, Matthew chapter seven.

379
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,560
 Let's read this.

380
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,840
 The reason I say this is the most misunderstood

381
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,280
 in all of the world

382
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,320
 is 'cause if people don't know Philippians 4, 13

383
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,180
 or Jeremiah 29, 11, let me just tell you something.

384
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,680
 They know Matthew seven.

385
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,000
 And they're gonna drop it on you, man.

386
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,360
 It's gonna show up on Saturday Night Live.

387
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,840
 It's gonna show up when anybody at all

388
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,680
 enters into a conversation.

389
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,280
 You're gonna hear things like this, man.

390
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,880
 Hey, you ain't the judge of me.

391
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,280
 Lay off, man.

392
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,560
 Hey, who are you to judge me?

393
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,480
 In fact, what I wanna do is just take a moment.

394
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,060
 And what we did is we went back,

395
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,800
 when I began on purpose, I do this at times,

396
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,680
 I jump on social media and I try,

397
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,040
 well, I don't try, I just make statements

398
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,900
 that I know people are gonna probably respond to.

399
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,740
 I hope they do.

400
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,120
 I hope they respond to the truth that's there.

401
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,080
 But often they respond to it in a way

402
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,160
 that they start saying things to me

403
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,920
 and trying to escalate the conversation

404
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,640
 and move it away from an honest, civil conversation

405
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,760
 to name calling.

406
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,400
 And I just try and model on there

407
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,440
 a little bit of how you deal with people.

408
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,400
 And I hope I teach you a little bit of that tonight.

409
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,480
 Right now, on my blog, wordsfromwags.com

410
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,320
 is where you can find that.

411
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,920
 I wanna just show you, I wanna walk you through.

412
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,920
 I did this not long ago when Bruce Jenner,

413
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,780
 now goes by the name Caitlin.

414
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,220
 And I agree with a good friend of mine,

415
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,500
 John Piper, and people go,

416
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,700
 "If Bruce was around you, what would you call him?"

417
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,260
 And I go, "Well, look, names are just kind of random.

418
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,500
 "You assign a name to people, it's kind of a cultural thing."

419
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,380
 And so I guess I wouldn't wanna keep throwing his face

420
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
 that his name is Bruce, because if he wants to,

421
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,380
 he can change his name to, I don't know, whatever he wants.

422
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,900
 If he wants to legally change his name to Caitlin,

423
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,740
 that's fine.

424
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,660
 Listen, I married Alex.

425
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,300
 Okay, that's what we call her, that's her name.

426
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,940
 Alexandria is what her parents called her.

427
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,540
 But if you heard, "Man, Todd's hanging out with Alex a lot."

428
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,340
 You know, you might wanna go and check that out

429
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,860
 and see what that really means.

430
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,980
 But names are just arbitrary, okay?

431
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,940
 They're just assigned by culture.

432
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,140
 Now, pronouns are not arbitrary.

433
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,680
 Pronouns are assigned by God.

434
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,620
 And so I might call Bruce Caitlin,

435
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,420
 but I won't call him her,

436
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,540
 'cause it's not loving.

437
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,300
 But let me ask you guys a question.

438
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,780
 What do you think the world's gonna say

439
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,020
 when I say it's not loving to call him her?

440
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,260
 Let me show you.

441
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,340
 It's a little bit of my interchange

442
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,260
 with different people out there on social media.

443
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,740
 And I went out, and just on the night

444
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,740
 that he was on the Espes, I put this out there.

445
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,660
 "It's a tragedy and a disservice to celebrate

446
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,520
 "in his mental illness and foolish

447
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,020
 "to think highly of yourself for celebrating him,"

448
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,580
 which is what the world was certainly doing that night.

449
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,700
 I was just saying, "Listen, Bruce is mentally ill."

450
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,900
 Now, listen, I separate brain illness from mental illness,

451
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,220
 and I do that very specifically

452
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,540
 because the Bible says the problem with all of us

453
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,940
 is that we are wrong-thinking.

454
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,820
 And so the way that we change our lives

455
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,440
 is we begin to think correctly.

456
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,100
 That's why Jesus, just a few verses before where we are

457
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,840
 in Matthew chapter seven and chapter six, said,

458
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,340
 "Hey, bro, here's your problem.

459
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,260
 "The way you think, the way you perceive reality,

460
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,740
 "the way you take in information, your eyes are darkened."

461
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,100
 In other words, you think wrongly,

462
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,660
 you process and don't see clearly.

463
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,140
 And because you don't see and understand

464
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,240
 and perceive reality clearly,

465
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,860
 your perception is the problem.

466
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,680
 That's why you're living the way that you are.

467
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,540
 David Marvin did a great job with that last week,

468
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,700
 talking about seeking the wrong things

469
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,060
 and trying to find life in the wrong things.

470
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:03,620
 And so mental illness is a spiritual problem.

471
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,540
 Brain illness is something different.

472
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,740
 It's a physical problem.

473
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,860
 And I'm just gonna warn you,

474
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,140
 if you are wrong-thinking for a long time,

475
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,860
 it can lead to physical issues in your life.

476
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,740
 This last weekend, man, if you weren't here at Watermark,

477
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,580
 I'm gonna tell you, I think it was one of the best Sundays

478
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,800
 we've ever had at Watermark.

479
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,700
 And the message was amazing.

480
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,180
 And I can say that 'cause I wasn't here.

481
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,060
 In fact, if a pastor should be insecure

482
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,580
 when the most powerful sermons and messages

483
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,340
 and events happen at a church when he's not there,

484
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,940
 I should be the most insecure person

485
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,980
 on the face of the earth.

486
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,100
 'Cause this Sunday, I didn't speak,

487
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,820
 but my buddy JP did, my buddy John Elmore,

488
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,220
 my buddy Rick Smith, they all talked.

489
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,260
 And they did an amazing job.

490
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,120
 JP talked specifically about pornography.

491
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,140
 And one of the things he said there is,

492
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,900
 listen, man, if you perceive that you're gonna find life

493
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,620
 in pornography, it's eventually.

494
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,820
 That mental problem that you think life is found in porn

495
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,500
 is gonna lead to real physical maladies.

496
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,220
 That's not just the Bible's opinion.

497
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,840
 That is scientific fact today.

498
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,080
 And so I'm gonna tell you,

499
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,880
 mental illness can lead to brain illness.

500
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,920
 It can lead to physical maladies.

501
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,440
 But Bruce has gotten, you know,

502
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,200
 Bruce is gonna bring some physical issues on his own life

503
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,680
 because of his mental issues.

504
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,520
 Now some of you guys are going,

505
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,640
 "Is this right for Todd to say that?

506
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,800
 "Isn't this judgmental?"

507
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,200
 We're gonna learn tonight.

508
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,920
 Now watch this, watch what happens.

509
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,720
 Okay, so I said that.

510
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,600
 I followed it up with another statement,

511
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,400
 which is when political correctness hurts people,

512
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
 it's not correct.

513
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,960
 It's not loving.

514
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,840
 It's not being magnanimous.

515
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,760
 In fact, it's really professing to be wise.

516
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,580
 You're becoming a fool.

517
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,720
 Okay, and so here's my first friend

518
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,640
 that pops up to deal with me.

519
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,960
 It's a person named Ryan Lee.

520
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,980
 Later you're gonna see, I saw the female picture there

521
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,440
 and I responded, "Ma'am," and I corrected that later.

522
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,400
 I wasn't trying to be smart.

523
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,040
 I just saw the girl.

524
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,000
 And Ryan is a name that can go both ways.

525
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,040
 And so I thought it was a girl.

526
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,440
 I corrected it, but watch this.

527
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,880
 Ryan said, "Hey, man, I don't understand her illness

528
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,840
 "and what she's going through, so I don't judge, man.

529
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,000
 "I just love."

530
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
 Now watch, who's gonna say this to me?

531
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,840
 "Hey, Todd, leave the judging to God.

532
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,400
 "Oh, this is a God believer.

533
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
 "This is a theist that's now gonna tell me."

534
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,960
 And so I said, "Hey, Ryan, this might help you.

535
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,440
 "What does the Bible mean when it says,

536
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,800
 "judge not, lest you be judged?"

537
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
 Now here's the great news.

538
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,840
 There's six minutes on this

539
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,280
 that you can go to realtruthrealquick.com and check it out.

540
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,760
 Where I just said, "Hey, check this out."

541
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,400
 So he goes and he checks it out.

542
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,740
 And then he responds by saying,

543
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,040
 "Oh, hey, thank you for the spiritual lesson.

544
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,540
 "Here's yours."

545
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,840
 (congregation laughing)

546
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,560
 Now what I like about this

547
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,560
 is that the brother sent me a passage, not a verse.

548
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,400
 Watch this.

549
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,900
 "Hey, love your enemies, do good,

550
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,440
 "and lend, hoping for nothing again,

551
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,920
 "and your reward will be great.

552
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,420
 "He should be highest of the children of the highest,

553
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,120
 "for he is kind unto the thankful and to the evil.

554
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,720
 "Be therefore merciful, as your Father is merciful."

555
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,040
 I'm down with that.

556
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,160
 Judge not, and you won't be judged, man.

557
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,740
 Condemn not, you won't be condemned.

558
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,520
 Forgiven, you shall be forgiven.

559
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,880
 And we know this verse, right?

560
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
 Have you ever read that verse before?

561
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,400
 Say yes, unless you just walked in here.

562
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,760
 I don't think you did.

563
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,600
 You read that.

564
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,420
 Now listen, I love this,

565
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,480
 'cause what he's saying is, he wants me to read what?

566
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,600
 He wants me to read, "Judge not, lest you be judged."

567
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,220
 What do we need to read?

568
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,920
 Well, he's telling me to be kind and merciful.

569
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,120
 And so, so here's my response, man.

570
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,760
 I go, "Hey, man, bro."

571
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,920
 (congregation laughing)

572
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,480
 But let me just remind you,

573
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,880
 that part of kindness is open rebuke.

574
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,440
 And I'm not supposed to conceal love,

575
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,720
 I'm supposed to come forward with it.

576
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,760
 In fact, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend,

577
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,920
 "but deceitful are the kisses of an enemy."

578
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,920
 Oh, so you're saying my script is false.

579
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,320
 No, I didn't say that.

580
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,120
 (congregation laughing)

581
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,440
 I'm just telling you, if you tattoo Philippians 4.13,

582
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,960
 you try and do 100 reps of 245, bro,

583
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,520
 you're going to hurt yourself.

584
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,560
 That's what I'm trying to tell you.

585
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,560
 Even worse, if you are God's agent of truth

586
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,200
 and hope and light, and you misunderstand what he says,

587
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,020
 the world is gonna get dark and deceived.

588
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,680
 He said, "I can go back and forth with you all day long,

589
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,880
 "man, I can see you're not open to other point of view."

590
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,840
 And that's why I said, "No, ma'am, I let her correct this

591
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,080
 "when he let me know he wasn't a man,

592
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,640
 "he's the guy in the picture."

593
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,180
 I said, "Luke 6 is completely true,

594
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,580
 "but thinking love means supporting someone's error

595
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,200
 "is not loving or true."

596
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,560
 Now watch this, follow with me.

597
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,760
 "Oh my God," says Aida.

598
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,040
 "Because of stupid people like this fool,

599
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,680
 "everyone thinks we are Christians

600
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,360
 "and some crazy ass fanatics."

601
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,080
 All right, so I said, "Hey, Aida,

602
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,920
 "can you share with me as a fellow follower of Christ

603
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,120
 "by using God's word where anything I said was crazy ass?

604
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,660
 "'Cause I'd love to know."

605
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,920
 (audience laughing)

606
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,960
 All right, and so she responds.

607
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,800
 Actually, another person I've interacted with before

608
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,520
 on Twitter, Jones Pants is what they call themselves.

609
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,000
 Says, "Her name is Caitlin,

610
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,600
 "and it's really dangerous for trans people

611
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,480
 "when people like you say that supporting us

612
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,680
 "is what hurts us."

613
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,220
 I go, "Hey, Joan, hello again.

614
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,920
 "I wanna love people, not support them."

615
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,880
 Did you catch that?

616
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,040
 I wanna love people.

617
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,120
 Hey, you guys ever heard this?

618
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,680
 Friends don't let friends...

619
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,840
 Ah!

620
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,040
 (audience laughing)

621
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,360
 It's a dangerous town if only a few of you guys know that.

622
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,200
 Right?

623
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,040
 (audience laughing)

624
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,120
 I don't know, friends just party all night

625
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,120
 and get on 75 and 90, man, I don't know.

626
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,560
 Let me ask you again for my sake.

627
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,880
 I got kids that are driving.

628
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,440
 Friends don't let friends chop their penis off

629
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,640
 because they think they're a girl.

630
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,480
 They don't.

631
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,640
 All right?

632
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:14,720
 Now listen, they do what they can,

633
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,120
 and they go, "I wanna support you."

634
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,720
 But that's not supporting you, man.

635
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,360
 That's not like, "Bro, all right, I'm down with that.

636
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,200
 "Let's go."

637
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,800
 (audience laughing)

638
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,680
 Now look, you wanna be...

639
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,160
 You gotta understand that a lot of tenor

640
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,400
 just has gotta come because there's something

641
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,880
 really wrong with the mind that thinks

642
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,840
 that's what it's gotta do to find life.

643
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,000
 But are you tracking with me?

644
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,920
 Now watch, you know, I just go,

645
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,880
 "Look, man, when political correctness hurts people,

646
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,080
 "it is not correct, it is not loving,

647
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,920
 "it's not magnanimous."

648
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,760
 I repeat that.

649
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,800
 And so, hey, transphobia is the mental illness,

650
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,560
 which is really what exactly has happened in our society.

651
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,440
 People that used to study the human mind

652
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,520
 said that homosexuality and transgender dysphoria

653
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,600
 was the mental illness, and guess what?

654
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,960
 It's completely switched now.

655
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,920
 And now it's people who think that telling boys

656
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,480
 they're boys and girls they're girls

657
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,240
 without letting them think it through

658
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,760
 are the people who are mentally ill.

659
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,320
 That's what's happening in our world today,

660
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,960
 and the reason it's happening is because you all

661
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,480
 misunderstand Matthew 7, and you don't wanna be a hater.

662
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,560
 And we're gonna clear that up tonight,

663
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,600
 and we're gonna send out of this room

664
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,960
 3,000 people to get it right,

665
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,760
 and another 1,000 in Fort Worth,

666
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,240
 and I hope you share this message with other people, man.

667
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,960
 And I just say to 'em, I understand it's your position.

668
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,400
 As we discuss the wisdom of our different takes,

669
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,640
 let's do it well and without calling it hate.

670
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,280
 Another person shows up, Tokyo David,

671
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,440
 and just says, "Hey, man, to me,

672
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,680
 "transphobia and ignorance is a mental illness

673
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,520
 "and a tragedy.

674
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,600
 "You get help."

675
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,440
 And I say, "Hey, Tokyo David,

676
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,200
 "let's try and help each other, bro.

677
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,080
 "If something is true,

678
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,440
 "no amount of scrutiny will affect it,

679
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,880
 "so let's talk about our different ideas

680
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,440
 "and what's the merit of them."

681
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,360
 Ina comes back in and say, "Calling someone mentally ill

682
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,800
 "just because they're different is wrong."

683
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,960
 Agreed, I say.

684
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,040
 But we are talking about more than being different.

685
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,480
 We're talking about contradicting what is real

686
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,520
 and what is true.

687
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,480
 You know what's amazing?

688
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,200
 Some of you guys are tracking, and you're kinda,

689
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,280
 wow, can you really say that?

690
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,720
 That someone's a boy because of their DNA

691
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,320
 and because of their God-assigned gender?

692
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,160
 Can you say that?

693
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,680
 It's amazing where we've gotten.

694
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,000
 Because people are no longer making judgments

695
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,080
 that God says, "Hey, if you judge this wrongly,

696
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,240
 "if you get on the broad road,

697
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,280
 "it's gonna lead to destruction.

698
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,320
 "Truth is narrow.

699
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,920
 "I'm gonna teach you that tonight."

700
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,400
 It's always been narrow,

701
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,280
 and God wants people who love people to speak up.

702
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,000
 So watch this, man.

703
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,600
 Somebody says something to me.

704
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,120
 Actually, it was Jellybean897.

705
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,760
 They later removed, Jellybean got rid of their post.

706
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,720
 But what they basically said is I was bullying,

707
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,160
 and I said, "Hey, bro, I'm not gonna support

708
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,080
 "anti-gay bullying, but I'm gonna tell you,

709
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,680
 "not loving children with grace and truth,

710
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,800
 "that's today's problem.

711
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,120
 "That's child abuse."

712
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,680
 When you let a six-year-old say,

713
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,920
 "Hey, I think I'm presenting as a girl

714
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,760
 "even though I'm a boy.

715
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,560
 "I think I'm a boy even though I'm a girl."

716
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,800
 That's child abuse to support that.

717
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,600
 Do you all understand that?

718
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,160
 That's parental sickness when a six-year-old can tell you

719
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,400
 that there's something other than

720
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,080
 thousands of years of human history have confirmed,

721
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,700
 and that, by the way, science has confirmed over time

722
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,840
 changing their gender because they think

723
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,080
 they might be a different gender

724
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,640
 is not going to take care of their mental illness.

725
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,520
 And probably at six, they're not mentally ill.

726
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,160
 They're just learning.

727
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,960
 Man, I can remember when I was five-year-olds,

728
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,840
 Karen Hollenbeck was my best friend.

729
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,960
 I used to play dolls over at Karen Hollenbeck's house

730
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
 all the time.

731
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,720
 I loved it.

732
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,120
 She was cute, she was fun, she was also fast.

733
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,920
 And I can remember sometimes being up in a room

734
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,600
 playing with dolls.

735
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,960
 I don't know if I grabbed Ken or Barbie.

736
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
 All I knew was hanging out with my buddy.

737
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,200
 Can you imagine if I went home and go,

738
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,160
 "Hey, I think I like Barbie."

739
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,940
 And somebody, because I was five and had a friend,

740
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,740
 would have said, "Well, chase that."

741
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,680
 Hey, what Joan's Pants comes back and says

742
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,960
 is to me basically this,

743
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,880
 and you can see the other interactions I have with Blair.

744
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,960
 Tolerance doesn't mean every opinion is equally true.

745
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,320
 That's a wrong opinion of tolerance.

746
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,340
 I'm gonna give this to you in a minute.

747
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,400
 Saying that it hurts trans people to be supported,

748
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,960
 Joan lets me know, that's what's hateful.

749
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,080
 And I just respond, I support their right to choose.

750
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,880
 I will defend their right to choose.

751
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,420
 And against any hate that comes against them

752
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,900
 for choosing that, but I can't support their choice is wise.

753
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,000
 All right, man, hey, I'm gonna tell you all day long,

754
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,980
 you're free to choose.

755
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,400
 That's not my idea, that's God's.

756
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,100
 I'm not gonna sit there and tell you

757
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,560
 that your choice is gonna lead to life.

758
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,700
 And if you wanna call me a hater because I say that,

759
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,380
 I'm gonna be the one that after you call me a hater

760
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,800
 for a lot of years, you're probably gonna come back

761
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,580
 and say, "Hey, man, you were the one person that loved me.

762
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,740
 "Everybody else just wanted to get on the bandwagon

763
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,040
 "and follow me down this road to destruction.

764
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,260
 "But you loved me and I hated you for it."

765
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,580
 I think every single one of you guys

766
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,700
 is gonna say that one day to God.

767
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,180
 I think your knees gonna bow before him.

768
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,740
 Whether you ever do it on this earth or not,

769
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,540
 you're gonna bow before him and say, "God, you loved me.

770
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,460
 "You gave me your word, you protected it,

771
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,020
 "you sovereignly made it the most popular

772
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,300
 "and read and distributed book in the history of the world.

773
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,580
 "You had one man that came

774
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,880
 "that all of human history pivoted on.

775
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,520
 "That man died on the cross for my sins.

776
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,180
 "I've heard the story.

777
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,220
 "Even if I didn't hear the story,

778
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,380
 "I saw your beauty in order and design and creation.

779
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,980
 "And you gave me a conscience.

780
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,620
 "And so I knew that what I did was wrong

781
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,220
 "and I never honored my conscience

782
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,580
 "or honored you in creation.

783
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,860
 "And I suppressed the truth and unrighteousness,

784
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,940
 "but thank you for the conscience that you gave me

785
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,700
 "that I spit on and destroyed my life.

786
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,940
 "Thank you.

787
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,900
 "You are God and you are king and I despised you.

788
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,140
 "But I acknowledge you now as Lord."

789
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,340
 That is gonna happen one day.

790
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,540
 And what God says is if you know he's that now,

791
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,380
 he expects you to love other people.

792
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,820
 You guys can go and look at that blog post.

793
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,380
 I'm not gonna spend any more time reading the rest of that

794
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,180
 'cause there's better words that I'm gonna show you.

795
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,380
 I'm gonna teach them to you correctly.

796
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,100
 So what's going on here in Matthew 7?

797
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
 Let's read the verses I'm assigned to teach you tonight.

798
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,940
 Here they come.

799
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,900
 "Do not judge that you won't be judged.

800
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,720
 "For the way that you judge, you will be judged.

801
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,680
 "And by your standard of measure will be measured to you.

802
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,500
 "Why do you look at the speck that's in your brother's eye

803
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,340
 "but do not notice the log that's in your own eye?

804
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,300
 "How can you say to your brother,

805
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,640
 "let me take the speck out of your eye?

806
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,560
 "Behold, the log is in your own eye.

807
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,740
 "You hypocrite, first take the log out of your eye

808
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,420
 "and then you will see clearly to take the speck

809
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,140
 "out of your brother's eye.

810
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,460
 "Don't give what's holy to dogs.

811
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,820
 "Don't throw your pearls before swine

812
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,860
 "or they will trample them under their feet

813
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,540
 "and turn and tear you to pieces."

814
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,940
 Now listen, here's what you need to know.

815
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,060
 When you read the Bible, it's context, context, context.

816
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,260
 Let the Bible interpret itself.

817
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,700
 What you need to know is that God

818
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,820
 is not the author of confusion.

819
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,100
 And so you wanna listen to what he says.

820
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,260
 Don't ever change your life

821
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,380
 or don't ever read a Bible verse.

822
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,060
 Now look, there's some Bible verses if you read it.

823
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,700
 All right, you're gonna find out

824
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,500
 that what that verse means in its most literal sense

825
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,100
 presented by itself is supported by the larger statement.

826
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,420
 And so you might get away with it

827
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,540
 if the only Bible verse you ever read is John 14, six,

828
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,220
 that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life

829
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,260
 and no one comes to the Father except by him.

830
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,260
 You might get away with Acts 4, 12,

831
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,740
 which says there's no other name under heaven

832
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,160
 by which men must be saved except the name Lord Jesus.

833
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,900
 You might get away with John 3, 16.

834
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,100
 For God so loved the world

835
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,180
 that he gave his only begotten son

836
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,580
 that whosoever believes in him should not perish

837
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,020
 but have eternal life.

838
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,460
 There's a few verses that you're gonna find out

839
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,980
 that is said again and again and again and again

840
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,820
 and again in the story,

841
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,020
 but it's still a good thing to tell you,

842
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,500
 context, context, context.

843
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,100
 Don't ever read a Bible verse, read a Bible passage.

844
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,300
 Because most of the time it's gonna really jack you up.

845
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,660
 And this is one.

846
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,300
 What was the very first thing that I got hit with

847
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,140
 when I stepped out there

848
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,900
 and tried to say some things to our world?

849
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,640
 Hey, by the way, I think Bruce Jenner or Caitlyn

850
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,620
 is very courageous.

851
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,120
 One of the things that he did,

852
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,360
 I do think he's courageous,

853
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
 but not for the reason he got an SB.

854
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,640
 He's courageous because he said,

855
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,340
 this is where I'm struggling.

856
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,440
 His problem was that his church

857
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,740
 convinced him it wasn't a struggle.

858
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:33,000
 His church said, bro, man, let's go.

859
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,560
 It was Hozier's church.

860
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,480
 Take me to church, let's go.

861
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,640
 I will worship like a dog.

862
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,800
 Hey, that's what happened

863
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,600
 is that Bruce Jenner was courageous.

864
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,880
 He said, hey, I'm starting to think,

865
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,200
 I know I won the gold medal in '76 in Montreal

866
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,040
 as the men's decathlete.

867
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,360
 I was the greatest athlete on the world,

868
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,320
 but because of a lot of other issues,

869
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,060
 I'm having some real gender dysphoria.

870
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,320
 Now listen, in '76, Bruce Jenner was surrounded by a culture

871
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,880
 that said, Bruce, that's not healthy.

872
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,800
 Now, unfortunately, he didn't run into the loving people

873
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,640
 that really began to help him work through some of that.

874
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,840
 What he did is he started running with the Kardashians

875
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,040
 and others who were like, hey,

876
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,000
 whatever's gonna work out there, let's make it work.

877
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,360
 But I wanna tell you something, man.

878
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,320
 If you're here struggling, we're not gonna laugh at you

879
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,240
 because you've got gender dysphoria.

880
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,480
 I hope you don't laugh at me that I am polyamorous.

881
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,320
 And that in my heart, I'm never satisfied

882
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,220
 with just one beautiful woman who's given me six children.

883
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,300
 I hope you don't mock me that when I heard

884
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,480
 about Exotica coming to Dallas, I had two thoughts.

885
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,280
 One, God bless those 15,000 estimated people

886
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,640
 that wanna go down there and find life,

887
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,480
 and maybe I can go and minister to them

888
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,360
 and get to voyeuristically see some stuff

889
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,440
 that I haven't seen in a long time

890
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,540
 that I still really crave.

891
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,360
 And I hope you don't make fun of me for that.

892
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,800
 'Cause I'm broken, man, my sexuality is all jacked up.

893
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,880
 But I don't need you to tell me, it's all right, Todd.

894
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,120
 You go get you some Jenna Jameson, man, it's all right, Todd.

895
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,880
 You go get you some of that, man.

896
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,360
 That one especially, I mean, maybe you don't wanna go

897
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,480
 and be with her really, but you can fantasize that you are.

898
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,980
 Pornography's a sin, doesn't hurt anybody, really.

899
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,400
 You need to read up.

900
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,120
 (audience laughing)

901
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,440
 And so, man, I hope you don't judge me,

902
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,040
 'cause I'm screwed up, in the sense that you're gonna say,

903
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,240
 I don't want anything to do with a guy like you,

904
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,200
 and God could never love a guy like you,

905
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,320
 'cause I'm jacked up.

906
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,880
 This morning I shared that with the staff.

907
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,840
 I just told them, I said, hey, we were singing the song,

908
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,640
 Lord, I Need You, and there's a line in there

909
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,040
 that just hit me today like never before,

910
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,440
 and that line is, holiness is Christ in me.

911
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,320
 And you know what's so funny?

912
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,400
 I mean, I know that's true, but what's so funny

913
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,680
 is that I sometimes think holiness is Todd Wagner

914
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,120
 getting it after, man, being a pastor now for 30 years,

915
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,600
 preaching the word, knowing it, memorizing a lot of passages,

916
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,560
 not just verses.

917
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,720
 Holiness is the way I live.

918
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,000
 I've loved my wife, been faithful for now a quarter century.

919
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,560
 I've raised my kids to love God.

920
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,280
 Holiness is me getting it done for Jesus.

921
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,820
 That is crazy, unbiblical, and error.

922
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,440
 There is nothing good in me.

923
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,980
 My Bible says, you know what, Todd?

924
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:31,800
 Your flesh is never going to be anything other than cursed,

925
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,600
 and so I'm not trying to have you curb your flesh.

926
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,040
 You need to continually crucify your flesh,

927
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,520
 and the life which you now live in the flesh,

928
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,080
 you live by faith in the Son of God who loved you

929
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,600
 and gave himself up for you.

930
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,620
 You must decrease, and he must increase.

931
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,360
 Do you know where I get screwed up?

932
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,560
 The same way Bruce Jenner gets screwed up

933
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,880
 is when I start to follow what my flesh thinks and feels.

934
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,540
 Feelings are real, they're just not reliable.

935
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,760
 Truth is reliable.

936
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,300
 Follow truth.

937
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,680
 Jesus is truth.

938
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,560
 Follow him.

939
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,320
 Hey man, you might be hearing, you're really whacked out.

940
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,480
 I don't know what your whacked out is.

941
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,160
 I can tell you what mine is,

942
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,040
 and I hope it doesn't make you

943
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,760
 not want to worship God with me.

944
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,800
 But I don't care if you're a guy and you want to be a girl.

945
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,160
 If you're a girl and want to be with a girl,

946
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,960
 or a guy, want to be with a guy.

947
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,800
 I don't care if you're a girl

948
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,280
 and want to find your meaning through guys.

949
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,600
 I don't care if you're a girl

950
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,880
 and you cut babies out of you when they're there

951
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,840
 'cause they're inconvenient.

952
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,360
 You're embarrassed by what you've done.

953
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,320
 I mean, I do care 'cause I love you.

954
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:39,320
 And I've chased some of those nasty roads

955
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,760
 of rebellion myself, and every time I know where they lead,

956
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,360
 and I'm just here to tell you there's a better way.

957
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,840
 And I'm not judging you like God can never judge you.

958
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,120
 That's what the wrong guys did that Jesus is rebuking here.

959
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,920
 See, here's what's going on in Matthew.

960
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,160
 Jesus is saying you want to be blessed,

961
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,560
 here's how you're blessed, you're poor in spirit.

962
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,640
 The Pharisees made a fundamental flaw

963
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,200
 and had a fundamental problem.

964
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,720
 They judged themselves wrongly,

965
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,760
 they judged others wrongly, and they judged God wrongly.

966
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,780
 And what Jesus is saying here in the context is this.

967
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,200
 Go back chapter and a half to Matthew 5, verse 20.

968
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,040
 Hey, unless your righteousness is greater than the Pharisees,

969
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,600
 the guys that their full-time job is to be righteous

970
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,500
 and do righteous things, you're not gonna get into heaven.

971
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,580
 And you're like, what the, are you kidding me?

972
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,220
 Unless I'm more righteous than Mother Teresa

973
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,780
 and Billy Graham's offspring?

974
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:37,460
 If that wasn't enough, then we go to verse 48 of Matthew 5

975
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,380
 where he's continuing the idea.

976
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,220
 He says, hey, here's the deal.

977
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,060
 Be perfect like your heavenly Father is perfect.

978
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,900
 Some of you guys have read that verse

979
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,860
 and you're trying to be perfect.

980
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,980
 Don't read a Bible verse.

981
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,740
 Jesus isn't telling you to be perfect

982
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,380
 and get yourself in religious order.

983
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,000
 He's saying this, hey, bro, the standard is perfection.

984
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,040
 You wanna know how to get to heaven?

985
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
 Be perfect.

986
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,360
 And it should make you go, I screwed that one up

987
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,620
 at like, you know, two hours.

988
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,920
 And if you wanna wait 'til I was old enough

989
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,560
 to be accountable, I screwed that up in two seconds

990
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,520
 after I was accountable.

991
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,060
 I'm not perfect.

992
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,280
 What do I do?

993
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,800
 And Jesus says, what you should do is follow me.

994
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,900
 Trust in me.

995
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,680
 Your lack of perfection brings about an imperfect world.

996
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,640
 Your lack of perfection destroys relationships.

997
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,260
 Your lack of perfection makes you sad, depressed,

998
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,900
 discouraged, at war with each other.

999
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,100
 And I'm here to make that right, man.

1000
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,220
 Let me bring peace.

1001
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,440
 Let's start with you individually

1002
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,700
 and then we'll get a collective group of you

1003
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,040
 and then we'll just expand this thing

1004
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,660
 and eventually I'll work this whole thing out.

1005
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:49,140
 But a little bit later, he comes to these guys

1006
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,100
 who are running this show and he says,

1007
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,320
 hey man, by the way, you guys,

1008
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,760
 you quit judging other people.

1009
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,540
 You quit telling them what they've gotta do

1010
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,560
 to be okay with me because here's the problem.

1011
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,640
 You judge yourself wrong.

1012
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,960
 You think you're righteous.

1013
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,200
 You're not perfect.

1014
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,120
 You're not righteous.

1015
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,040
 And here's your problem.

1016
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,920
 You think you're so good that other people,

1017
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,600
 you judge wrongly, that there's no way

1018
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,440
 they'll be good enough.

1019
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,320
 And so you heap burdens on them, more burdens,

1020
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,600
 and all they become is twice the sons of hell that you are.

1021
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,680
 And you know why you do that?

1022
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,620
 Because you judge me wrongly.

1023
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,200
 You think that I'm satisfied with the deeds of man

1024
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,880
 and you don't know that to me,

1025
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,060
 your righteous deeds are like filthy rags.

1026
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,540
 So I don't care how long you've been a virgin.

1027
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,020
 I don't care how much money you've given.

1028
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,460
 You're not perfect.

1029
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,420
 I'm perfect.

1030
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,180
 I don't merge with imperfect.

1031
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,020
 I have no fellowship with darkness.

1032
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,140
 You need to be born again.

1033
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,620
 And bro, you can't even born yourself.

1034
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,100
 And so you better appeal to something that isn't like you.

1035
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,660
 Start with me, God, creator of heavens and earth.

1036
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,100
 That's your Bible, people.

1037
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,360
 And so what he's saying is, here's your deal, man.

1038
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,640
 Quit telling people what will get them into heaven.

1039
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,560
 What gets them into heaven is that they are poor in spirit.

1040
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,680
 You don't judge yourself correctly.

1041
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,040
 What Jesus is talking about right here

1042
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,780
 is that don't you assign a human standard

1043
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,160
 to a perfect God's righteousness.

1044
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,520
 You wanna help people get reconciled with me?

1045
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,360
 Then why don't you get the log out of your eye?

1046
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,040
 I'd love for you to help people,

1047
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,680
 but you can't see to get the speck out of their eye.

1048
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,640
 And so Jesus told all kinds of stories throughout the Bible.

1049
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,000
 One of them he told in Luke 18,

1050
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,320
 where there's these two guys and they come

1051
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,320
 and one of them is a tax gatherer, a non-Jew.

1052
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,280
 And he didn't even go near the temple.

1053
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,200
 He just falls in his face and he beats his chest

1054
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,040
 and he rips his clothes.

1055
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,360
 He says, "Oh God, have mercy on me, a sinner."

1056
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,840
 And then next to him is a Pharisee, a Jew,

1057
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,680
 adorned in righteousness, follower of the law,

1058
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,000
 keeper of the Sabbath.

1059
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,160
 And he looks at the despicable guy that's over there

1060
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,920
 and he says, "I'm glad I'm not like that guy."

1061
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,960
 And Jesus is going, "Oh my God,

1062
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,600
 "bro, you better start to judge yourself rightly.

1063
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,400
 "That guy, that's the guy I accept.

1064
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,860
 "I don't want your dead works.

1065
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,440
 "You think human performance is enough for my perfection?"

1066
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,680
 See, every single person in this room

1067
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,280
 that is not running to God and embracing him

1068
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,200
 has one of two problems.

1069
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,400
 They either have too high a view of themself

1070
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,880
 or too low a view of God.

1071
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,280
 And usually when you have too high a view of yourself, man,

1072
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,320
 when you're looking down on other people,

1073
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,160
 you can never look up to see the judgment

1074
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,980
 that's coming at you.

1075
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,480
 And Jesus is setting this record straight right here.

1076
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,200
 And he's just telling them flat out, man, here's the deal.

1077
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,060
 Listen to what Jesus said, "Blessed are the poor.

1078
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,040
 "Blessed are those who mourn because they're poor.

1079
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,620
 "Blessed are the meek and are gentle

1080
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,880
 "because they know that apart from God's grace

1081
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,740
 "they're not gonna get anything.

1082
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,360
 "Blessed are those that hunger and thirst for righteousness

1083
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,240
 "because they know they don't have it on them themselves."

1084
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,480
 If you think you're righteous

1085
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,620
 because you go to Watermark, you're a pastor at Watermark,

1086
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,400
 you give to Watermark, you haven't had sex

1087
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,780
 with anybody but your wife, oh man.

1088
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,320
 If you think you're better than people

1089
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,020
 that are gonna go to Exotica this weekend

1090
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,400
 because you think you're not going, pleases me, Todd,

1091
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,020
 every time you look at a woman with lust in your heart,

1092
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,580
 you've committed adultery, man.

1093
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:20,800
 Now, temptation is not sin, but going back over it is sin.

1094
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,340
 I committed adultery, I am sure, sometime this week.

1095
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,920
 And I should add right here,

1096
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,280
 please take my entire sermon in context

1097
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,240
 and don't listen to two seconds, right?

1098
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,400
 (congregation laughing)

1099
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,880
 I know JP goes, "Mark that, we're gonna use that."

1100
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,280
 I'll be pastor here in no time,

1101
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,680
 that's what he's thinking right now.

1102
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,800
 (congregation laughing)

1103
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,040
 You probably ought to be.

1104
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,660
 You probably ought to be, bro.

1105
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,480
 Let me just tell you guys,

1106
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,580
 there's a difference between being judgmental,

1107
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,800
 which is I'm better than you,

1108
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,000
 there's no way that God could ever love you,

1109
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,160
 and making judgments.

1110
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,360
 Can I just say that to you one more time?

1111
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,460
 There's a difference between being judgmental,

1112
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,900
 which is this is what it takes for you

1113
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,060
 to make yourself right with God,

1114
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:14,360
 you better be as good as me, and that is detestable.

1115
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,520
 Can I just tell you something, man?

1116
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,720
 You know, we do, oh, I think it was also in 2006,

1117
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,120
 I gave a message called

1118
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,480
 Homosexuality and Same-Sex Marriage,

1119
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,840
 an apology, an answer, and an assignment.

1120
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,020
 And I just apologized to the homosexual community,

1121
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,180
 and just, can I tell you something, man?

1122
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,760
 We got divorces rampant in our churches,

1123
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,280
 we have not honored marriage here for a long time.

1124
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,620
 And hopefully not at Watermark,

1125
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,060
 but the church, you know, the church has endorsed

1126
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,640
 this no-fault divorce idea,

1127
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,140
 and we're talking about the sanctity of marriage,

1128
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,560
 we don't protect marriage,

1129
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,840
 we're just telling you you can't have it.

1130
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,580
 And by the way, it's not right,

1131
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,860
 because we're screwing up marriage,

1132
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,620
 that we should let you screw up marriage,

1133
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,060
 but we can't tell you that you're the only ones

1134
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,300
 that screw up marriage, but we screw it up constantly.

1135
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,860
 Right, if I not right now asked you guys

1136
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,960
 to raise your hand, how many of you guys

1137
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,780
 are the product of a broken home,

1138
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,960
 a bunch of your hands would go up,

1139
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,440
 and if I said, how many of you guys,

1140
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,940
 you're broken home, it's because you had two mommies,

1141
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,780
 or two daddies?

1142
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:15,580
 Probably, at this day and age, maybe one or two,

1143
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,620
 because not many were when you were kids.

1144
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:23,120
 But we've been stomping all over marriage for a long time,

1145
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:23,960
 and we've been telling people,

1146
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,780
 God won't love you if you think gay marriage is good.

1147
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,580
 Now by the way, God loves you,

1148
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,700
 he demonstrates his love for you,

1149
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,160
 and that while you still think gay marriage,

1150
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,940
 or homosexuality, or transgender issues,

1151
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,600
 or pornography, or lustful thoughts,

1152
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,100
 or whatever it is that's not perfect,

1153
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,220
 he's loved you for a long time, man.

1154
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,420
 He demonstrates his love for you,

1155
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,900
 and that while you're yet sinners, he died for you.

1156
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:51,820
 But it's not loving for him just to go,

1157
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,380
 all right, well go ahead, 'cause he knows

1158
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,700
 if you sow to the flesh, you're gonna reap destruction.

1159
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,300
 And friends, don't let friends drive to destruction.

1160
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,300
 And so what Jesus is saying right here,

1161
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,660
 man, you guys better watch yourself.

1162
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,700
 Man, you're in a position of power,

1163
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,220
 you're telling people a lot about me.

1164
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,180
 If you start telling people they're gonna be measured

1165
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,260
 by the way that they perform,

1166
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,320
 I'm gonna measure you by the way you perform,

1167
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,500
 and it's not gonna go well with you.

1168
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,360
 And so he's telling them, repent.

1169
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,540
 Let me tell you something,

1170
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,540
 Jesus never said to not make judgments.

1171
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,500
 If you keep reading in Matthew 7,

1172
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,300
 he's gonna say, you're gonna know a kind of tree

1173
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,340
 by guess what?

1174
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,300
 A judgment.

1175
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,500
 How do you know it's a banana tree?

1176
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,620
 It has, go ahead, it's okay.

1177
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:45,420
 It has a banana.

1178
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,040
 How do you know it's a boy?

1179
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,620
 (audience laughing)

1180
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:03,800
 Smart crowd.

1181
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,880
 (audience laughing)

1182
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,200
 And when you stop making those kind of judgments, man,

1183
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,820
 you just kind of go, are you serious?

1184
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,280
 We are some seriously jacked up people.

1185
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,920
 Professing to be wise, we become really, really foolish.

1186
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,800
 And we call ourselves magnanimous,

1187
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,920
 and we tell somebody they're courageous

1188
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,920
 because they go to a peach and say it's a banana.

1189
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,360
 I go, that's just not healthy.

1190
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,840
 (audience laughing)

1191
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,160
 Let me ask you guys a question.

1192
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,800
 If you say that a dog's tail is a leg,

1193
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,560
 how many legs does a dog have?

1194
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,480
 (audience laughing)

1195
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,720
 Abraham Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln asked that question.

1196
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,720
 It's the Abraham Lincoln quote.

1197
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,840
 He says, hey man, if you call a dog's tail a leg,

1198
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,440
 how many legs does a dog have?

1199
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,800
 He says that it's four.

1200
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,360
 You're calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.

1201
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,480
 Do you know what's happening today, people?

1202
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,720
 Can I just tell you something?

1203
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,640
 What's happening is that people are starting

1204
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,640
 to call a tail a leg.

1205
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,200
 And we're going, we've been screwed up for a long time.

1206
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,040
 Fido's got five legs.

1207
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,480
 (audience laughing)

1208
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,560
 We're not screwed up.

1209
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,160
 We're screwed up when we start to call a tail a leg.

1210
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,360
 It's not, and what Jesus is saying is crazy.

1211
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,680
 Can I just show you guys something?

1212
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,120
 Watch this.

1213
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,480
 I'm gonna read to you from Ephesians chapter four.

1214
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,720
 Just listen to this, okay?

1215
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,200
 I mean, this is all through your Bible.

1216
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,680
 Ephesians chapter four, verse 11.

1217
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,360
 Hey, God gave some as apostles, people that are sent forth,

1218
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,880
 some as prophets, those are fourth tellers,

1219
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,600
 or maybe even foretellers.

1220
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,920
 Some as evangelists, some as pastors, some as teachers.

1221
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,400
 Thank God he gave us pastors and teachers.

1222
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,280
 You know what's amazing?

1223
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,680
 Guess who they're putting on news today?

1224
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,120
 They're putting guys on TV with robes.

1225
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,080
 They look like pastors, they look like teachers,

1226
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,680
 and they're going, that's marriage.

1227
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,280
 That's loving to accept them

1228
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,160
 and telling them what they're doing

1229
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,960
 is not gonna screw them up, and it's screwing them up.

1230
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,960
 And it's screwing you up.

1231
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,960
 And if you're a pastor, is this mind,

1232
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,680
 yeah, I mean, does somebody agree,

1233
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,880
 or is it scary to go, I think he's right, but I.

1234
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,880
 (audience laughing)

1235
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,400
 I think he's right, but man,

1236
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,160
 I'm starting to think dogs have five legs.

1237
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,440
 Dogs don't have five legs.

1238
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,560
 I mean, there might be one at the state fair next year

1239
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,400
 that has five legs.

1240
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,040
 Lay down your four tickets and go see it.

1241
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,640
 But they don't generally have five legs.

1242
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,880
 They've got four.

1243
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,520
 And so God sends people forth.

1244
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,360
 Who does he send forth?

1245
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,920
 He sends forth people that know him,

1246
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,120
 and so they know truth, and they love people.

1247
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,400
 And friends don't let friends live dissipated,

1248
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,200
 disillusioned, drunken lives.

1249
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,560
 Do you know what my friend who said,

1250
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,040
 Todd, here's some scripture for you.

1251
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,280
 Do you know what it keeps saying

1252
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,680
 if you keep reading where they had me?

1253
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,840
 It says when the blind lead the blind,

1254
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,360
 they both fall into a pit.

1255
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,960
 Can I tell you what's happening in America?

1256
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,560
 We've got blind leaders.

1257
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,960
 And here's what else is happening in America.

1258
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,480
 The same thing that happened in Nazi Germany.

1259
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,140
 I want you guys to listen to me very carefully.

1260
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,760
 There's a thing called the spiral of silence,

1261
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,920
 and it's happening because you misunderstand

1262
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,240
 because you've been beaten down with Matthew 7.

1263
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,760
 I want you to see how I responded to Matthew 7.

1264
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,440
 We put together a resource for you,

1265
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,960
 and we can go, hey, here's what it means

1266
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,840
 in Matthew chapter 7.

1267
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,600
 Now, you can either send me this message,

1268
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,360
 or you can send it to six or seven minutes there

1269
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,440
 in Real Truth, Real Quick,

1270
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,760
 and you go, this is what it really means.

1271
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,360
 I just unpack it for him really quickly right there

1272
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,080
 so that you stop being pushed into silence.

1273
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,120
 There's a thing that Elizabeth Noelle Newman,

1274
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,800
 who was a Nazi journalist,

1275
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,480
 she wrote for a Nazi paper back in the 1940s in Germany,

1276
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,520
 and she noticed that there was a pattern in humankind,

1277
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,240
 and Hitler tapped into it,

1278
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,060
 and it's when a tiny majority of the population

1279
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,760
 control the conversation,

1280
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,740
 and what happens is because people by nature

1281
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,760
 are reluctant to go against what they perceive

1282
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,840
 to be the tide of public opinion,

1283
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,960
 and they're frightened,

1284
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,880
 the majority that knows that dogs have four legs go,

1285
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,280
 well, no one else is saying that there's just four legs.

1286
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,320
 Everybody's saying it's five.

1287
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,760
 I don't wanna be the guy who gets it wrong.

1288
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,800
 I don't wanna be the guy who goes, no, there's four,

1289
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,320
 and so they stop, and they go, well, maybe I'm wrong.

1290
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,200
 When everybody in the room goes, that's a tale,

1291
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,320
 but because influential, funny people

1292
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,100
 like John Stewart, Barack Obama,

1293
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:31,700
 pastors who are no pastors start to say some things,

1294
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,020
 you're like, what?

1295
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,140
 I don't know what to do.

1296
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,100
 You know what's so funny is in 2006,

1297
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,200
 I was watching Bill Maher.

1298
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,100
 You guys know Bill Maher, right?

1299
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,060
 Politically incorrect.

1300
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:42,660
 It was right after Jeffrey Dahmer died.

1301
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,660
 You guys know, raise your hand

1302
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,540
 if you know who Jeffrey Dahmer is

1303
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,820
 so I don't have to waste any time.

1304
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,460
 Okay, Jeffrey Dahmer was a famous serial killer.

1305
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,240
 I ask that 'cause I know a lot of you guys don't know.

1306
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,040
 He was a famous serial killer in the early 2000s.

1307
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,440
 He started when he was a kid by just killing cats

1308
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,500
 and torturing animals, and it progressed

1309
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,440
 to where he needed to torture children,

1310
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,160
 and then he didn't just torture them.

1311
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,780
 He killed 'em, and he preserved 'em, and he ate 'em.

1312
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:13,200
 Okay, and this is what Bill Maher did.

1313
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,380
 He actually said this.

1314
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,880
 He goes, he did a eulogy for Jeffrey Dahmer.

1315
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,260
 He goes, we're here today to honor Jeffrey.

1316
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:27,220
 You know, Jeffrey was known to rape and eat his friends,

1317
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,840
 but who am I to judge?

1318
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,360
 And then his little bit continued.

1319
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,620
 Bill Maher laughed at himself.

1320
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,780
 Everybody else laughed.

1321
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,620
 Guess what?

1322
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,880
 I don't know, man.

1323
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,060
 I don't know how long this is gonna be funny.

1324
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,760
 Right, I mean, after all, who are you to judge?

1325
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,500
 Now, you guys, Michael, that is so absurd.

1326
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,860
 Okay, well, just roll back about 15 years

1327
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,100
 and check out what we thought was absurd then.

1328
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,580
 It had something to do with bananas.

1329
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:07,380
 And I'm just telling you, it's because people

1330
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,180
 who know the truth as teachers aren't speaking up.

1331
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,660
 And it says here in Ephesians, you know,

1332
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,540
 in verse 12, right after that, it says that the reason

1333
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,100
 that these people are there is to equip the saints.

1334
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,940
 That's what we're doing tonight.

1335
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,140
 That's why I'm so glad you guys are here.

1336
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,140
 About 3,000 of you, about 1,000 of you in Fort Worth, I hope.

1337
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,820
 You're gonna get it right,

1338
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,480
 and you're gonna change the world.

1339
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,060
 Until we all attain the unity of the faith

1340
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,580
 and the knowledge of the Son of God to mature men,

1341
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,780
 men to the measure of the stature which belongs

1342
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,060
 to the fullness of the kindness that is God.

1343
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,860
 His name is Jesus, and as a result,

1344
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:47,860
 we're no longer going to be children tossed here and there

1345
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,020
 by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine,

1346
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,740
 by the trickery of men, by the craftiness

1347
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,660
 and deceitful scheming.

1348
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,240
 You all are being lied to, and it's killing your generation.

1349
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,860
 And I'm telling you that children have no judgment.

1350
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,180
 And if you teach them that that's normal,

1351
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,460
 they'll grow up thinking it's normal.

1352
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,980
 Children don't know it's a light socket.

1353
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,020
 They think it's just a hole to play with.

1354
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,340
 They don't know it's not a Tootsie Roll

1355
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,780
 laying in the front yard.

1356
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,660
 I've had 'em.

1357
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,260
 And they go, "Look, Hershey's just littered stuff

1358
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,540
 "all over our front yard."

1359
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,380
 You know?

1360
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,220
 No!

1361
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:37,340
 Was that being judgmental when I dove over landmines

1362
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,300
 to keep them from eating one?

1363
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,580
 No, it was courageous is what it was.

1364
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,900
 You're not a courageous parent when your kid goes,

1365
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,300
 "I don't know, world."

1366
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,420
 Well, let's call it a Tootsie Roll.

1367
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:59,740
 So here's what I wanna do.

1368
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,340
 I'll just give you some application, okay?

1369
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,500
 There's so much more I could do,

1370
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,180
 but you see what the passage is saying?

1371
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,780
 It's telling you, man, listen.

1372
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,780
 In Matthew 7, it's saying, "Don't be somebody

1373
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,580
 "who thinks that they are right with God

1374
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,820
 "because they do a few things that other people aren't doing.

1375
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,480
 "Christianity is not what you do.

1376
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,060
 "It is trusting in what Christ has done."

1377
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,900
 Christianity is not what you do

1378
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,660
 to make yourself righteous in God's eyes.

1379
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:21,740
 That's dead religion.

1380
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,300
 Christianity is understanding that there's nothing

1381
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,180
 that you can do to ever make yourself perfect again,

1382
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,680
 and it's being poor in spirit.

1383
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,020
 It's mourning.

1384
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,020
 It's being meek.

1385
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,060
 It's hungering after righteousness

1386
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,340
 'cause you see the ruin that comes

1387
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,740
 from your unrighteousness.

1388
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,940
 Christianity is what God has done,

1389
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,060
 embracing it by grace through faith.

1390
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:48,300
 And so here's what we should do as people

1391
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,500
 who have taken a log out of our own eye.

1392
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,340
 We're not betting the people

1393
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,460
 are gonna be at Exotica this weekend.

1394
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,500
 We're just like 'em, frankly,

1395
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,740
 maybe just 'cause we wanna, for whatever reason right now,

1396
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,420
 have some standing in the Christian community.

1397
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:03,420
 Some of us kinda are thinking that we're not gonna go down

1398
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,580
 there 'cause they don't wanna be caught.

1399
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,460
 You know, we're not gonna go down there

1400
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,300
 'cause they don't wanna be caught,

1401
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,140
 but you're gonna look at plenty of it.

1402
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,960
 You don't need to go down there.

1403
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,220
 You got all the Exotica you want right here

1404
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,260
 in your little smartphone, your computer,

1405
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,540
 and you're gonna judge those people that are so brazen

1406
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,440
 they'll pay for it and go walk around.

1407
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,020
 No, man, those are my brothers and sisters down there.

1408
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:22,920
 I'm just like 'em.

1409
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,320
 God's been kind to me, an ungrateful and wicked man.

1410
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:31,300
 So I wanna tell them about the hope that I've got,

1411
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,380
 that God has allowed me to be sovereign over this flesh

1412
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,860
 which seeks destruction.

1413
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:40,260
 So here's what I'd exhort you to do

1414
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,060
 as you try and figure out what to do

1415
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,620
 with this text as a right application.

1416
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,700
 Number one, I would just tell you, man,

1417
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,940
 number one, let...

1418
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:52,340
 Well, I'll start by just saying this, man.

1419
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,180
 It's a better way to say it.

1420
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,260
 Number one, get to know yourself.

1421
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,060
 I mean, really get to know yourself.

1422
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,260
 I mean, be honest about who you are.

1423
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,460
 Quit trying to help people think

1424
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,420
 that you're some really righteous person.

1425
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,820
 Get to know yourself.

1426
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,820
 You know who I am?

1427
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,900
 I'm somebody who's a sinner.

1428
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,220
 I'm saved by grace, by the grace of God,

1429
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,140
 sustained by Christ.

1430
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,380
 I am desperately sick.

1431
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,580
 My heart is deceitful above all else.

1432
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,100
 I've been justified as a saint.

1433
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,460
 I am being sanctified by God's grace,

1434
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,980
 God's word, God's spirit, and God's people,

1435
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,440
 but I'm not yet glorified.

1436
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,340
 I sometimes act pridefully.

1437
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,880
 I sometimes act in anger.

1438
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,260
 I sometimes double-click on a lustful thought

1439
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,620
 and don't flee immorality.

1440
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1441
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,620

01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1554
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1555
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1556
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1557
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1558
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1559
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1560
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1561
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1562
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:36,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1563
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1564
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1565
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,620
 I sometimes act in a way that's not right.

1566
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,620
 My friends, they know.

1567
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,620
 They know exactly where the enemy's gonna attack me.

1568
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,620
 They pray for me.

1569
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,620
 They make sure I'm removing from myself

1570
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,620
 opportunities to bring destruction into my life.

1571
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,620
 They exhort me towards

1572
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:56,620
 things that make for peace and righteousness

1573
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,620
 in life, and that is the only reason

1574
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,620
 you won't see me at Exotica this weekend.

1575
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,620
 That is the only reason.

1576
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,620
 Because of the grace of God

1577
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,620
 manifest through His people, His Word,

1578
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,620
 and His Spirit.

1579
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,620
 So let others know you.

1580
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,620
 And you let others love you.

1581
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,620
 And you tell them, "If you ever see me moving in another direction,

1582
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,620
 man, I want you to judge that what I'm doing is wrong.

1583
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,620
 I want you to speak the truth to me in love.

1584
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,620
 I want you to admonish me,

1585
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,620
 encourage me, and help me."

1586
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,620
 Psalm 141

1587
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:26,620
 says, "Let the righteous

1588
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,620
 smite me in kindness.

1589
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,620
 It is as oil upon the head.

1590
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,620
 Do not let me

1591
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:34,620
 refuse it."

1592
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,620
 You let

1593
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,620
 others love you. And can I just give you one more

1594
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,620
 assignment?

1595
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,620
 Because

1596
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,620
 America pivots on whether

1597
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,620
 or not you do this last thing.

1598
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:48,620
 You gotta love

1599
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,620
 other people.

1600
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,620
 You gotta speak up.

1601
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,620
 If you think you would have spoken up in the middle

1602
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:58,620
 of a Holocaust in the 1940s

1603
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,620
 if you lived in Germany, prove it.

1604
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,620
 'Cause there's a bigger Holocaust going on

1605
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,620
 right now, right around you.

1606
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,620
 If you haven't been paying attention to a few videos that are

1607
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,620
 pushing it in your face right now, tune in.

1608
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,620
 Speak up.

1609
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,620
 And don't mind

1610
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,620
 that you're hated because you speak up.

1611
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,620
 Courageous men were hung and executed

1612
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,620
 because they spoke up

1613
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,620
 in the 1940s. And you stop

1614
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,620
 telling me that you would have stood against

1615
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,620
 racism. Because I'm gonna tell you something.

1616
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:26,620
 Slavery was institutionalized

1617
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,620
 racism.

1618
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,620
 And abortion is institutionalized

1619
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,620
 murder.

1620
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,620
 And I'm not mad

1621
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,620
 at racists.

1622
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,620
 I'm not mad

1623
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,620
 at people who are having abortions. I know

1624
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,620
 what it does. We have a ministry here called Someone Cares.

1625
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,620
 If you've been a part of an abortion story, would you let us love

1626
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,620
 you and let you find the forgiveness that

1627
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,620
 God has for women like

1628
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,620
 you that have made that decision? We've got a ministry called

1629
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,620
 Forgotten Fathers. Would you let us help you?

1630
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,620
 We want you

1631
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:58,620
 to find the grace and forgiveness that we need.

1632
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,620
 Just like you.

1633
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,620
 But you better speak up,

1634
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,620
 people. Love others.

1635
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,620
 Silence in the midst of sin

1636
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,620
 is sin.

1637
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:12,620
 Father, I pray for my friends that we would just unleash

1638
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:16,620
 a thousand lovers of this world

1639
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,620
 who are willing to do what you

1640
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,620
 did. Which is

1641
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,620
 suffer for the sake of righteousness. To be

1642
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,620
 hated because truth sounds

1643
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,620
 like hate to those who hate the truth. And we were

1644
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:28,620
 haters of truth. We were hateful.

1645
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,620
 Hating one another.

1646
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,620
 Filled with envy. Malice.

1647
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:36,620
 And in your kindness, you saved us.

1648
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:40,620
 And so I pray, Father, we too would save others.

1649
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,620
 We'd save them

1650
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,620
 by speaking the truth in love. We'd save them by

1651
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,620
 looking to ourself.

1652
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:48,620
 Assu, we too be tempted.

1653
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:52,620
 First getting the log out of our own eye and then in

1654
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,620
 gentleness, with kindness, speaking the

1655
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,620
 truth, no matter what they say to us.

1656
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,620
 Make us men.

1657
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,620
 Make us godly women.

1658
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,620
 Make us teachers and

1659
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,620
 prophets and evangelists for you.

1660
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,620
 Send us forth

1661
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,620
 to this city, to our roommates,

1662
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,620
 families and world. For the glory

1663
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,620
 of Christ and the good of your people in Jesus name I pray.

1664
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,620
 Amen.
