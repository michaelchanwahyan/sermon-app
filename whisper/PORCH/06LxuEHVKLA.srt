1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
 (drum roll)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,940
 - So last week, moving into launch,

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,540
 I was talking to my friend Garrett Rayburn,

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,180
 and we were writing this message together,

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,620
 and we both had gone to Washington, D.C. separately.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,280
 It was the first time I had ever been there,

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,120
 was in the eighth grade,

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,720
 the first time I ever got on an airplane,

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,560
 was the eighth grade trip to Washington, D.C.,

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,020
 and then I went back recently for a conference there.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,800
 And Garrett and I were talking about

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,300
 a real similar experience that we had,

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,400
 and so when you go to D.C., what stands out to you

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,800
 is all these huge buildings,

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,840
 these huge memorials and monuments,

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,680
 and all these sorts of things.

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,380
 And so you see the White House is just a huge structure.

18
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,780
 You see the Supreme Court, the big pillars,

19
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,140
 enormous, ornate structure.

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,920
 I mean, even the Smithsonian Museum

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,320
 is just kind of this similar architecture.

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,480
 You see the Washington Monument,

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,660
 this enormous stone structure.

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,160
 You see the Lincoln Memorial, this enormous stone statue.

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,020
 But what stood out to both he and I

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,200
 were not those huge, grand statues, monuments, memorials.

27
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,660
 What stood out to Garrett and I,

28
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,400
 the same thing that we were talking about

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,740
 were these little bitty, tiny monuments.

30
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,740
 In fact, fields, miles of little, tiny monuments

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:24,320
 in Arlington Cemetery.

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,500
 These were guys who had given their life for a mission,

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,840
 and I don't know if you ever thought about this before,

34
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,140
 but the mission was not their own.

35
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,340
 The mission was something that someone else

36
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,520
 had asked them to do, and as they fulfilled that mission,

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,020
 it cost them everything.

38
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:53,660
 And I think this is so different to the mission

39
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,060
 and the message and the purpose

40
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,400
 that you're fed in media and in songs.

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,500
 As we move through a series called Lyrics and Lies,

42
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,140
 we're talking about the messages of songs.

43
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,340
 That one we just heard by Iggy

44
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,480
 is this idea that you're so fancy, right?

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,680
 It's all about you, you get yours,

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,220
 get your money, get your paper, she says.

47
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,580
 And what's funny is that's not unique to that song at all.

48
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,920
 In fact, as I just looked,

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,560
 I spent the last several weeks looking at the top 100 songs

50
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,400
 of 2014 and 2013, and as I scrubbed 200 songs,

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,940
 I saw a very, very common theme.

52
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,000
 It's this self-actualization.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,300
 You find your purpose within you,

54
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,440
 which is to get yours and to build your kingdom,

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,280
 and it drives us towards this narcissistic focus.

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,020
 And we can look, I mean, I'll give you a couple samples

57
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,460
 real quick, like Kanye West, "Good Life," right?

58
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,560
 Like, I think we have a sound sample of it.

59
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,400
 I go for mine, I get to shine, so.

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,100
 Okay, you guys don't listen, it's not Christian, I get it.

61
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,300
 [audience laughs]

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,980
 That's cool, no, I respect that.

63
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,080
 Katy Perry, "Roar," right?

64
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,280
 I think we got a sample.

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,240
 Self-actualization, I stood for nothing,

66
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,440
 but now I'm gonna stand for everything.

67
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,720
 You can't hold me down, I'm gonna get up,

68
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
 I'm gonna get mine.

69
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,680
 It's the same message, same thing as Iggy, right?

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,280
 We don't need to play it, you just heard it,

71
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,580
 this idea of fancy, it's the same message

72
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,280
 over and over and over.

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,200
 I gotta shine, I get mine, got my nose to the grind,

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
 and a girl with a nice behind, right?

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
 And then every day, after day, after day, I hit rewind.

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,000
 And do it all over again.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,340
 It's this message.

78
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,480
 It's this message.

79
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,280
 Get laid.

80
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,140
 Get paid.

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,440
 Get paid.

82
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,940
 And try to upgrade.

83
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,680
 Over and over and over again.

84
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,380
 This is what you've got, hey, you get laid, get paid,

85
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,280
 and try to climb that ladder, try to upgrade,

86
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,320
 try to get something better,

87
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,260
 try to move on to another season.

88
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,820
 Doesn't that fly in the face of this message in Scripture

89
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,620
 that there's a mission for you?

90
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,860
 I think about 2 Timothy 2, verses three and four.

91
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,180
 Join me in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

92
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,220
 That's so different than Kanye's message.

93
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,860
 Pursue comfort.

94
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,620
 And Jesus says, no, pursue your mission.

95
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,500
 Like a good soldier of Christ Jesus,

96
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,760
 no one serving as a soldier gets entangled

97
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,920
 in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,740
 his commanding officer.

99
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:46,220
 I think we're so obsessed with finding our purpose

100
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,540
 and knowing our mission.

101
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,980
 Like it's like our whole life, we've been on this track,

102
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,380
 we've been cruising, you know, it starts in kindergarten

103
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,980
 to first grade, first grade to second grade,

104
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,220
 second grade to third grade, you get to high school,

105
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,180
 then you move to college, freshman, sophomore, junior,

106
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,500
 senior, maybe grad school, and then all of a sudden

107
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,340
 the train comes off the tracks and you're like,

108
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,700
 okay, what's my purpose, what do I do, what's my mission,

109
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,840
 where do I go, I gotta find meaning.

110
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,300
 I think that's what so many of us tonight

111
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,540
 were searching for is where can I find meaning,

112
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,980
 where can I find my place in this world,

113
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,940
 where can I unleash the gifts that God has entrusted to me

114
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,180
 and find my mission, what's my calling,

115
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,320
 what am I going to do?

116
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,700
 And I don't think we want an answer to the question

117
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,580
 as much as we do self-discovery, this journey

118
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,600
 where we're taking disc tests and strength finders

119
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,660
 and am I an otter, a beaver, a golden retriever, a lion,

120
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,380
 like what am I, so I can find out what I'm supposed to do,

121
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,520
 right, Myers-Briggs.

122
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,300
 So tonight I want to talk about living your mission,

123
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,660
 specifically move through how you get your mission,

124
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,180
 what is your mission, and how you accomplish your mission.

125
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,700
 When I moved into this ministry, The Porch,

126
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,540
 that was my dream, in fact, the first thing I wanted to do

127
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,440
 was to change the name to The Mission,

128
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,520
 from The Porch to The Mission, because I just had this idea

129
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,200
 that young adults from all over the city,

130
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,060
 like the rich young rulers of Dallas,

131
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,100
 would come into this place and we would hand them

132
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,620
 military fatigues and a weapon and say,

133
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,180
 hey, now these are your marching orders,

134
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,420
 now go and die for this mission.

135
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,020
 And it's a metaphor, not literally fatigues and weapons

136
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,380
 and whatnot, but you are soldiers that you would march

137
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,100
 through this city and change this city,

138
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,140
 and we didn't change the name because The Porch,

139
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,060
 I found the same metaphor in The Porch,

140
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,260
 that you can sit on the front porch and you can see

141
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,940
 the needs of the city and meet the needs of the city,

142
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,380
 that this is our mission.

143
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,060
 And the Bible gives you a mission, if you're here

144
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,540
 and you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

145
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,020
 you need to look no longer for your mission,

146
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,280
 it tells you as plain as day why you were created.

147
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,440
 To set this up, I'm gonna be in John chapter 17.

148
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,440
 The disciples are realizing who Jesus is,

149
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,620
 they're kind of like, hey, there's something real special

150
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,620
 about you, Christ, like you seem to know things

151
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,620
 that only God can know, you must be God,

152
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,580
 you must be God's son, and so Jesus moves

153
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,580
 from talking to them to talking to God about them.

154
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,100
 And so you're going to get to, could you imagine

155
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,180
 getting to eavesdrop on one of Jesus's prayers?

156
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,140
 Getting to hear what Jesus would pray for?

157
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,260
 This is one of the most profound prayers

158
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,540
 of Christ in the scripture, you're gonna get

159
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,640
 to eavesdrop on it, it's been documented

160
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,700
 so that you can listen to it.

161
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,300
 And so he says this in John 16, verse 33,

162
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,520
 he says, I told you these things so that you may have peace

163
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
 because in this world you will have trouble,

164
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,540
 but take heart, I have overcome the world.

165
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,260
 See, when Kanye calls you to mission, he says,

166
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,140
 hey, come live the good life, come and get comfortable

167
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,340
 over here, get yours, it's time to shine.

168
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,300
 When Jesus calls you to mission, he says, come and die.

169
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,460
 He says, the world's gonna hate you, it's going to be hard.

170
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,420
 It's real interesting, the contrast there.

171
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,020
 Come and go to war with me, for no soldier serving

172
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,840
 his master gets entangled in the civilian affairs.

173
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,960
 And then he begins to pray for them.

174
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,320
 Verse 17, chapter 17, verse one.

175
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,680
 After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed,

176
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,340
 Father, the hour has come, glorify your son

177
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,160
 that your son may glorify you.

178
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,200
 For you granted him authority over all people

179
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,000
 that he might give eternal life to all those

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,400
 you have given him.

181
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,700
 Now this is eternal life, that they know you,

182
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,200
 the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.

183
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,380
 I have brought you glory on earth by finishing

184
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,000
 the work you gave me to do.

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,200
 You see that, finishing the work you, Father,

186
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,380
 gave me to do, Jesus says, and now, Father,

187
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,660
 glorify me in your presence with the glory

188
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,700
 I had with you before the world began.

189
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,300
 I have revealed you to those whom you gave me

190
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,620
 out of the world.

191
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,900
 They were yours, and you gave them to me,

192
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
 and they have obeyed your word.

193
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,880
 It says that Jesus received his mission from God.

194
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,340
 It says, I'm finishing the work that you gave me to do.

195
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,620
 Can you, do you guys understand this?

196
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,540
 Jesus, the most powerful man that has ever walked

197
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,520
 the face of the planet, only did what he was told.

198
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,840
 That's not really ambitious, is it?

199
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,300
 The most polarizing character in the history of the world,

200
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,980
 the most infamous character, notorious character,

201
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,180
 famous character, most well-known person ever to live,

202
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,980
 only did what he was told.

203
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,820
 There's something that we can learn from that.

204
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,220
 He says, Father, I've done everything.

205
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,060
 I am finishing the work you gave me to do.

206
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,460
 This is the most influential man

207
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,500
 in the history of the world.

208
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,300
 And he says, I only do what you said.

209
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,780
 Could you imagine this conversation with him?

210
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,380
 Hey, Jesus, what are your goals in life?

211
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,000
 Whatever my Father wants me to do.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,740
 Okay, Jesus, well, what is your agenda?

213
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,980
 My agenda is the Father's agenda.

214
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,860
 Okay, Jesus, well, what is your plan?

215
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,980
 My plan is whatever the plan that the Father entrusts

216
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,900
 to me is, that's what I'm here to do.

217
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,940
 I'm here to carry out a mission

218
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,860
 that I didn't try to create, it was given to me.

219
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,460
 That's my first point this evening,

220
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,180
 that your mission is received, not created.

221
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,460
 Some of you are trying to create your mission.

222
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,340
 You're looking at your gifts and your strengths

223
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,980
 and who you are and where you are,

224
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,020
 and you're like, okay, what is my purpose

225
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,380
 and how can I create it, how can I manufacture it?

226
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,640
 But missions, when you go on an assignment,

227
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,220
 it always comes from a commanding officer

228
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,340
 where they sit you down and say,

229
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,060
 hey, this is why you're here, this is what I want you to do,

230
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,480
 and the Christian mission is no different.

231
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,240
 It's not created, it is entrusted to you.

232
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,020
 Do you guys believe that you were created by God?

233
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,260
 Head nods, hopefully, if you're a Christ follower,

234
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,960
 I believe God is sovereign, he created me,

235
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,260
 formed me in my mother's womb,

236
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,020
 knows how many hairs are on my head, Scripture says.

237
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,080
 Can you think, like almost everything

238
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,720
 that is strategically made is made for a purpose.

239
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,860
 Like you don't strategically create something

240
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,920
 and then figure out its purpose, do you?

241
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,720
 I mean, it's not like they made the iPhone

242
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,900
 and they said, okay, now let's figure out

243
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,160
 what it can do, you know?

244
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,200
 You know, I think it could work as a hammer.

245
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,040
 No, no, it was made for a purpose.

246
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,320
 Oh, it makes calls, it sends emails,

247
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,920
 it was made for a specific purpose.

248
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,280
 You are no different.

249
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,760
 You're not trying to create your purpose,

250
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,460
 your purpose has already been given to you,

251
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,120
 your mission has already been entrusted to you,

252
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,140
 you need to read it and obey it.

253
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,340
 It's not something you're creating,

254
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,980
 it is something that you receive from your master.

255
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,960
 And so Jesus' mission was given to him,

256
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,560
 but is it true for his followers?

257
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,400
 I wanna make an argument that it is,

258
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
 it absolutely has been given to us as well,

259
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,580
 it's been given to you as well.

260
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,440
 We see this in Acts 20, verse 24,

261
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,160
 Paul says that his mission was given to him,

262
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,520
 he says, "I consider my life worth nothing to me.

263
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,400
 "My only aim is to finish the race

264
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,280
 "and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me,

265
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,220
 "the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace.

266
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,060
 "I'm trying to carry out the task that has been given me,

267
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,040
 "my mission has been given to me."

268
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,260
 He's just doing what God has told him to do.

269
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,860
 And this is all throughout the scriptures, right?

270
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,720
 So the expansion of the early church,

271
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,860
 there wasn't like this, hey, everybody gather around,

272
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,980
 let's get a whiteboard and let's kinda draw out

273
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,960
 where we're gonna do and come up with a strategy.

274
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,220
 No, it was as simple as Paul saying,

275
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,820
 hey, God, what would you have me do?

276
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,300
 Okay, guys, this is what we're gonna do.

277
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,820
 Okay, God, what would you have me do?

278
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,420
 Okay, guys, this is what we're going to do.

279
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,920
 He is a soldier carrying out his mission

280
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,860
 given to him by his commanding officer.

281
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,340
 And this is true for the prophets as well.

282
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,180
 The prophet Isaiah says, hey, I'm carrying out

283
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,000
 the very things the Lord has given to me.

284
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,240
 I'm giving to the people the very word

285
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,340
 that the Lord has entrusted to me.

286
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,380
 This is true, did you know, for the Holy Spirit.

287
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,220
 The Holy Spirit, who is God,

288
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,380
 says I don't say anything that the Father

289
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,320
 hasn't told me to say.

290
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,100
 I don't ask you to do anything.

291
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,400
 The Holy Spirit, who is God,

292
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,700
 is only doing what God has told him to do.

293
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,800
 That comes from John chapter 16, verse 13.

294
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,300
 So you know I'm not just making that up.

295
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,500
 Jesus, who was God, is only relaying instruction

296
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,840
 from God the Father, that's John 14, 10.

297
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,580
 He says I'm only telling you

298
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,840
 what the Father has told me to do.

299
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,340
 I'm only doing the very things

300
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,920
 the Father has commanded me to do.

301
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,820
 And so in summary, the apostles, the prophets,

302
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,420
 the Holy Spirit, and Jesus were carrying out

303
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,460
 God's mission for them, not looking for their own mission.

304
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,620
 And we are no different.

305
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,260
 You're not looking for your own mission.

306
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,360
 You're carrying out the mission that God has for you.

307
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,500
 We love to know that God has plans for us.

308
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,840
 Okay, Jeremiah 29, 11, anyone?

309
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,200
 We love verses like this.

310
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,040
 I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord.

311
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,240
 Plans to prosper you, not to harm you.

312
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,280
 We love to know that God has plans for us.

313
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,640
 We memorize things like Proverbs 3, 5, and 6,

314
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,580
 says trust in the Lord with all your heart

315
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,980
 and lead not on your own understanding,

316
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,320
 but in all your ways acknowledge him

317
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,020
 and he will direct your paths or make your paths straight.

318
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,060
 We love knowing that God has a plan for us.

319
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,920
 We love seeing that in scripture, verses like Ephesians 2, 10

320
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,660
 for we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus

321
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,200
 to do good works which God has prepared

322
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,700
 in advance for us to do.

323
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,200
 God has plans for me.

324
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,080
 We love to know that God has plans for us.

325
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,160
 We just don't like it when we see what they are.

326
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,020
 Okay, we love to know that he has plans,

327
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,820
 but when we see what those plans are,

328
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,560
 we're like what else?

329
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,000
 (congregation laughing)

330
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Where's the husband in there?

331
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,500
 Where's the white picket fence in there?

332
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,400
 Where's the good life in there, God?

333
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
 Where is it?

334
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,040
 Like give me, okay, yeah, I know I'm supposed to do that,

335
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,080
 but what else am I supposed to do?

336
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,000
 What else do you have for me to do?

337
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,580
 I see this all the time in young adults.

338
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,960
 I remember specifically one interview that I had with a guy.

339
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,020
 He was interviewing on staff here at Watermark,

340
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,320
 and the dude was gifted, and I had heard about him.

341
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,900
 I'd heard he was coming from this church

342
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,060
 where he had been for over a year,

343
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,400
 and he pulls up, he's impressive looking,

344
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,160
 like just to tell you, 'cause you can't,

345
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,300
 it's hard to meet with someone and not kind of grab

346
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,140
 the contact clues as possibly as you can,

347
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,940
 and the dude pulls up in this black BMW,

348
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,280
 and he gets out, and he's real impressive looking,

349
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,180
 and I'm like, okay, this dude's worldly.

350
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,880
 He probably doesn't know Jesus, which is sin on my part.

351
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,680
 I admit, I'm just being transparent.

352
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,980
 That's what I thought, and I sit down with him,

353
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,460
 and it's me and Blake, and we're interviewing the dude,

354
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,660
 and Blake says, "Do you know Philippians 4.5?"

355
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,400
 And he kind of pauses, and Blake goes,

356
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,720
 "A lot of people know Philippians 4.6.

357
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,960
 "Do not be anxious about anything but in everything

358
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,160
 "about prayer and petition, present your request to God,

359
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,460
 "and the peace of God which transcends all understanding

360
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,660
 "will guard your heart, mind, and the Christ Jesus."

361
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,460
 He goes, "But do you know Philippians 4.5?"

362
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,440
 And the guy stops for a second, and he's like

363
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,300
 saying stuff under his breath, and I'm like,

364
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
 "Hey, what are you, what are you,

365
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,700
 "you speaking in tongues right now, bro?

366
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,240
 "What are you, what are you doing?"

367
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,140
 And he goes, "Well, I know Philippians.

368
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,820
 "I'm just trying to get to chapter four, verse five."

369
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,680
 I'm like, "What do you mean you know Philippians?

370
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,180
 "Oh, you memorize Philippians?

371
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,960
 "Like the whole book?"

372
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,760
 And he's like, "Yeah."

373
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,100
 And I'm like, "Oh, wow, okay."

374
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,460
 And so what happened, it began,

375
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
 became unbelievably apparent that this guy

376
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,200
 was not just physically impressive,

377
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
 but that his heart was impressive, too,

378
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,440
 that he really, really loved the Lord.

379
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,780
 Not just his mind was impressive,

380
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,340
 his mind was impressive, he was really smart,

381
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,840
 but he really loved the Lord, too.

382
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,040
 And so it just didn't make sense to me.

383
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,820
 His output didn't seem to match the input.

384
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,120
 Like as gifted as he was, it didn't seem,

385
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,320
 I mean, here's what I'm thinking.

386
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,680
 Like this dude should have the largest

387
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,720
 young adult ministry in the world.

388
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,860
 Like he's a really impressive guy,

389
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,820
 but what's going on?

390
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,160
 Like there's not something there.

391
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,520
 And as I got to spend time with him,

392
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,660
 I realized he was so driven

393
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,960
 that he kept driving past his mission,

394
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,740
 kept looking for it.

395
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,100
 He kept saying, "Okay, what's my mission?

396
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,000
 "What am I supposed to do and go and conquer?"

397
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,080
 And he never stopped and said,

398
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,280
 "Okay, how do I be faithful right here?"

399
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
 And so Todd picked up on that as well,

400
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,220
 our senior pastor, and just said,

401
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,240
 "Hey, you need to be faithful right where you are.

402
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,680
 "You're not looking for your mission.

403
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,620
 "Your mission has already been given to you.

404
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,660
 "Your mission is right in front of you.

405
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,460
 "You be faithful right where you are

406
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,300
 "before you try to go climb and conquer another mountain.

407
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,300
 "How faithful are you being right where you are?"

408
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
 And so you're like, "All right, JP,

409
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,500
 "what is God's mission for me?

410
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,340
 "If he has really outlined my mission, what is it?"

411
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,880
 Back in the verse, verse seven, John 17.

412
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,040
 "Now they know that everything you have given me,"

413
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,080
 Jesus is praying to God, the Father,

414
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,880
 "everything you have given me comes from you.

415
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,980
 "For I gave them the words you gave me

416
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,720
 "and they accepted them.

417
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,920
 "They knew with certainty that I came from you

418
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,960
 "and they believed that you sent me.

419
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,160
 "I pray for them," talking about the disciples,

420
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,260
 "I am not praying for the world,

421
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,660
 "but for those you have given me, for they are yours."

422
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,960
 Now why would Jesus say, "I'm not praying for the world"?

423
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,300
 This is his opportunity.

424
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,540
 Lord, I pray for the world.

425
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,040
 Would you heal the world?

426
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,140
 God, I pray for world peace.

427
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,940
 Would you just kind of explode the gospel over the world?

428
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,080
 I pray that everyone would believe in me right now.

429
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,780
 He says, "I'm not praying for the world

430
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,380
 "because they're in the world.

431
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,040
 "I pray for them, that they would carry out

432
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,680
 "my mission in the world.

433
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,960
 "If they carry out my mission in the world,

434
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,760
 "I don't need to pray for the world.

435
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,920
 "I pray for them to carry out my mission in the world.

436
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,060
 "I have given them your word and the world,"

437
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,000
 this is verse 14, "and the world has hated them,

438
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,500
 "for they are not of the world

439
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 "any more than I am of the world."

440
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,240
 My, Kanye says, "Be of the world."

441
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,180
 Jesus says, "You are not of the world.

442
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,780
 "If you are mine, you are not of the world."

443
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,820
 "My prayer is not that you take them out of the world,

444
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,020
 "but that you protect them from the evil one in the world.

445
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,660
 "They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.

446
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
 "Sanctify them by the truth.

447
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,820
 "Your word is truth.

448
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,520
 "As you sent me into the world,

449
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,560
 "I have sent them into the world."

450
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,060
 You have been sent now.

451
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,260
 You have a mission.

452
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,840
 You've been sent on mission into the world.

453
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,200
 And so what is our mission?

454
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,400
 It's the same thing.

455
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,800
 He says, "Just as you have sent me,

456
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,100
 "I'm sending them to do this."

457
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,200
 The very same mission you sent me to do,

458
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,780
 which is in verse four and six,

459
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,180
 says, "Jesus was sent to glorify the Father

460
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,040
 "by revealing him to those he has chosen out of the world."

461
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,580
 Jesus was sent to bring God glory

462
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,120
 by revealing God the Father to those

463
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,760
 who are elect in the world.

464
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,060
 What I mean by that,

465
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,260
 those who God has chosen out of the world,

466
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,360
 your mission is to reveal God the Father to them.

467
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
 That is why you are alive.

468
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,200
 You do not wanna get to the end of this race

469
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,340
 and realize that you have missed your mission.

470
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,780
 The reason God has left you here

471
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,900
 is so that you would carry out that mission

472
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,400
 and reveal God to those he has chosen out of this world.

473
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,740
 How do I know who he's chosen out of this world?

474
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,740
 I guess you gotta reveal him to everyone

475
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,840
 and he gets to choose, right?

476
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,880
 I don't know how you know he's chosen out of the world.

477
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,040
 The ones that listen to your message.

478
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,880
 What if they don't listen?

479
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,080
 They're not gonna listen.

480
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,920
 What if they hate me?

481
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,180
 They're going to hate you.

482
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,820
 He's made that abundantly clear.

483
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,920
 But that's your mission.

484
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 You're on mission carrying that message forward

485
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,920
 so that others would know God and trust in him.

486
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,860
 To say it as plainly as I can,

487
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,700
 your mission is to be and make disciples.

488
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,900
 My second point this evening,

489
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,240
 your mission is to be and make disciples.

490
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,080
 This is your mission.

491
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,580
 This is the biggest calling on your life,

492
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,780
 to be and make disciples.

493
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,880
 I can make it no more.

494
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,720
 What is the disciple?

495
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,880
 A follower of Jesus.

496
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,420
 To be a follower of Jesus

497
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,020
 is to make a follower of Jesus, guys.

498
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,160
 This is why you're alive.

499
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,120
 You spend more time doing this

500
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,300
 than you do trying to have fun.

501
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,360
 You spend more time doing this

502
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,660
 than looking for a significant other.

503
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,260
 You spend more time doing this

504
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,340
 than idolizing an apartment or a car or a house

505
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,340
 or anything else.

506
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,940
 More time doing this than trying to get promoted.

507
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,440
 More time doing this than working.

508
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,980
 More time doing this than anything else

509
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,540
 you could possibly do.

510
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,180
 The calling on your life is to be

511
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,840
 and make followers of Jesus Christ.

512
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,940
 Kanye says live your life for you.

513
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,480
 Jesus says live your life for everyone around you

514
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,240
 so that they might know the Father.

515
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,920
 This is life on mission.

516
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,580
 And so we learn a lot from what Jesus prays,

517
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,920
 but we also learn a lot from what Jesus doesn't pray.

518
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,920
 He doesn't say, God, thank you for this day.

519
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,120
 Help us to have a good week.

520
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,720
 Father, I pray that you would help

521
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,020
 Peter get that promotion.

522
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,700
 Father, I pray that you would help them

523
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,600
 to be true to themselves and follow their hearts

524
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,060
 and get a good job and have a good life.

525
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,340
 Father, I pray that you would help them

526
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,740
 accomplish their dreams.

527
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,140
 Everything they want, would you give it to them, God?

528
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,240
 Help them to get married and have two kids

529
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,980
 and a German shepherd and a white picket fence?

530
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,520
 He prays, Father, I'm sending them to do

531
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,640
 what you have sent me to do.

532
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,660
 To show a world who will hate them who you are

533
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,920
 so that the elect might come to know you.

534
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:28,760
 I used to, when I became a follower of Jesus Christ

535
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,060
 I realized that there was this thing called heaven

536
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,260
 and I was gonna get to go there.

537
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,640
 And as I learned about how amazing it was,

538
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,800
 I began to pray to die.

539
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,340
 I know that's weird, but every night I would just say,

540
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,300
 Lord, pray I don't wake up, take me home.

541
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,340
 And I wasn't depressed, like life was good,

542
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,620
 but I just saw that heaven was amazing.

543
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,540
 And I would talk to people and they would say things

544
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,820
 like this, they would say, oh, there's just things

545
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,420
 I wanna experience here.

546
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,760
 Like what, like it's heaven?

547
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,560
 Like, well, I wanna get married or I wanna walk my kids

548
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,160
 down the aisle, I wanna see places of the world.

549
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,340
 No, no, no, none of those reasons are why

550
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,540
 you wanna stay here.

551
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,440
 If that was it, you would wanna die and go to heaven.

552
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,180
 God has left you here so that you would know him

553
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,580
 and make him known, that's it.

554
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,540
 That's why I see the sin in my prayer before,

555
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,080
 my prayer to die.

556
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,380
 No, no, God's not done with me.

557
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,860
 He'll take me when he's done with me.

558
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,020
 Until then, like I'm here because God hasn't answered

559
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,420
 that prayer so that I can tell you your mission

560
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,900
 is to be and make disciples.

561
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,060
 This is how you're going to change the world.

562
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,640
 By following Jesus and making followers of Jesus,

563
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,800
 there is no other plan.

564
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,500
 There is nothing else that you can do with your life

565
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,680
 of any eternal significance than to follow Christ

566
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,420
 and have others follow Christ.

567
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,920
 Everything else you do is eternally wasteful.

568
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,280
 Okay, everything else you do.

569
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,620
 Now, I'm not saying that God cannot be glorified

570
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,760
 or delight in you as you have fun, that's fine,

571
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,860
 but you have fun even as you have fun,

572
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,920
 you have fun on mission, that you would be

573
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,860
 and make followers of Jesus Christ.

574
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:18,360
 And you cannot accomplish that mission

575
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,280
 unless you are investing into the lives of others.

576
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,640
 You cannot do it, let me say that again.

577
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,680
 You cannot carry out the calling on your life

578
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,520
 unless you are investing into the lives of others.

579
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,820
 And the good news is you don't have to take Myers-Briggs

580
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,060
 or disc or strength finder or know if you're

581
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,420
 an otter, beaver, lion or a golden retriever

582
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,820
 or anything else.

583
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,020
 You're a follower of Jesus Christ and the mission

584
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,200
 is right in front of you that you would be

585
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,560
 and make followers of him.

586
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,840
 And you say, man, you pulled that from his prayer,

587
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,100
 that's not real clear in his prayer.

588
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,980
 Like, are we sure that's my mission?

589
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,480
 Let me give it to you, it's Matthew 28, verse 18.

590
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,940
 Then Jesus came to them and said,

591
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,320
 this is the resurrected Christ.

592
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,360
 One of his last words, you're choosing your words

593
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,720
 carefully when you're about to leave.

594
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,280
 All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me,

595
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,500
 therefore go and make disciples of all nations,

596
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,720
 baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son

597
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,160
 and of the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey

598
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,560
 everything I have commanded you and surely I am with you

599
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,160
 always to the very end of the age.

600
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,700
 Jesus says, all authority has been given to me

601
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,580
 and so I'm commanding you as my soldiers to go

602
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,240
 and make disciples everywhere you go in all of the land

603
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,080
 and because they carried out that mission,

604
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,380
 we get to follow Christ.

605
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,920
 And in your scripture, that's called the great commission

606
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,960
 'cause Jesus says, I will go with you always,

607
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,400
 I will be with you.

608
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,280
 It's you and Jesus that mission together.

609
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,800
 I wanna be with Jesus.

610
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,880
 If you wanna be with Jesus, you carry out his work

611
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,940
 and it says he's with you.

612
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,500
 We all want, hey, I want Jesus, I want the Jesus is with me

613
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,680
 always to the very end of the age.

614
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,480
 Don't forget the first part, go and make disciples.

615
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,840
 Baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son

616
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,140
 and the Holy Spirit.

617
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,440
 Man, like just to be totally transparent with you,

618
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,240
 I wanna be cool, okay?

619
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,780
 I want you to think I'm cool.

620
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,880
 I wanna dress cool and I just wanna appear to be cool

621
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,340
 and I wanna talk cool.

622
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,520
 This has always been a desire of mine

623
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,560
 as long as I was around people, I wanted to be cool

624
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,000
 and wanted to be perceived as cool.

625
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,300
 And then when I came into ministry,

626
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,520
 I pulled that desire with me.

627
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,440
 Still wanna be cool, like even right now

628
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,780
 as I'm standing here.

629
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,440
 I want you to think this shirt's cool, okay?

630
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,280
 Even if you don't.

631
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,240
 And I'm in Houston and I'm sharing there at Metro

632
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,960
 and this guy picks me up from the airport every Thursday

633
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,520
 and we get in his very uncool car.

634
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,820
 And I don't mean to hate if you're listening,

635
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,580
 but he's wearing some uncool clothes

636
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,400
 and he didn't talk cool.

637
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,740
 And as we were talking, I realized this,

638
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,500
 man, this guy's main mission in life

639
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,300
 is to make disciples, make followers of Jesus Christ.

640
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,620
 And as I got to talk to other people,

641
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,460
 they said, oh man, Don picked you up from the airport?

642
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,540
 Yeah, oh bro, that guy has had such an impact on my life.

643
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,580
 And I'm like, well, you're a pastor now.

644
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,060
 I wasn't even a Christian until I met Don.

645
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,900
 What?

646
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,280
 Yeah, he would just sit down with me.

647
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,460
 There were like 12 of us there

648
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,320
 and he would just teach us the Bible.

649
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,640
 And it dawned on me that that dude's gonna have

650
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,540
 a better eternity than I'm gonna have.

651
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,920
 Not that it's about performance,

652
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,360
 but it is about discipleship.

653
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,640
 We're saved by grace, I know that.

654
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,640
 It's God's doing in spite of you.

655
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,320
 But he says you can store up treasures there

656
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,880
 forever and ever and ever.

657
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,480
 And that dude is storing up treasures.

658
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,680
 He's not distracted by Kanye's message

659
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,720
 or Iggy's message or Katy Perry's message.

660
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,280
 He is focused on Jesus' message

661
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,020
 and therefore he's focused on Jesus' mission.

662
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:07,040
 And I was like, man, I wanna be focused on Jesus' mission.

663
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,320
 See, a non-reproducing Christian,

664
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,680
 a Christian who does not reproduce themselves into others

665
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,600
 is not a biblical Christian.

666
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,180
 It may not be a Christian.

667
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,920
 Like that seems that when the Holy Spirit

668
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,920
 regenerates a heart, the Holy Spirit uses that person

669
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,000
 to continue to invest in others.

670
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,200
 And so you say, well, wait a minute,

671
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,240
 I don't know my Bible.

672
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,780
 Well, that might be part one of your mission.

673
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,880
 Learn the Bible and teach the Bible.

674
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,360
 I mean, it can't get any more simpler, right?

675
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,640
 Know God and make him known, okay?

676
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,480
 Well, I don't know God.

677
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,560
 Okay, well, then let's work on that.

678
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,920
 Know God.

679
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,660
 Know God, you know, you become a Christian

680
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,480
 by trusting that Jesus Christ has died for your sins

681
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,220
 and that God raised him from the dead.

682
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,400
 And if you trust in that, that he paid the price

683
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,520
 for your sins, then you will be with God forever

684
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,560
 just as he is.

685
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,080
 He got what you deserve, you get what he deserves.

686
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,240
 And then he has this book, which is the Holy Scriptures,

687
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,200
 God breathed, it says, and you learn that.

688
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,420
 And there's eternal truths in there

689
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,960
 that you can apply to your life,

690
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,120
 but you also learn about God.

691
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,680
 And then you begin to teach that to others,

692
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,920
 just one verse at a time, one principle at a time.

693
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,120
 There's so many resources.

694
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,960
 There's never been more resources available to you

695
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,740
 than right now, today, 2014,

696
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,240
 that you would know God and make him known.

697
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,880
 And so you're like, well, what is my mission?

698
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,840
 To make disciples.

699
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,660
 Do what, Jesus?

700
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,500
 What am I supposed to do?

701
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,320
 Make disciples.

702
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
 It's not that simple, Jesus.

703
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,880
 It's that simple, go and make disciples.

704
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,560
 Well, what if there's resistance, Jesus?

705
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,440
 There will be, and right now you're the resistance.

706
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,600
 Go and make disciples.

707
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,460
 It's that simple.

708
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,000
 Go and make followers of Jesus Christ, verse 20.

709
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,360
 My prayer is not for them alone.

710
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,120
 I pray also for those who will believe in me

711
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,880
 through their message.

712
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,520
 This is Jesus praying for those who will believe

713
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,640
 in the message that the apostles

714
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,040
 or the disciples carried forward.

715
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,880
 Who is that?

716
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,200
 Sometimes people come up here afterwards

717
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,040
 and they want me to pray for them,

718
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,920
 and like other volunteers ask to offer,

719
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,800
 I'll pray for you, and they're like, no,

720
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,440
 I want JP to pray for me.

721
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,520
 And I'm like, man, and I'm encouraged by that.

722
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,480
 Like, I wanna pray for you,

723
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,800
 but my prayers are just as powerful

724
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,320
 as any of these other pastors up here.

725
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,640
 Not any more powerful.

726
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,960
 But if you think so, this is God in the flesh,

727
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,060
 Jesus Christ praying for you.

728
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,960
 That you would know his message,

729
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,720
 and you know that you being here tonight

730
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,600
 is evidence of God working through that prayer

731
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,160
 a couple thousand years ago.

732
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,480
 That you would be here.

733
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,520
 We're changing the world through the lives of young adults.

734
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,240
 And so my third point is that you cannot

735
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,160
 accomplish your mission alone.

736
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,080
 You cannot accomplish your mission alone.

737
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,320
 Individuality is the message of fancy

738
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,160
 and roar and good life.

739
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,760
 It's the message of the world, it's be your own person.

740
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,440
 Be your own person is an anti-biblical message.

741
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,680
 Be your own person is an anti-biblical message.

742
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,080
 Let me give it to you, verse 21.

743
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,400
 That all of them may be one.

744
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,760
 Father, just as you are in me and I am in you,

745
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,800
 may they also be in us so that the world

746
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,480
 may believe that you have sent me.

747
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,040
 Jesus wants us to belong to his body, the church.

748
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,900
 That we would be a part of this mission together.

749
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,300
 That a key part of our mission is doing it

750
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,380
 with other Christians.

751
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,200
 That we would leave here with our fatigues

752
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,560
 and not go our separate ways and not die alone,

753
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,280
 but die in our troops.

754
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,800
 That we would be in troops,

755
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,600
 that we would go through this world belonging to a body,

756
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
 accountable under the authority of elders

757
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,980
 at a specific place, yoked with other people,

758
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,340
 expressing our gifts through his body,

759
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,560
 through his mission called the church.

760
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
 It's not a building, it's a people.

761
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,560
 It's always been a people, it's never been a building.

762
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,880
 It is a people that you would leave here together

763
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,200
 and change Dallas and change the world together

764
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,360
 through his church.

765
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,080
 Says this.

766
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,580
 (congregation applauding)

767
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,400
 Here's an email I wrote to my team this week

768
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,000
 and we just got back from lunch.

769
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,680
 It must be something really special to train

770
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,360
 with a specific troop of soldiers.

771
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,640
 Every day you wake up and only to sit

772
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,160
 in the same huddle of people again.

773
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,440
 You eat together, you practice your skills together,

774
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,100
 you sharpen each other and make each other better.

775
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,320
 Pretty soon, a part of your identity

776
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,720
 is really a shared identity of your troops.

777
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,640
 You become a piece of a bigger unit,

778
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,360
 a team of soldiers who share a common vision

779
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,880
 to be equipped to carry out a mission,

780
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,480
 a common mission, which is to destroy the enemy

781
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,980
 and honor the captain.

782
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,580
 I imagine in that sort of training,

783
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,180
 you grow some pretty tight bonds.

784
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,440
 When you shoot together and work out together

785
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,940
 and run together every day,

786
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,360
 I imagine some deep friendships are made.

787
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,480
 Then, however, a day will come

788
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,180
 that you would go to war together.

789
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,480
 War is when the training is tested.

790
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,080
 War is when you go without sleep.

791
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,720
 In war, you are constantly looking to survive.

792
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,380
 In war, your muscles are fatigued and your mind is tired

793
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,240
 and new battles keep coming your way.

794
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,500
 I imagine in war, the troop you fight with

795
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,060
 is that much more important.

796
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,280
 I imagine in times of war,

797
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,160
 those friendships grow to another level.

798
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,560
 A bond is formed out of shared memories and stories,

799
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,000
 told or untold, that will last forever.

800
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,920
 And then I just told them, hey, this weekend

801
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,080
 at launch retreat, we've been at war together.

802
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,560
 And when we return to Dallas,

803
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,120
 let's continue to be at war together.

804
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,400
 Because there's evil in Dallas.

805
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,220
 There's evil in Fort Worth.

806
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,800
 There's evil in the Metroplex.

807
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,640
 There's evil in the world.

808
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,460
 And God has left us here.

809
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,720
 He didn't save you and then call you home

810
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,920
 right then to be with him.

811
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,360
 He said, no, you're my plan A.

812
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,120
 There is no plan B.

813
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,720
 You are the way that I'm going to save the world.

814
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,240
 I'm going to work through you

815
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,800
 and share the gospel through you

816
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,520
 and build the church through you.

817
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,000
 And I need your attention.

818
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,920
 And if you listen to Kanye's message,

819
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,080
 you're going to be distracted

820
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,720
 and pursuing comfort and trying to die easy,

821
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,280
 living the good life.

822
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,120
 He said, in this world, you will have trouble,

823
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,040
 but take heart, I've overcome the world.

824
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,960
 You've got to focus because I want to change

825
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,200
 the world through you.

826
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,840
 And I need you to get along

827
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,960
 so that you would be one unit.

828
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,760
 Says this, verse 22.

829
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,400
 I've given them the glory that you gave me,

830
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,320
 that they may be one as we are one,

831
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,480
 I in them and you in me,

832
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,040
 so that they may be brought to complete unity.

833
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,520
 Then the world will know that you sent me

834
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,760
 and have loved them even as you love me.

835
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:45,120
 The image is not just us fighting evil.

836
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:50,800
 The image is a powerful one of us gaining recruits,

837
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,800
 building our team, building our troops.

838
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,360
 When I was at launch, I was talking to this dude

839
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,400
 who was out there, he was an addict.

840
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,700
 He had his drugs with him.

841
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,640
 He said, I want to commit my life to Jesus.

842
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,760
 That which I was working against,

843
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,140
 the evil I was fighting, became part of my team

844
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,920
 and our team got stronger.

845
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,440
 Girls, like I'm focused on my body

846
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,760
 and I'm focused on boys.

847
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,420
 And I want to give my life to Jesus.

848
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,960
 I want to focus on Jesus.

849
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,400
 That which we were messaging against became a part of us

850
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,240
 and we got bigger and stronger.

851
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,560
 Guys stuck on themselves, narcissistic,

852
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
 ready to return to Dallas to get theirs.

853
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,040
 God grabbed ahold of their heart.

854
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,280
 They said, I want to join that mission

855
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,720
 and we strengthened.

856
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,480
 Not long ago, I was talking, I guess about a year

857
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,240
 and a half ago, I was talking with a young man

858
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,080
 who was addicted to getting high,

859
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,520
 you know, smoking weed and having sex.

860
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,540
 And he was like, I want to follow Jesus,

861
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,280
 but I don't know how to give these things up.

862
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,920
 And God grabbed ahold of his heart.

863
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,120
 And now I meet with him every week

864
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,640
 and he helps me write the very sermons you listen to.

865
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,920
 He informs them.

866
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,760
 And I'm about to do his wedding in a few months

867
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,380
 because God grabbed his heart and transformed his life

868
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,240
 that fast that he became a part of us

869
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,960
 and we became stronger.

870
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,320
 Six years ago, there was this girl,

871
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,880
 she wrote me today and just said,

872
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,320
 thank you for such an incredible, awesome weekend.

873
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,080
 It's because of God working through the porch

874
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,560
 six years ago that I was able to make

875
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,040
 that head-heart connection.

876
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,560
 I was able to hear and understand grace for the first time.

877
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,640
 And every year since, my heart has grown

878
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,000
 immeasurably more for him and his children.

879
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 And I looked at that and I'm like,

880
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,480
 that's the girl that's running our social media efforts.

881
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,480
 Like, people are trusting Christ through her effort.

882
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,200
 Like, all of a sudden, that day six years ago

883
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,800
 when she believed in God's grace

884
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,140
 and that was enough for her, we got stronger, man.

885
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,640
 We got stronger.

886
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,960
 That guy, the BMW guy, remember him?

887
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,440
 He was like so driven and so focused

888
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,880
 and so impressive that he missed his mission.

889
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,160
 I watched that guy grow for the last 12 months.

890
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,680
 That dude just continued to say, I'm here to serve,

891
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,980
 I wanna be faithful right where I'm at.

892
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,520
 That guy tonight, he has the largest young adult ministry

893
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,800
 in Fort Worth, Texas, that's Garrett Rayburn.

894
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,760
 And they're streaming right now.

895
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,320
 Fort Worth, we love you.

896
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,480
 Tonight is the first night they gathered

897
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,880
 over at the Ridgely Theater and they're sitting there,

898
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,640
 they're listening to the same message

899
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,360
 that you're hearing right now.

900
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,360
 Our mission strengthened when that guy said,

901
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,640
 I'm gonna be faithful right where I'm at

902
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,320
 and I'm gonna have God use the gifts

903
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,920
 that he entrusted to me right where I'm at

904
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,480
 to be and to make disciples.

905
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,500
 We got stronger, man.

906
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:47,760
 The mission of the porch has and always will be

907
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,120
 to make more fully devoted followers of Christ.

908
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,920
 We didn't create that mission, it was given to us.

909
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,920
 That mission, it is not self-centered but others-focused

910
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,100
 and we must carry out that mission together.

911
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:11,040
 So in closing, when we were at Launch Retreat,

912
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,880
 we were giving away prizes the last day

913
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,240
 and I was giving away a prize for whoever traveled there

914
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,400
 the farthest and somebody raised their hand

915
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,720
 and said, I came from Arizona.

916
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,960
 I said, all right, anybody further?

917
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,880
 Somebody else raised their hand.

918
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,320
 I came from Indianapolis and I was like,

919
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
 wow, that's pretty good.

920
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,200
 And then I saw a bunch of people pointing to this girl

921
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,760
 in the fourth row and I was like, wait,

922
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,600
 where'd you come from?

923
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,960
 And I realized who it was and she said,

924
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,600
 I came from Kyrgyzstan.

925
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,040
 Winner, you know, it's like, okay, game over.

926
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,440
 And so I came back and I did a search in my email

927
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,640
 and I got this email April 9th, 2013.

928
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,560
 Dear JP, you might receive tons of emails

929
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,360
 from all over Dallas and not only Dallas.

930
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,400
 I hope you have a minute to read my email.

931
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,080
 My name is Azeda and I'm a Christ follower from Kyrgyzstan.

932
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,880
 It is one of the ex-Soviet countries in Central Asia.

933
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,320
 I was blessed by one of your messages

934
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,120
 called Boy Meets Girl about two years ago

935
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,680
 during a tough time I was going through

936
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,480
 because of decisions I made.

937
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,160
 That was the first time I got to know about Watermark

938
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,080
 through my coworker in Afghanistan

939
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,000
 who was a Watermark member.

940
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,080
 Since then, I have been listening to Todd Wagner

941
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,520
 in your messages through Watermark Media

942
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,000
 and shared with other friends to listen as well.

943
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,520
 God used your message to draw me closer to him

944
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,400
 and gave me a desire to run after Christ.

945
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,920
 You might not know, but your messages have been listened to

946
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,680
 across the ocean, even in Muslim countries like Kyrgyzstan.

947
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,800
 I thank God for putting his people in churches

948
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,080
 like Watermark to spread his word.

949
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,820
 Sincerely, Azeda.

950
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,640
 And so she rededicated her life to Christ

951
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,140
 when a friend shared with her about, you know,

952
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,880
 the porch and what God was doing here.

953
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,200
 She jumped on a plane, she flew here.

954
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
 Somebody came up to my office and said,

955
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
 "Hey, there's two girls from Kyrgyzstan down here."

956
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,120
 I was like, "What are you guys doing?"

957
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,760
 They were like, "Well, we just wanna come and see the place

958
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,000
 "that had such an impact on our lives."

959
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 And so then they left, and now she's moved here

960
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,920
 and she's enrolled in Dallas Theological Seminary.

961
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,420
 She moved a couple weeks ago,

962
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,280
 and she's continuing to grow in that message.

963
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,560
 And there's also guys in Sweden,

964
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,640
 there's guys in Australia,

965
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,960
 there's a group that gathers every Tuesday in Chicago.

966
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,220
 There's all of these people that are hearing this message.

967
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,700
 And I tell you that because could you imagine

968
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,020
 how powerful it would be if we could take this message

969
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,660
 to all over the world, that people, young adults,

970
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,420
 specifically 20s and 30s something,

971
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,420
 could hear a message about Jesus from the scriptures

972
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,380
 relevant to their life stage in their 20s and 30s.

973
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,340
 Could you imagine how powerful that is?

974
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:39,340
 When I posted on social media about the Fort Worth campus,

975
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,800
 I got a bunch of responses of, "What about my city?

976
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,440
 "What about Boston?

977
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,400
 "What about Chicago, and what about Austin,

978
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,800
 "and what about San Antonio?"

979
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,760
 And so tonight we're launching a porch app,

980
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,780
 live stream, you can live stream the chains,

981
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,220
 you can live stream the message.

982
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,840
 And so in one moment right now, okay,

983
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,560
 we have young adult ministries in Cairo,

984
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,520
 young adult ministries in Tokyo,

985
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,320
 young adult ministries in LA,

986
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,520
 young adult ministries in Chicago, okay?

987
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,580
 And so we're taking this message of Jesus Christ

988
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,860
 and we're covering the world with it.

989
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,700
 We have--

990
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,040
 (congregation cheering)

991
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:24,120
 We had no idea when we came up with those shirts

992
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,700
 earlier this year that says 214 to the world,

993
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,160
 what God was going to do.

994
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,680
 I wanna be abundantly clear with you.

995
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,560
 I don't care about fame.

996
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,800
 I'm sure there's something wicked in me

997
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,160
 that wants it to be transparent.

998
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,520
 But I don't do this so that I can sell a bunch of books,

999
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,440
 I hadn't written one, okay?

1000
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,080
 Or so that David or JP or Todd Wagner can be famous.

1001
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,200
 I wanna give my life to making Jesus famous

1002
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,520
 because as Jesus takes root in the hearts of young adults,

1003
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,360
 they're going to take that message

1004
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,600
 and they're going to spread it.

1005
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,900
 But do you know what they're saying about you?

1006
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,560
 There's articles coming out every week, I read 'em.

1007
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,280
 It says the collapse of evangelicalism.

1008
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,560
 The collapse of the church is what they're calling it.

1009
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,840
 And you read it and you say, you know what?

1010
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,960
 These millennials, these Gen Yers,

1011
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,240
 they're so focused on themselves and their comforts

1012
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,880
 that the church is dying.

1013
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,120
 They have forgotten the commission.

1014
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,080
 They've been listening to Kanye.

1015
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,800
 And the church is dying.

1016
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,700
 And I'm telling you, may it never be.

1017
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,360
 Not on your generation, not on your watch, man.

1018
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,200
 You give your life to this mission.

1019
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,320
 May you have a small monument one day,

1020
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,160
 not even decorated, that says,

1021
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,040
 he, she gave her life for the mission.

1022
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,360
 What else you gonna do?

1023
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,440
 You think you're gonna get up there

1024
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,840
 and wish you had a higher paying job?

1025
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,060
 Or a husband?

1026
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,080
 Or kids?

1027
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,200
 Do you think you're gonna be sad

1028
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,160
 that you never got to walk your little girl

1029
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,000
 down the aisle up there?

1030
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,060
 Absolutely not.

1031
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,320
 Up there, you'll be watching the game tape

1032
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,440
 of all of the work that God did through you

1033
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,000
 while you were here, carrying out his mission here.

1034
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,540
 But don't be distracted by comfort.

1035
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,400
 Focus on the commission of Jesus Christ.

1036
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,000
 Him saying, I will work through you.

1037
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,600
 Okay, can I have your buy-in on that?

1038
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,840
 Can I get a head nod, like hey, we're in on that?

1039
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,440
 We're gonna leave here, we're gonna give our lives

1040
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,880
 for this mission, to be and to make disciples.

1041
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,520
 I'm not gonna worry anymore about my job

1042
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,360
 or where I'm at or how uncomfortable I am

1043
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,000
 or how small my bed is or whatever your worries are, okay?

1044
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,040
 I got a small bed and I want a bigger one.

1045
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,760
 (congregation laughing)

1046
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,160
 And so we have a ask of you.

1047
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,800
 Would you help us spread the word about this app?

1048
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,880
 We've invested a lot of time, it's free.

1066
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,200
 will you retweet it?

1067
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,360
 And here's why we're doing this.

1068
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,000
 Because we want the message of Jesus

1069
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,400
 to spread throughout the world

1070
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,480
 through the lives of young adults.

1071
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,320
 We are changing the world through the lives

1072
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,640
 of young adults, surrender to God.

1073
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,720
 Surrender to God, we are changing the world

1074
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,960
 through the lives of young adults.

1075
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,120
 That's what I wanna give my life to.

1076
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,540
 And that's what I want you to give your life to.

1077
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,860
 Okay, let me pray that we would as we move to worship.

1078
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,680
 Father, stir our hearts around the mission

1079
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,020
 that you have for us.

1080
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:11,240
 Father, thank you for Azeda and Simon

1081
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,360
 and people all over the world who are starting

1082
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,160
 young adult ministries in their living room.

1083
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,880
 And gathering people and saying, hey, let's sit around

1084
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,760
 and watch how God might use us,

1085
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,920
 how we might be moved towards mission.

1086
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,280
 Father, would you use us in those ways?

1087
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,440
 I pray you'd start right here with those here.

1088
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,640
 I pray you'd start with those in Fort Worth.

1089
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,440
 Thank you for the gathering there, I pray you'd bless it.

1090
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,040
 Thank you for Garrett and his leadership there

1091
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,680
 and those that you've raised up to be around him.

1092
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,880
 Father, I pray you would bless them.

1093
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,760
 We love you, God, it's in Jesus' name, amen.

1094
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,920
 (silence)

1095
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,080
 (silence)

1096
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,240
