[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:28.520]   All right, Ports of Dallas, how we doing?
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.800]   My name is Adam Tarnow.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.560]   Excited to be with you guys.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.840]   I want to welcome everybody at all the other Porsche Live
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.600]   locations and everybody watching online.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.840]   I'm excited to be here with you guys.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.920]   I think I'll just start off with a quick question.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.120]   Anybody ever had one of those moments in life
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.640]   where you just wanted to crawl and hide and not show
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.040]   your face for a long period of time?
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.840]   Well, since we've already connected so well,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.260]   I figured I'd go ahead and open up
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.000]   with one of my most embarrassing and shameful moments
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.560]   in my life.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.480]   And so just to set up a little bit of context,
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.800]   about 11 years ago, my wife and I were married.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.960]   And we didn't have any kids.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.760]   We were living in a cool part of Dallas.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.240]   This is back when we were cool.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.600]   And so we were living down in the M Streets area.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.080]   And so those of you that aren't in Dallas,
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.560]   you don't know that.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.040]   But everybody in this room knows that's
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.880]   where all the cool people are.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.920]   And so we were down there living in the M Streets.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920]   We didn't have any kids.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.340]   And so we did what a lot of young married couples will do,
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.160]   is we got a pet.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.480]   But we made a bad mistake, and we didn't get the dog.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.400]   We got a cat.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.400]   All right?
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.860]   And I know I just offended most of you.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.680]   But just wait.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.640]   It gets worse, OK?
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.300]   And so anyway, we got this cat.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.440]   And for a lot of reasons, we needed
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.880]   to let this cat be an outdoor cat.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.960]   And so usually the way things would go
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.480]   is we'd get home from running errands or whatever,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.200]   and the cat would be waiting on the porch
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.960]   to go inside and do whatever cats do.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960]   And this one Saturday afternoon--
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.440]   I remember it was in November--
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.360]   one Saturday afternoon, we come back after being gone all day,
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.420]   and the cat is not on the porch.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.440]   And I also had kind of an unhealthy relationship
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.480]   with this cat, meaning that I really liked it.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.040]   And so I had a little bit of anxiety when we drove in.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.880]   And I looked around, and I couldn't find the cat anywhere,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.520]   and just thought, that's strange.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.280]   And went inside, and we dropped off whatever groceries
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.820]   or whatever it was that we had.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.480]   And so I decided I'm going to go outside and try to find the cat.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.840]   And I'm walking around, and I can't find the cat anywhere.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.640]   I come inside.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.600]   I'm like, Jackie, have you seen the cat?
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.520]   No, I haven't seen it.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.600]   I go back outside.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.320]   And I'm in the backyard, and then I just
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.440]   hear this faint little cry.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.520]   And I'm starting to look around, and my heart's
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.060]   starting to beat a little bit faster.
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.480]   And I'm like, OK, where is he?
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.200]   Where is he?
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.960]   And I hear the cry, and I hear the cry.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.960]   And I look in my neighbor's yard up about 25 feet,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.440]   and I realize, oh, good Lord, my cat's 25 feet up in that tree.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.360]   And I don't know what to do, but I just kind of start to panic.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.880]   And so I'm like, oh, I'm going to get you, buddy.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.000]   And so I go running inside, and I'm like, Jackie,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.280]   Pedro is in the tree.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.200]   Pedro was his name.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.400]   And I'm like, Pedro's in the tree right now.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.520]   And she's just like, so?
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.600]   And I'm like, well, he's over there, and it's November.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.680]   It's supposed to get cold tonight.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.120]   It's starting to get dark outside.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.520]   What are we going to do to get him out of the tree?
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.640]   And it's like, she just looks at me, and she goes,
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.760]   have you ever seen a dead cat in a tree?
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.720]   And I was like, no.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.100]   And she's like, that's because they always come down, OK?
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.040]   They don't stay up there and just die.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.400]   And I'm like, but that's what-- you heartless woman.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.760]   That's our baby.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.560]   And so I really kind of start to panic,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.520]   and I'm trying to figure out, what am I going to do to get
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.480]   this cat down?
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.600]   I start looking around the apartment,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.360]   and I just gather anything I think I can throw up there.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.200]   And I kid you not, I go out there with tennis balls
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.280]   and rolls of paper towel, OK?
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.600]   And I go up there, and I'm like, chucking these tennis balls up
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.480]   at him, and I nail him in the side.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.880]   And he does not move an inch.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.920]   Like, he just digs down in more.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.640]   And the paper towels was just useless.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.440]   I don't know why I brought those out there.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.200]   I tried throwing them up there.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.720]   They went about 10 feet in the air and then came back down.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.560]   And so anyway, I go inside, and it's
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.320]   starting to get a little bit darker.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.240]   And I'm really starting to panic a little bit,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.640]   and I'm starting to wonder, what are we going to do to get
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.680]   this cat out of the tree?
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.400]   I can't let him stay out here all night.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.920]   And then just an idea popped into my mind
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.520]   is, sometimes I see on, like, Good Morning America
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.320]   that if you call the fire department,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.040]   they'll come get your cat out of the tree.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.360]   Well, I'm not going to call 911.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.520]   So I just Google "fire department in Dallas."
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.360]   And I find a phone number, and I call it.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.440]   It's like some office line.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.840]   And I don't know why on a Saturday,
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.440]   this young lady answers the phone.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.560]   And I just say, hey, my cat is stuck in a tree.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.440]   Do you guys actually do that, or is that just
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.840]   on TV in small towns where the fire department has
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.800]   nothing else going on?
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.400]   Is that like something you do?
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.980]   And she said, oh, yeah, we'll do that.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.860]   And I said, OK, well, how can I schedule that?
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.160]   Because I got a cat in a tree right now.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.480]   And she says, well, you need to call 911 and just tell them.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.200]   And I was like, this feels like a violation, but OK.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.640]   And so I hang up, call 911, and it's like, Dallas Fire,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.520]   what's your emergency?
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.800]   And I'm like, no emergency.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.520]   Just want to let you know, my name's Adam.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.480]   Hope you're doing well.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.440]   I called this other number, and they told me to call you
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.000]   because I got a cat stuck in the tree.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.440]   And I heard that if the fire guys aren't doing anything,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.240]   they'll come get my cat out of the tree.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.880]   And they said, sure, we'll do that.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.680]   Where do you live?
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.600]   Gave them the address.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.840]   Come.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.920]   And I'm like, problem solved.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.880]   Walk into the kitchen.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.400]   I'm all proud.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.960]   Jackie, I called the fire department.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.600]   They're coming.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.680]   And she's like, I'm having nothing to do with this, OK?
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.360]   This is all you.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.240]   I'm staying inside.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.320]   So I go outside, and I'm anxiously
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.440]   waiting for the fire department to show up.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.480]   And then literally, like seven minutes later,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.000]   this truck comes rolling down.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.320]   And then it stops right in front of my house.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   And then it turns the lights on.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.000]   It's dark outside now, or it's like right at dusk.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.720]   My entire neighborhood is now lit up in lights.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.280]   And that was the first moment when
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.160]   I started to realize, oh, no, I should not have done this,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.640]   OK?
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.960]   Because now the neighbors are starting
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.560]   to look out the window, and people
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.680]   are starting to come out on their porch.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.400]   And they're like, who had a heart attack?
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.040]   What's going on?
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.800]   And I'm just sitting there going, no, it's just me, my cat.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.960]   And so then three of the manliest men
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.440]   I have ever seen in my life--
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.920]   you guys know those firemen calendars?
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.680]   I promise you, it was May, June, and July on this fire truck
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.520]   that get down.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.840]   And it's in that moment I am just like,
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.960]   what is going on in my life right now?
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.760]   In the recovery world, we call that rock bottom.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.360]   I had hit rock bottom right there.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.800]   And I just realized, I'm like, yeah, my cat's over here.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.320]   And so I walk him to the backyard.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.360]   And Mr. May brings the ladder up.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.880]   And then June climbs up it.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.840]   And I start to try to man up a little bit in that.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.080]   And I just think, oh, I'm going to say something cool.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.520]   And I'm like, if you've got a gun, you can shoot him down.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.440]   And they looked at me like, you are an idiot, OK?
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.880]   And so they grabbed my cat.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.760]   They grabbed Pedro.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   And they hand him to me.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.360]   And I take him inside.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.760]   And I look at my wife.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.160]   And I'm like, it's all done.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.920]   I got him.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.720]   And she was just like, I can't believe you did that.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.220]   And I just said, I know I've kind of lost the will to live,
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.840]   I think, now.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.040]   And as the time went by, just a few minutes go by,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.680]   and now they're leaving.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.840]   I was overwhelmed with just this feeling of humiliation
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.000]   and embarrassment.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.840]   It was pretty-- it was prevalent.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.000]   It was very real.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.520]   And so I start with that tonight,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.280]   because that's what we're going to talk about as we're going on
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.240]   in this series called Mood, is we're
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.520]   taking a biblical look at different human emotions.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.980]   And so the human emotion that we're
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.960]   going to talk about tonight is shame, shame and embarrassment.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.760]   And when I say shame, here's what I mean.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.080]   Shame is that feeling that we have,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.400]   this deep feeling of humiliation we have after certain choices
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.560]   that we make.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.880]   Shame is this thing in our life where
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   we feel this desire to hide or conceal
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.240]   different parts of our life.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.400]   That's what shame is.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.760]   And so shame is prevalent in every single one of our lives.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.240]   And that's why I think tonight's message is so important,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.280]   because what I know is probably true about every single person
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.080]   in this room tonight is this, is that you struggle with shame.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.080]   It is a universal emotion.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.400]   Every single one of us feels shame at certain points
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.600]   throughout the day or we have at certain points in our life.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.800]   It is like a disease that has infected humanity.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.960]   All of us have felt it.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.840]   Some of us are in here tonight, and this is exactly
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.680]   what we're feeling.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.440]   We're feeling this humiliation for certain choices
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.840]   that we've made, and we have this deep desire
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.040]   to try to conceal or hide certain aspects of our life.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.480]   But what makes shame so interesting and so dangerous
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.400]   is unlike other moods or other emotions
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.800]   that you and I experience, shame is absolutely intolerable.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.920]   If you think about it, the other moods or emotions
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.960]   that we go through, you can feel them for a long period of time.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.160]   You can feel joy for a long period of time.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160]   You can feel happy for a long period of time.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.440]   You can feel content for a long period of time.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.560]   You can feel mad or angry for a long period of time.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.840]   You can feel depressed or sad or hopeless
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   for a long period of time.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.200]   But shame, this feeling of humiliation,
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.880]   this feeling that I want to hide or conceal,
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.320]   is unlike any of those other emotions.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.240]   Shame is intolerable in our life,
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.520]   and it always, always, always leads us to action.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.600]   And oftentimes, as we're going to see tonight,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.720]   that action, what we choose to do, where we choose to run,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.640]   it doesn't help at all.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.360]   Shame is a big deal for every single one of us,
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.760]   and you have got to learn how to deal with shame,
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.920]   because if you don't learn how to deal with it,
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.360]   it will take you out.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.440]   It will completely take you out.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.460]   In the extreme examples, it will lead to suicide.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.060]   You will just become so humiliated with your life
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.220]   and so down about your life, and you will lose all hope
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.800]   that anything in the future could ever be better.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.320]   And so in an extreme example, if shame,
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.840]   if you don't learn how to deal with it,
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.060]   it will lead to you just ending your life.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.160]   It'll end in suicide.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.080]   But more commonly, where it probably ends for a lot of us
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.640]   is this, is just this gnawing, nagging, deep-seated
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.640]   insecurity and low-level depression that just hangs with us.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.920]   And it just seems to be this thing,
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.360]   this mood that we cannot shake.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.640]   Shame impacts every single one of us,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.480]   and if we don't learn how to deal with it,
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.800]   it is going to take us out.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.960]   And so what we're gonna do tonight
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.000]   is we're gonna open up God's Word,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.760]   and we're gonna be in this little story in Luke 8,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.480]   in the gospel of Luke, and it's actually kind of a story
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.400]   within a story, and so here's a little bit of the context.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.100]   Jesus has been doing some public ministry.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.300]   There are a lot of crowds around Him,
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.400]   and He is walking through this town,
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.980]   and this family comes up to Him,
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.440]   and they tell Him about their daughter who is sick,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.340]   this family member who is so sick
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.700]   that she's on the verge of dying.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.640]   And so Jesus, full of compassion,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.120]   wants to go and help this family
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.080]   and try to heal this young woman, to heal this young girl.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.440]   Well, as Jesus and the crowds are moving towards this house,
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.880]   a woman comes and interrupts Jesus.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.120]   And it's in these few verses in this interruption
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.920]   as Jesus is on His way to go heal this young girl
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.160]   where we're gonna see a story
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.360]   that really parallels our life a lot when it comes to shame.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.540]   And so that's what we're gonna look at today.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.120]   So if you got your Bibles, let's open up to Luke 8.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.520]   We're gonna be in verses 42 through 48.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.480]   And so here we go.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.720]   Luke 8, verses 42.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.540]   "As Jesus was on His way, the crowds almost crushed Him.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.740]   And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.720]   for 12 years."
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.480]   For 12 years, this is what I love about God's Word,
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.700]   is that it doesn't hide anything.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.800]   It talks about real adult human things.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.680]   And so this poor woman was subject to vaginal hemorrhaging
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.720]   for over 12 years, for 12 years.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.400]   So Jesus is on His way and this woman who had been bleeding
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.120]   for 12 years comes up to Him and this is what happens.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.120]   So she had been subject to bleeding for 12 years,
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.580]   but no one could heal her.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.560]   This was a plague that she had been carrying around,
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.880]   this thorn in her side that she had been carrying around.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.800]   In verse 44, "She came up behind Jesus
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.760]   and touched the edge of His cloak.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.440]   And immediately her bleeding stopped."
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.600]   Then verse 45, "Who touched me?"
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.440]   Jesus asked.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.280]   Let's just pause here for a second.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   So you can kind of get this scene.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.880]   There's these crowds, they're crushing Jesus
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.160]   and He's moving on and they wanna see this drama
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.400]   that's gonna happen as He goes
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.100]   and is gonna heal this young girl.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.800]   And there in the midst of all of that,
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.220]   this woman sneaks up behind Him,
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.980]   touches the edge of His cloak and then just disappears.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.360]   And Jesus is kind of looking around going, "Who touched me?"
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.640]   And you can think about this woman
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.560]   and why it was that would cause her,
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.240]   what it was in her life that would cause her
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.760]   to want to sneak up behind Jesus.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.360]   And it's pretty clear and it's easy to understand
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.600]   why she would do that because the thing
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.560]   that had been ailing her or the ailment that she had
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.240]   was incredibly embarrassing.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.580]   I mean, for 12 years to have that bleeding,
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.680]   and you can just imagine all the different layers
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.820]   that were there adding to the complications
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.760]   that culturally, because she was having this bleeding
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.200]   that would not stop for 12 years,
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.840]   culturally, she was an outcast.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.600]   She was an outcast and she was considered unclean.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.960]   She was this recluse, she was isolated
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.880]   because of this problem that was going on with her own body.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.200]   And so because she was an outcast culturally,
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.080]   that means spiritually, she could not worship God.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.800]   She was an outcast spiritually.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.480]   And then you just think about the embarrassment physically
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.880]   and how uncomfortable that must have been physically
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.880]   in the first century when we don't have
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.520]   the modern medicine that we have today
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.920]   or even the hygiene products that we have today.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.900]   This was a woman who was dealing with a significant issue
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.680]   and she was feeling this inadequacy in her life.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.720]   She was feeling this inadequacy.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.140]   It was something that was embarrassing,
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.860]   something that she wanted to conceal or hide,
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.680]   something that was probably humiliating her.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.020]   But mixed with that inadequacy,
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.000]   there was also probably some pride.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.080]   There was probably some pride in all of that.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.080]   And where we grab that out of the text is this,
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.520]   is that she was one of the only people
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.960]   that we see recorded in the gospels
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.080]   that wanted healing from Jesus
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.560]   that snuck up behind him to get that healing.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.260]   If you read through the rest of the gospels,
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.120]   what you'll see is that when somebody was physically,
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.880]   had something going on and they came to Jesus
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.780]   and wanted healing, they were very public about it.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.760]   I mean, they would come up and be like,
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.340]   "Jesus, see, I'm blind," or "I'm lame right now,"
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.580]   or they would be laying out in a spot in public
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.000]   where all of those who had the physical ailments were.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.480]   And so Jesus would show up
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.880]   and it was very, very public for so many people.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.840]   This is probably, or what I seem to think,
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.080]   is the only recording of somebody who needed healing
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.480]   that snuck up behind Jesus
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.200]   and did not wanna make it public.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.280]   So she had this inadequacy in her life,
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.880]   this failure in her life,
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.360]   this thing that was embarrassing to her,
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.160]   but she also had her reputation.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.200]   She had some pride that she didn't want everybody to know.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.960]   And so she snuck up behind him to try to touch his cloak.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.200]   And the first point or observation
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.360]   I wanna make out of the passage
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.840]   and where our lives kind of parallel
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.120]   the life of this woman is this,
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.320]   is that really is the formula for shame.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.060]   The formula for shame, if there is one, is this,
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.200]   it's our inadequacy and our pride.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.880]   When we understand that we're inadequate,
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.120]   but we also have some pride, we have some reputation,
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.880]   we're not okay with that inadequacy,
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.480]   when those two things are together,
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.220]   that's when we start to feel humiliated.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.920]   That's when we start to wanna conceal or hide.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.160]   And so let me illustrate it this way,
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.780]   because I think what a lot of us do
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.960]   when we look at our own lives
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.240]   is we end up kind of bifurcating our lives.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.200]   We split our lives into two.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.240]   We wouldn't really admit that we do this,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.040]   but really this is what happens,
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.180]   is that we think that there's two,
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.440]   you think there's two of you and I think there's two of me.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.600]   There's the ideal you and then there's the bad you.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.520]   And the ideal you is the you that really follows this.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.880]   Let's just fill in the blank.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.000]   I should fill in the blank.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.920]   You've got your answers, I've got my answers,
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.400]   but the way you answer that and the way I answer that,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.880]   that's what determines the ideal you.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.320]   So I should always be in control of my emotions.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   I should always wanna feel like spending time with Jesus.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.900]   I should always share the gospel every chance that I get.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.040]   I should not feel anxious.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.100]   I should be married right now.
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.400]   I should be in a better job right now.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.000]   I should be in a better financial position right now.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.840]   Whatever it is, when you have all of those things lined up,
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   you are setting these expectations on your own life,
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.000]   saying you should do something.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.520]   And when you do it,
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.320]   achieve those little goals that you set out.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.160]   When you do, behave in the way that you think you should.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.880]   That's the ideal you.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.560]   That's the you you like 'cause you're behaving.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.060]   That's the you you think everybody else likes
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.960]   because you're performing.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.520]   That's the you you think God really loves,
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.380]   the you that is easy for God to love.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.060]   So we have this ideal
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.680]   that every single one of us wants to achieve.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.580]   But we also know based on our experience
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.020]   that that's not always happens.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.520]   We don't always meet up with our own expectations.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.760]   And so we have some failure,
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.880]   some inadequacy that comes into our life.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.960]   We cannot keep up with our own standards
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.400]   that we set in our own life.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.360]   And so inevitably,
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.440]   even though you want to always stay in control
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.280]   of your emotions,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.320]   even though you want to never feel anxiety,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.240]   even though you never wanna get angry again,
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.360]   the fact of the matter is this, you do get angry.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.300]   You do feel anxious.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.100]   You are ashamed of your family.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.640]   You are ashamed of your past.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.180]   You do not do everything that you wish you would do.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.540]   So there is inadequacy.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.980]   And when there's inadequacy,
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.300]   then we think we are the bad version of us.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.800]   And this bad version of us down here, this is toxic.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.340]   We don't like it.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.020]   We don't think other people like it.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.020]   We don't think God likes it.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.780]   And so we wallow.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.620]   And there's two us.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.060]   We wish we could be some way, we're inadequate.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.160]   And so we come down here and there is the bad us.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.740]   When we're down here in this toxic part of our life,
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.800]   this is where shame pops in.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.280]   This is where we start to feel humiliated.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.000]   This is where we want to conceal or to hide everything.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.960]   I remember the day in my life specifically,
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.120]   I remember the night when shame
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.960]   became very, very real for me.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.660]   It was probably in my early 20s.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.720]   I was living in Atlanta at the time and I was an accountant.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.680]   I was an auditor and I had a client in Huntsville, Alabama.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.240]   I'd gone to this client completely on my own.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.000]   My firm had sent me out there on my own
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.840]   and showed up on a Sunday night.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.600]   And I was there all the way through Thursday night.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.000]   I was going to be driving back home on a Friday after work.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.460]   And I remember it was really a pretty great week
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.020]   until it got to Thursday night.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.600]   It was a great week because I was by myself
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.620]   and being a natural introvert,
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.900]   I liked having time to be by myself in the hotel and read.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.120]   And I was reading a great book
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.120]   and I felt like I was growing
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.560]   in my relationship with God that week.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.280]   I was reading a book about character
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.200]   and how you can grow to be a person of character.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.080]   And I remember Thursday night,
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.400]   I read a chapter that said,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.920]   "Sometimes in order to go forward, you have to go back."
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.760]   And I remember reading that sentence
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.280]   and hearing that author talk about,
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.200]   "Hey, you've got things in your life that you've done.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.600]   You've got things that you've done to other people.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.660]   You've got certain actions
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.940]   that you need to confess and own up to.
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.680]   And this part of you sometimes to be able to progress
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.640]   and to become a person of character,
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.020]   you've got to go back and deal with all of that
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.240]   before you can move forward in maturity and character."
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.580]   And I'll never forget how hopeless I felt that night.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.800]   Because my story is this,
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.200]   my story is when I was three years old,
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.100]   I was first exposed to pornography.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.800]   And so from age three until about age 21,
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.160]   pornography was a regular part of my life.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.280]   I look back on my childhood
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.880]   and there are certainly a lot of great moments.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.000]   I had a loving family and had a great family, great parents,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.360]   but I look back on my childhood
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.120]   and there is also a tremendous amount of embarrassment.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.960]   Being exposed to pornography at that young,
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.680]   that meant in those years when I was making decisions
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.960]   and I was involved in certain activities
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.580]   that were just embarrassing.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.480]   And I felt like there was this part of my life
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.000]   that the thought of going back and revisiting that,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.520]   the thought of going back in order to go forward,
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.560]   the thought of going back and maybe telling somebody else
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.580]   about those things was horrifying.
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.720]   And I remember there was just in that moment,
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.360]   I just said, "I'm gonna conceal this.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.120]   I don't wanna talk to anybody about this.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.680]   If that's what it takes to go forward,
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.160]   I'm fine not going forward."
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.360]   And so I'll never forget that night.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.320]   I closed that chapter, I closed that book,
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.340]   I put it in my bag and I just said,
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.080]   "I wanna do anything I can
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.360]   to not think about my past right now."
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.640]   So I turned on the television
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.780]   and I slept that night with the lights on
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.840]   and I made sure for the next couple of weeks
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.360]   that I never was alone or quiet.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.480]   I always wanted noise
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.040]   'cause I did not wanna go back there.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.240]   I was feeling humiliated to think
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.360]   that I was gonna have to go back and somehow deal with this.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.400]   I liked this Adam, I didn't like this Adam.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.980]   I thought God liked this Adam,
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.000]   I didn't think God liked this Adam
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.360]   and I didn't wanna go back.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.080]   Shame causes us to hide,
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.200]   it causes us to run
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.420]   and the reason that it's there
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.400]   is because we all feel this deep-seated inadequacy.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.880]   We all know we've done things.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.220]   We all know that we fall short of our own standard in life
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.600]   and that's the formula.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.340]   That's the formula often is our inadequacy
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.780]   mixed with our pride
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.240]   and so that's the reason for our shame
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   but let's keep going 'cause the story gets much better.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.520]   So verse 45, Jesus said, "Who touched me?"
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.560]   When they all denied it, Peter said,
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.400]   "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.200]   So you can imagine the scene, Jesus,
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.800]   he felt that somebody had touched him
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.480]   and he starts going around going, "Who was it?
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.560]   "Was it you, was it you, was it you, was it you?"
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   And everybody denied it
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.240]   and then Peter finally steps up and just says,
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.640]   "Listen, there's a lot of people around
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.180]   "so maybe it was just somebody touched you by accident
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.120]   "or something like that."
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.700]   And Jesus said, "Someone touched me.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.600]   "I know that power has gone out from me."
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.720]   And so let me just pause here
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.160]   and let's just have another observation
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.920]   and see where our lives kind of run parallel
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.800]   to this woman's life.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.000]   But first, let me say this,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.720]   Jesus knew exactly what he was doing.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.760]   Jesus here wondering who touched him,
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.740]   it's not like Jesus was a character
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.080]   or a person in a video game
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.480]   that when he got hit and some power went down
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.500]   and he's just sitting around going,
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.800]   "All right, I saw my power levels go down, who hit me?"
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.240]   You know, he knew exactly what was going on.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.540]   The point of this interaction
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.240]   and the reason why Luke was recording these details
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.400]   is because what was going on is that woman was gone.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.080]   She had run, she wasn't there.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.520]   And so the second observation that I wanna make is this,
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.360]   is that the reason for our shame is inadequacy and pride,
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.760]   but our response to shame,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.000]   our response to shame is often the exact same
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.240]   as this woman's.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.460]   Our response to shame is to run.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.640]   It's to run.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.520]   And so when we come over here and we have this ideal you
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.840]   and you're inadequate, and then there's this bad you,
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.960]   you don't wanna hang down here.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.800]   And so what do you do?
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.620]   You run.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.340]   You run.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.560]   And you run to anything that you think
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.220]   is gonna get you back to the ideal you.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.740]   And so some of you, what you do
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.760]   is you run to religious things.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.600]   And let's just be honest,
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.780]   there's probably some of you in the room here tonight.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.320]   And the reason you're here tonight
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.960]   is because you're trying to make up for something
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.080]   you did this weekend.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.280]   And so you'll run to religious things,
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.160]   you'll run to church,
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.140]   you'll run to these religious activities
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:06.980]   where you're just going,
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.160]   all right, I'm gonna read my Bible every day,
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.560]   or I'm gonna serve every day,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.400]   or I'm gonna give,
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.120]   or I'm gonna try to be others focused.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.400]   And so you'll run over there,
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.120]   or you'll start to feel bad about yourself and inadequate.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.480]   And so you're gonna run to the gym,
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.360]   you're gonna run to work,
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.200]   you're gonna run to Netflix,
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.320]   you're gonna run to podcasts,
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.640]   you're gonna run to anything that will get your mind
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.960]   off of thinking about your own inadequacy.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.760]   And so when we start to feel the shame,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.580]   we start to run, there's an activity,
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.700]   because it's intolerable,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.540]   we always want to do something,
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.980]   and so we'll run towards these other activities,
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.300]   or we'll run away from certain activities
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.620]   and certain people.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.560]   We'll run from God.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.480]   We'll run from our friends.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.180]   When do you wanna not answer the text
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.640]   from somebody in your community group
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.500]   on how are you doing?
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.820]   You wanna answer it about two or three hours
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.500]   after you've just faced your own inadequacy again,
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.160]   and you understand,
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.000]   and you're feeling all of this shame.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.160]   What we start to realize with this, with shame, guys,
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.240]   is we start to realize this,
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.200]   is that this shame that we feel down there,
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.160]   it is really a gateway mood,
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.120]   it's a gateway emotion to other things.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.280]   Oftentimes, because we feel the shame,
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.040]   this is where we bring about other destructive habits
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:25.860]   into our life.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.000]   This is why we run to anger.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.760]   This is why we run to addictions.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.080]   This is why we're so anxious.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.160]   It's not because we struggle with anxiety,
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.460]   it's because we struggle with shame.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.780]   Or not because we struggle with drugs and alcohol,
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.980]   it's because we struggle with shame.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.600]   We're trying to hide something.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.660]   We're trying to get this feeling away
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:45.160]   from anything and everything except from Jesus.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.480]   It just doesn't work.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.320]   It just doesn't work.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.500]   And so for my story,
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.040]   for my story, the gateway for me,
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.060]   when I was feeling shame,
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.260]   the gateway for me was anger.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.100]   That's where I would go.
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.120]   I would go with anger.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.920]   And so I remember very clearly,
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.420]   again, one of the times where this became so clear,
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.140]   that when I was feeling shame,
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.480]   I would act out in anger,
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.040]   and I thought I had an anger problem.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.560]   And to my great shame right now,
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.680]   I need to share with you another story about a cat.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.980]   And I now, I'm gonna go down as the guy
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.840]   that came to the porch and shared two stories about cats.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.960]   Okay, so that's okay.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.520]   So anyway, it's the same cat, Pedro.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.880]   I am in my apartment.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.440]   Again, we don't have kids.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.640]   And for some reason, the memory that I have
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.980]   is I remember I was doing a puzzle.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.400]   I think it was over Christmas.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.320]   So it just makes the story even better, right?
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.720]   And I'm doing a puzzle.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.560]   And I remember the cat kept getting up on the table
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.800]   and interrupting the puzzle
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.160]   and like moving all the pieces away.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.600]   And I'm getting frustrated and I keep pushing the cat down.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.400]   He jumps off, I push the cat down.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.520]   He jumps on, I push the cat down.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.300]   And I get so frustrated with him.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.440]   Every time he jumps up there,
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.160]   I'm getting more and more frustrated.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.320]   But then I also know that I'm starting to get frustrated
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.720]   that I'm getting frustrated.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.880]   And I start to think I shouldn't be getting frustrated
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.240]   for a cat interrupting my puzzle right now.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.440]   And so I finally, he jumps up there and I push him down
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.320]   and he kind of scurries on the table
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.740]   and all these pieces go flying.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.800]   And I am so mad and so frustrated right now
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   that I just pick up the closest thing I can find,
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.280]   which is a bag of pretzels.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.400]   And I chase him around the apartment
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.020]   and I throw the bag of pretzels at the cat,
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.920]   which does absolutely nothing to the cat.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.520]   And all it does is pretzels and salt go flying everywhere,
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.120]   all over the apartment and all over the wood floors.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   And now there are just little granular pieces of salt
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.920]   and pretzel everywhere.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.120]   And I'm sitting there and I'm just going,
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.740]   what is going on?
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.800]   And I remember I went to go talk to my friend
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.880]   and I was trying to process this with my friend.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.660]   And I was just like, man, here's what happened.
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.080]   I tell you, man, I got an anger problem.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.040]   I think I've got an anger problem.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:55.960]   He said, well, tell me about it.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.720]   And I'm going, this and this,
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.120]   and I threw the pretzels and salt went everywhere.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.160]   And he's like, yeah, maybe an anger problem,
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.400]   but why were you angry?
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.560]   I said, why was I angry?
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.360]   Well, here's exactly why I was angry.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.160]   I was angry because I was so frustrated
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.920]   at how flustered I was getting.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.040]   I was angry because I just realized,
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.900]   Adam, you shouldn't be mad about this.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.840]   Adam, you shouldn't be freaking out about this.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.620]   Adam, you should be able to stay in control
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.460]   of your emotions.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.840]   You should be calm.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.800]   I mean, you've been following Jesus for almost 10 years now.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.680]   Shouldn't you grow up beyond this silly little behavior
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.960]   where a little thing like this is frustrating you?
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.920]   And I'm just listing out all of these should,
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.660]   should, should, should, should.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.840]   And he's just going, listen, man,
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.400]   I just wanna help you and connect these dots here.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.480]   Your anger, your anger is you're trying to run.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.360]   It's rooted in your shame.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.100]   That's where that anger comes from.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   And so shame causes us to run towards things.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.560]   And what we all know in here,
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.160]   and every single one of us would admit this,
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.160]   is whatever it is that you do that you run
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.840]   to try to get back to the ideal you,
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.780]   what you know is this, it doesn't work.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.560]   It doesn't work.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:18.200]   And that's why you keep going back over and over
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.960]   and over and over again.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.420]   And that's why this cycle continues in our life
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.920]   is because our strategies for dealing with shame
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.460]   that don't involve Jesus do not work.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.120]   Because no matter where you run,
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.480]   no matter where you try to hide, you're always there.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.900]   And our strategies don't help us at all.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.100]   So the reason for our shame is this inadequacy
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.560]   and this pride, and our response to shame
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.560]   is typically to run, but there's a remedy.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.460]   There's a remedy that this woman encountered,
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.800]   and there's a remedy for all of us that we can encounter.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.640]   And so let's look at this.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.600]   Let's look how this story wraps up here.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.520]   Jesus said, "Someone touched me.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.760]   "I know that power has gone out for me," in verse 46.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.960]   Here's what he says in verse 47.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.480]   "Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed,
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.240]   "came trembling and fell at his feet.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.800]   "In the presence of all the people,
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.680]   "she told why she had touched him
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.620]   "and how she had been instantly healed.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.320]   "And then he said to her daughter,
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.880]   "Your faith has healed you.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.200]   "Go in peace."
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.640]   I don't know if we can recreate the tension and the emotion
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.240]   and the relief and the embarrassment and the anxiety
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.560]   and all of that that that woman probably was feeling,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.660]   but all I know is this, is it seems like
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.820]   she was ready to quit hiding.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.680]   She was ready to quit hiding,
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.000]   and when Jesus kept calling out
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.620]   and she knew that the Lord was calling her,
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.640]   and that's why he was saying, "I know power went out."
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.840]   He wanted to draw this woman out,
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.880]   and she just finally said, "I'm done running.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.200]   "I'm done trying to hide."
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.160]   And she fell at his feet.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:04.200]   And in front of everyone, that whole crowd that was there,
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.440]   she admitted, "Here's why I touched your cloak.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.000]   "Here's what's going on in my life."
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.340]   So she was incredibly vulnerable,
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.840]   and she laid it at the feet of Jesus.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.240]   And what she wanted when she went to go find
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.780]   and sneak up to Jesus, what she wanted was healing.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.060]   And she got healing,
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:24.340]   but she got something way more than that too,
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:29.100]   is that she got a relationship, a relationship with God.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.540]   She got grace.
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.900]   She was now no longer this recluse.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.160]   She was now a daughter of the king.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.380]   She came looking for healing,
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.780]   and what she got was not just that,
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.140]   but she got a restored relationship with God.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.720]   She was no longer a social outcast.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.580]   And so this third observation that we'll make
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.180]   just as we wrap up tonight is this,
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.020]   is that the remedy for our shame
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.200]   is to come to terms with reality.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.820]   This woman just came to terms with reality.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.020]   I can't hide anymore.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.500]   I gotta go just bring it to Jesus.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.380]   She came to terms with reality.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.100]   And so the remedy for my shame and for your shame
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.560]   is not just to keep running.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.780]   Because if we keep running,
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.500]   we're just gonna stay on this cycle,
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.820]   and it's just gonna keep going and going and going.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.020]   And so I have some bad news for you.
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.800]   The bad news is this is true.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.860]   This is true about you.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.300]   There are moments in your life
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.400]   where you can be the ideal you.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.420]   There's moments in your life
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.640]   where whatever it is that you think you should do,
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.480]   you can do it.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.420]   You can achieve that.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.020]   You can act a certain way
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.140]   for a certain period of time in your own strength.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.540]   But what else is true about you
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.960]   is that you are wholly inadequate
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.960]   to keep it up for a long period of time.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.060]   And what's also equally true about you
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:43.060]   is there's a lot of bad in every single one of us.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.700]   And the bad news is this,
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.400]   is that there is more bad in us,
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.980]   there is more inadequacy in us
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.060]   than there is ideal in us.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.760]   But the good news is this,
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.340]   is that God is not surprised by any of that.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.860]   And what's even better,
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.640]   even better news is He loves you anyway.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.980]   That's what's called the gospel.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.220]   That God saw here that we all fall short
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.240]   of the glory of God,
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.100]   that the wages of sin is death.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.660]   He knows that this is who we are,
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:17.940]   and that not only do we feel bad about ourselves in this,
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.560]   but this fractures our relationship
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.700]   with the God of the universe.
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.160]   And the wages of that sin is death,
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.440]   but the free gift of God is eternal life
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.960]   through Christ Jesus.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.400]   And so not only does this lead us on a cycle
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.360]   where we just feel this shame and this humiliation,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.160]   this separates us from God.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.420]   And God didn't wanna leave us there.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:43.000]   And so He sent Jesus to die on the cross on our behalf.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.260]   That's the good news.
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:47.120]   And so the reality though for us,
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.380]   the reality that we need to embrace is this,
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.440]   is that you and I,
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:54.840]   we need the gospel every single day of our life.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.560]   You don't just need it one time
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.560]   to receive forgiveness for your sins,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.980]   and then you don't need the gospel anymore.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:05.080]   You need the gospel every single day of your life,
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.520]   because every day you are faced with your own inadequacy.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.760]   You cannot be the person that you wanna be
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.000]   apart from Jesus.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.560]   And I think for so many of us,
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.440]   part of the shame that we feel
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.200]   is that we feel ashamed that we need the gospel every day.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.680]   We're just tired that we have to keep,
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.600]   that we keep failing
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.200]   and that we can't seem to string together a good season.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.800]   And what really is going on is our pride is so high
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.440]   that we just are ashamed
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.120]   that we need the gospel every day,
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.020]   that we're a sinner in need of a savior,
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.320]   not one time for a lifetime.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.160]   And may we never be ashamed of the gospel.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.120]   May we be like Paul.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.480]   Look at what he says here in Romans 1, verse 16.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.240]   He says, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel,
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.640]   "because it is the power of God
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.700]   "that brings salvation to everyone who believes,
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.740]   "first to the Jew and then to the Gentile.
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:59.960]   "For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed,
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.840]   "a righteousness that is by faith from first to last.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.500]   "And just as it is written,
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.720]   "the righteous will live by faith."
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.280]   What Paul is saying there is,
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.320]   listen, I'm not ashamed of the gospel.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.720]   I need the gospel every single day.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.560]   You know why?
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.960]   Because my righteousness, my relationship with God
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.640]   is not based on my own activities.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.640]   If it were based on my own activities, I'm sunk.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.720]   I don't need a second chance.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.300]   I've already blown the second chance.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.960]   I need a savior.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.920]   And I need that savior every single day.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.960]   And I just wanna remind us tonight of this,
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.800]   is that when you say you're a Christian,
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.360]   when you claim to be a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.560]   that is a self-deprecating statement.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.680]   You know what you're telling the world
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.860]   when you say I follow Jesus?
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.600]   You're saying I'm not good enough.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.040]   I can't save myself.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.160]   I can't string together enough good days.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.840]   Left to myself, I'm going to hell.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.960]   And I don't need a second chance.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.600]   What I need is I need a savior,
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.400]   and that savior is Jesus Christ.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.160]   And so I love that you get to hear that
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.120]   if this is your first time here at The Porch,
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.960]   'cause I'd imagine you come into a room like this
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.920]   and you see all these beautiful people in here
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.700]   raising their hands and they're singing,
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.640]   and you're maybe feeling shame and just going,
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.360]   all these people must be so good.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.860]   They must be so good that they can sing and they smile
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.320]   and they look like they're in a good mood.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.380]   And I just wanna let you know,
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.900]   if that's you and it's your first time,
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.800]   this room is not full of good people.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.280]   This room is full of very bad people.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.400]   In fact, let's just take a moment.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.480]   Make sure your wallet is still there, ladies.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.520]   Make sure your purse is still around, okay?
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.140]   'Cause there are bad people in here.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.400]   This is not a museum of awesome.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.460]   This is a hospital full of sick people
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.560]   who have found the healer in Jesus Christ, amen?
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.400]   Amen.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.720]   The only way, the only way to get off this shame cycle
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.600]   is you've gotta run somewhere else.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.360]   The only way is that you've gotta run to Jesus.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.360]   That's how you get off the shame cycle.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.040]   So the source, the reason for our shame
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.760]   is inadequacy and pride,
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.100]   'cause we know that we cannot be who we wanna be,
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.560]   and yet we're prideful and we're embarrassed about that.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.300]   And so that's why we feel this need
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.160]   and this humiliation to conceal and hide.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.780]   And we end up running because shame is intolerable.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.300]   We run to something.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.540]   We run to things or we run from people or from God.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.040]   And those solutions never work.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.020]   The only remedy is to come to terms with reality
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.660]   and that we need the gospel every single day.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.980]   And so I'll close with this one last story
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.420]   when the end of the shame cycle
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.300]   became very clear in my life.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.300]   And so I had that night in Huntsville, Alabama.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.380]   I read that book and I was like,
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.900]   I just want to forget all of my past.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.020]   I don't wanna go back and talk about anything.
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.140]   And I drove back to Atlanta and went a few days
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.680]   of just trying to isolate and trying to ignore.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.780]   And it just, it was overwhelming.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.920]   The shame was overwhelming.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.460]   And I finally just said, I've got to tell somebody.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.580]   So I got a couple of friends together
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.420]   and I just said, listen, we've been friends for a while.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.460]   You know a lot about me, but you don't know everything.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.320]   And I'm feeling overwhelmed with a sense of humiliation.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.860]   And I just, I don't know how you're gonna react to this.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.980]   I'm afraid of how you're gonna react to this,
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.580]   but I'm just gonna tell you everything.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.780]   And so here's what happened when I was three.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.800]   And then here's what happened in my elementary school years.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.340]   And then here's what middle school was like.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.620]   And here's what high school was like.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.880]   And here's what college was like
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.800]   before I came to know Jesus.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.500]   And I did this and then I thought that.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.780]   And then I used to believe this.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.060]   And then there was this experience.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.220]   And I just laid it all out there.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.180]   And it was so terrifying
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.780]   'cause I had no clue what they were gonna do.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.640]   I didn't know if somebody would love me anyway.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.660]   So I laid it all out there and I was just amazed
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.860]   at the amount of grace and mercy that was shown to me
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.940]   as I shared all of those things.
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.860]   And my friends looked at me and they said, me too.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.880]   Yeah, maybe it looks a little bit different, Adam.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.140]   Maybe it's not the exact same facts and circumstances,
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.080]   but let me tell you all the things that I'm embarrassed about.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.540]   Let me tell you all the things that I am humiliated by.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.700]   We just in that moment just got into this habit
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.160]   of being able to share these things
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.140]   that normally would plague us and be this cycle of shame
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.580]   and try to drive us to run from God
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.120]   or run to some religious activity
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.220]   to try to make ourselves feel better.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.620]   And we just got in this habit of trying
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.960]   to just confess these things to one another.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.380]   And so now for the past 10 or 15 years,
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.820]   that's how I deal with shame.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:41.220]   That's the remedy is that you run to Jesus
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.860]   and you often by running to Jesus,
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.500]   you run to Jesus's people.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:48.220]   And when you run to Jesus and you run to Jesus's people
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.400]   and you just start to go, listen,
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.540]   this is what I'm afraid of.
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.380]   This is what I think you're gonna leave me over.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.420]   What you realize is that Proverbs 28 is true,
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.700]   that whoever conceals their sins does not prosper,
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:05.920]   but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.600]   And so my challenge for all of us here tonight is this,
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.440]   it's just really simple,
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.600]   it's just to run to Jesus, get off that cycle.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.480]   We all do it, we've all got the cycle,
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.400]   we've all got inadequacy in our life,
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.280]   we've all got these things that are humiliating
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.120]   that we wanna hide,
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.200]   we've got stories that we don't wanna share.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.860]   And so my challenge to you is to get off the cycle
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.240]   and to run to the cross,
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.340]   and to first and foremost,
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.660]   recognize and realize that God loves you anyway.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.980]   There's intimacy there, He's not afraid of that,
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.980]   He knows all of those things, you've been found out already.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:42.340]   And by running to Jesus, you can then run to His people
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.380]   and you can tell someone.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.540]   So if that's you here tonight and you walked in
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.200]   and you're just plagued by this shame
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.180]   and you know that it's this gateway mood
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.220]   or this gateway emotion
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.500]   and there's all kinds of other destructive behaviors
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.540]   in your life tonight,
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.740]   I'm telling you, you can get off that cycle,
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.080]   you can stop it tonight.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.780]   The people that brought you here tonight,
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.060]   you can talk to them,
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.580]   the group of us down here at the end,
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.600]   we'd love to talk to you or to point you
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.600]   to other people that can help,
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.160]   there's a way off that cycle.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.460]   So we're all inadequate, we all struggle with pride,
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.380]   we all wanna run somewhere and the remedy is found
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.860]   when we embrace this reality
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.700]   that we are sinners in need of a Savior
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.260]   and that Savior is Jesus and we run to Him, amen?
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.120]   Amen, let's pray.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:34.740]   Lord, we thank you for the cross.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.900]   We thank you that we can share embarrassing stories
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.900]   and inadequacies in our own life with one another
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:49.340]   and we're just grateful we can do that, God.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.340]   We're grateful that we can confess these things to you
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.740]   and that you love us anyway.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:58.700]   We're grateful, Lord, that our deepest fears of rejection
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.380]   are just cast aside when we come to the foot of the cross.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.700]   We're grateful, Lord, stories like of this woman
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.220]   that our lives parallel that we can identify with
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.660]   and I pray that all of us here tonight
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.920]   will experience that same grace and mercy
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.060]   that that woman experienced
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.940]   when she fell at your feet, Jesus.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.700]   And so, Lord, we just thank you for the gospel
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.380]   that our relationship with you is not founded on what we do
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.100]   but on what you did.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:31.780]   And so, God, we worship you not because we're good.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:36.700]   We worship you because you're good and you forgive
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.720]   and you are full of grace and mercy.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.420]   And so, Lord, my friends tonight that are just trembling,
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.460]   that are afraid to tell somebody,
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.300]   I pray that you'll give them courage, Lord.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.380]   That they'll talk to friends,
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.580]   that they'll talk to other followers of you.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.900]   And they'll be able to experience the freedom
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.380]   that comes from running to the cross.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.860]   And we pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:08.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
