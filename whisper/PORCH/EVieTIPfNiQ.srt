1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 - James is made up of 108 verses.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 54 of them are imperatives.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,480
 An imperative is a command.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,240
 (dramatic music)

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:24,160
 That Jesus was not just his half brother, he was his Lord.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,880
 - Well, hello, poor, guys, sorry about that.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,560
 I'm like still putting my things down.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,040
 Hi, friends, my name is Josh Thames,

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,360
 and like you heard, I get to be part of our team

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,120
 over in Fort Worth, so welcome to everybody in the room.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,920
 Welcome to all of our friends online

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,280
 in Scottsdale, Arizona, Boise, Idaho,

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,480
 and especially you in Fort Worth, friends.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,320
 Hey, here's what I wanna do.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,640
 I'm gonna pray for us, and then we'll jump in.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,480
 Sound good?

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,300
 Y'all bow with me.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,860
 Father, thank you for the opportunity tonight

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,860
 to gather around your word,

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,520
 and thank you for the fact that it is living and active

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
 and that it changes hearts.

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,160
 It is a sweet thing to be in a room full of people

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,280
 that want to learn about you, know more about you,

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,960
 and Father, I pray that if there is anyone

25
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,120
 in the room tonight that doesn't know you

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,400
 as their Lord and Savior, would tonight be the night

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
 that you miraculously show them just like,

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,280
 man, how desperately they need you

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,540
 and how great you love them?

30
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,280
 Father, I pray that as we jump into James,

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,440
 would you, man, get me out of the way.

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,560
 Would nothing that I say that comes just from me,

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,400
 Father, be heard tonight,

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,040
 but would you just speak through me?

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,000
 Father, would you clear just my head

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,080
 and all the insecurities that it's easy to have here,

37
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,520
 Father, and may, yeah, again, your word speak through me.

38
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,080
 It's your name we pray, amen.

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,160
 Okay, friends, I'm really excited to be in the room tonight.

40
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
 It's been a while since I've got to be here,

41
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,800
 and here's where I'd like to start.

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,280
 I'd like to tell you guys a little bit about myself, okay?

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,100
 So a little bit about me is I grew up in the Midwest

44
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,940
 on a farm.

45
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,560
 We didn't actually farm it.

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,000
 We just lived on the farm, okay?

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,280
 And then I was one of those kids,

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,440
 I was kind of like geared towards, I don't know,

49
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,800
 adventurous or maybe you might call reckless things.

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,880
 I just loved to do things that were crazy, right?

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,480
 So I had a little like XR70 dirt bike,

52
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,760
 and I would just jump everything, okay?

53
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,200
 It's kind of wired that way.

54
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,000
 And after some time,

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,320
 I was introduced to the wonderful sport of rodeo, okay?

56
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,040
 Specifically bull riding.

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,600
 Wow, okay, thank you.

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,640
 Yeah, yes, yeah, it's really amazing.

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,960
 It's one of your better career choices.

60
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,220
 And so this is what I did.

61
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,400
 Jumped into high school rodeo, okay?

62
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
 Jumped into high school rodeo.

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,600
 And then one day, one of my like high school buddies

64
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,680
 was like, "Bro, we should go down the road.

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,820
 There's a pro rodeo."

66
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,160
 At this point, I'm only 17, right?

67
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,000
 I'm not supposed to be there.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
 Like, we'll just lie to them, tell them we're 18,

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
 we'll get in.

70
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,600
 So I was like, I'm in, I'm in.

71
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,640
 And so we go, go to the first pro rodeo of my life.

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,320
 And that night I ended up winning that thing.

73
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,560
 So in a matter,

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,320
 if you guys don't know how bull riding works,

75
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,120
 you like strap yourself to a really wild animal

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,220
 and then you just like make a funny face

77
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,480
 for as long as possible and try not to fall off, okay?

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
 That's what you do.

79
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,520
 And I did that twice in a row.

80
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,280
 So 16 seconds later, and I made $8,000.

81
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,180
 Right, that's what I thought.

82
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,720
 I was like, I cracked the code.

83
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,440
 I know exactly what I'm gonna do.

84
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,380
 Like, this is gonna be awesome, you know?

85
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,260
 And yeah, throw those pictures back up there.

86
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,860
 I know sometimes I no longer like look or dress

87
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,700
 like I rode bulls anymore.

88
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,980
 So I really, I was trying to like show,

89
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,820
 I really did do this thing.

90
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,640
 It's really fun.

91
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,160
 So that, what I did is I went home to mom and dad

92
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,380
 and I was like, "Mom, dad, it's been great.

93
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,220
 High school was awesome."

94
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,980
 Two weeks into junior year, said, "I'm out."

95
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,600
 I did the math.

96
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,680
 I'm like, I make way more, you know, 16 seconds,

97
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
 eight grand than all of my friends who graduated college.

98
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,520
 You know?

99
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,920
 And so I said no to high school, bought a minivan,

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,260
 turned a little miniature motor home,

101
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,760
 threw my pit bull named cowboy in there

102
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,640
 and off we went, you know?

103
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,620
 My dad, of course, had the like,

104
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,520
 "Doesn't the Bible say something about testing the Lord

105
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,400
 and isn't this kind of dangerous?"

106
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,840
 Like, "Ah, we'll figure it out," you know?

107
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,480
 And so that is what I did.

108
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,220
 And here's why, here's what happened.

109
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,820
 In 16 seconds, my life, I was like,

110
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,400
 "I just made so much money.

111
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,680
 And this is like, this is seriously going to be epic.

112
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,360
 Like I can make all this money, I can do whatever I want.

113
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,680
 I can be totally free."

114
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,960
 Here's the thing about bull riding is like,

115
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,800
 no one's in charge of me.

116
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,620
 I don't have a coach.

117
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,040
 I got to go wherever I wanted to go.

118
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,500
 And then I made $8,000 this night

119
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,760
 and then I did it again and I did it again.

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,240
 And I truly was like, "Man, I'm going to do this."

121
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
 And no matter what person you meet,

122
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,280
 no matter what cowboy or how cowboy they are,

123
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,120
 here's the deal.

124
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
 If someone wasn't paying me,

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 if there wasn't money involved in riding bulls,

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,980
 the only people I do are like your drunk cousins,

127
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,820
 like, "Bro, check this out."

128
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,040
 You know, like no one would actually do this.

129
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,840
 But because of this love of and pursuit of both money

130
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,120
 and the significance that I found in it,

131
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,600
 I dove like head first.

132
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,560
 And it really is like comical to think that like,

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
 I like willingly was strapping myself,

134
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,520
 literally tying myself to 1500 pounds of wild animal

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,520
 in the hopes that I would get a paycheck.

136
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,480
 And so the reason I start there is because James,

137
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,920
 tonight is going to show us that our money talks.

138
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,800
 You can write that down.

139
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,400
 Our money talks.

140
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,800
 Your money says something about you.

141
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,000
 Most of you are thinking, "Yes, my money mostly says goodbye,"

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,080
 which I understand.

143
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,560
 Here's why this is so important though,

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,400
 is because money determines a lot, a lot in your life,

145
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,680
 whether you have it or you don't.

146
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,480
 It determines like where you live, what you do for fun,

147
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,960
 like which college you went to,

148
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,920
 and even like what major you picked,

149
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,880
 what clothes you wear, if you have clothes to wear.

150
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,000
 Money is how we acquire food.

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,020
 It's how we acquire shelter.

152
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,600
 It's also how we acquire value for our skills

153
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,660
 and the work that we do is in exchange for money.

154
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,160
 And here's what that means.

155
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,000
 It's like money just hits different.

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,280
 Like it has a unique role in our lives.

157
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,200
 Like it is like truly,

158
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,160
 like there is something like really deep down,

159
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,320
 even all the way to survival,

160
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,080
 like God in his kindness designed money

161
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,960
 to be something that we needed,

162
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,000
 that we couldn't be dependent.

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,700
 And you see, that's what makes money so dangerous,

164
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,360
 is that because if you get enough of it,

165
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,760
 because it is how you can exchange it for like,

166
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,200
 not only for like clothes and food,

167
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,920
 but how you can begin to like have fun with it.

168
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,280
 And people begin to like look at you different

169
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,360
 if you have a lot of it.

170
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,960
 Money, you gain enough money,

171
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,880
 begins to make you feel like,

172
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,660
 maybe I don't need God.

173
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,280
 Like maybe I can be independent.

174
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,520
 Maybe I can be autonomous.

175
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,640
 And so what was meant to remind us of our dependence

176
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,160
 and need soon becomes why we forget,

177
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
 because we have a lot of it.

178
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,520
 'Cause I'm going, I can take care of myself now.

179
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,880
 I've got money, God, I don't need you.

180
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,860
 You just kind of stay in that place

181
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,240
 and I'll just do whatever I want.

182
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,120
 Here's what I want you to know.

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,840
 This isn't a message where we're trying to get your money

184
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,680
 and also God doesn't want your money.

185
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,720
 He owns it all.

186
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,620
 He doesn't want your money to get you.

187
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,440
 And so James is gonna dive into this this evening.

188
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,680
 And here's the thing.

189
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,400
 Some of you, some of you aren't just putting like

190
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,920
 eight seconds of your life on the line for money.

191
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,680
 Some of you, it's like eight years or 80 years,

192
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,200
 or maybe the entirety of your life

193
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,480
 all centered around the one goal of acquiring more money.

194
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,480
 So as we said already, we are in the book of James

195
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,520
 and James is really cool.

196
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
 This is just for free.

197
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,680
 James, I think is like the greatest to me.

198
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,000
 I'm going like, hey, this is how I know Jesus is real.

199
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,960
 Because James, this dude's brother says he was God.

200
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,180
 And I don't know if you guys have siblings,

201
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,520
 but I don't know what I would have to do.

202
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,600
 One of my siblings is here.

203
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,920
 And what I would have to do to convince him I was God.

204
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,760
 Right?

205
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,960
 And I'm going like, hey, James,

206
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,800
 James is like one of the greatest proofs

207
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,960
 that Jesus was really real.

208
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,800
 And so James, he's the half brother of Jesus.

209
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,160
 And at this time, as he's writing this letter,

210
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,840
 he's the leader of the church in Jerusalem,

211
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,800
 really just the first church that started.

212
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,980
 And he's writing this letter to all the Christians

213
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,400
 that are scattered throughout Palestine.

214
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,240
 Okay.

215
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,980
 And I promise you all this context matters.

216
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,560
 And then a major theme of this book

217
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,440
 is that Christians are to be doers of the word,

218
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,880
 not just hearers.

219
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,600
 That our faith isn't just a simply a matter of the heart,

220
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,120
 but it is something that compels us to action

221
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,800
 and it changes how we live.

222
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,080
 And it's also written in a time

223
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,520
 where there wasn't really a middle class.

224
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,760
 You had rich and you had poor

225
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,720
 and nothing really in between.

226
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,640
 And so this like little section, James 5,

227
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,140
 one through six, get your Bibles, you can turn there,

228
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,480
 is written to, I believe like all Christians

229
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,480
 or all people who are rich, not just rich Christians,

230
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,920
 but everyone who is rich.

231
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,320
 So if you guys are anything like me,

232
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,600
 you're like, hey, thank goodness,

233
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,320
 this guy's talking about being rich.

234
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,160
 I'm out.

235
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,980
 Like, this is not me.

236
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,820
 I'm not gonna listen to him.

237
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,640
 I don't have to worry about what's coming next.

238
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,240
 I can just enjoy the good vibes of good worship

239
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,560
 and then leave here.

240
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,880
 Here's what I want you to do.

241
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,720
 And I really want you to do this.

242
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,200
 And everybody listen online, I want you to do the same thing.

243
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,840
 I want you to pull out your phone for me.

244
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,560
 I want you to pull out your phone.

245
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,560
 I want you to type in, in your browser, howrichami.org.

246
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:00,240
 Howrichami.org.

247
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,480
 And as you guys are doing that,

248
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,600
 I want you to then type in your salary,

249
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,860
 type in what you make and then hit calculate.

250
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,080
 You guys are laughing 'cause you're nervous and I get it.

251
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,720
 It was convicting.

252
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,560
 Here's the deal.

253
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,380
 Here's what I found out.

254
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,140
 If you make $33,500 a year,

255
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,720
 you are in the top 5% of the world.

256
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,880
 I'm gonna say it again, world.

257
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,280
 So I'm not talking like just underdeveloped places,

258
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,780
 but like I'm talking the whole even developed world.

259
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,160
 You're in the top 5% of the world.

260
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,020
 And you might be in your mind, like, I got so much debt.

261
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,440
 I'm still like, man, I'm living off things, you know,

262
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,280
 but here's the deal.

263
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,800
 You might be thinking, it's still not for me.

264
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,320
 I would bet that everyone or close to,

265
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,200
 maybe everyone in the room is gonna leave here tonight

266
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,040
 and you're gonna go home

267
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,960
 and there's gonna be this little like thing on the wall

268
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,800
 that if you're like,

269
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,280
 I think I want it two degrees warmer, you know,

270
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,960
 you can hit that.

271
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,800
 Why do I do that?

272
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,360
 I do that because James,

273
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,360
 this little text really applies to us in the Western world.

274
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,660
 And so tonight we are going to see how you view money,

275
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,800
 how you make money and how you use money reveals

276
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,360
 where you find your security,

277
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,680
 significance and satisfaction.

278
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,680
 Ultimately it reveals who you are living for.

279
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,840
 So jump in with me.

280
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,300
 It's James 5, one through six.

281
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,520
 Says, "Come now, you rich,

282
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,360
 weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you.

283
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
 Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth eaten.

284
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,280
 Your gold and silver have corroded

285
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,800
 and their corrosion will be evidence against you

286
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,580
 and will eat your flesh like fire.

287
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,740
 You have laid up treasure in the last days.

288
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,300
 Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields,

289
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,900
 which you kept back by fraud are crying out against you.

290
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,340
 And the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears

291
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,860
 of the Lord of hosts.

292
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,060
 You have lived on earth in luxury and in self-indulgence.

293
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,400
 You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.

294
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,820
 You have condemned and murdered the righteous person.

295
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,420
 He does not resist you."

296
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,660
 You're gonna be like, bro, James, you hit hard, man.

297
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,380
 Like why you gotta be so like straightforward with this?

298
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,420
 But I think it's really amazing.

299
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,380
 We see inside of here, there's four indictments.

300
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,740
 There's four indictments of the rich people

301
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,700
 that James is talking to.

302
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,460
 First one is this, hoarding riches,

303
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,520
 stealing or withholding wages,

304
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,980
 living in luxury and oppressing the righteous.

305
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,480
 And overall, here's what James is talking about.

306
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,780
 He is talking about the misuse of money

307
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,980
 and what misusing money says about you

308
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,420
 and then what it will bring you.

309
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,420
 So my first point this evening is how you view money

310
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,280
 says something about you.

311
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,360
 How do you view money says something about you.

312
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,440
 I'm just gonna read verses one through three again.

313
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,720
 "Come now you rich, weep and howl for the miseries

314
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,040
 that are coming upon you.

315
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,800
 Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth eaten.

316
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,640
 Your gold and silver have corroded

317
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,600
 and their corrosion will be evidence against you

318
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,520
 and will eat your flesh like fire.

319
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,640
 You have laid up treasures in the last day."

320
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,840
 So what are these guys doing?

321
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,280
 Here's the indictment against them.

322
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,600
 At this point, all of these rich people,

323
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,860
 they're taking all of their stuff

324
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,700
 and they're just hoarding it.

325
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,780
 They're keeping it for themselves.

326
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,720
 There's people in need.

327
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,960
 Like I said, there was rich people

328
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,020
 and there was poor people.

329
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,360
 And even the rich Christians are just going like,

330
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
 hey, no, I'm gonna keep all this to myself.

331
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,940
 To the point that they've hoarded the riches enough

332
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,340
 that it is starting to go to waste.

333
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,000
 Like it's truly just going to waste.

334
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,760
 Like they've decided, hey, I'm gonna keep this.

335
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,000
 And I think there's probably a lot of reasons

336
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,940
 why we would hoard or why they would even hoard riches.

337
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,760
 You know, just maybe it's just like

338
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,840
 plain selfishness or greed.

339
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,720
 But the one I wanna highlight tonight

340
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,080
 is the fact that when you and I have a lot of riches,

341
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,820
 it makes us feel secure.

342
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,680
 Makes us feel secure.

343
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,360
 What they're looking for

344
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,060
 and what they're finding inside of money is their security.

345
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,840
 And what's interesting is that James describes

346
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,900
 the rich people here very differently

347
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,820
 than I think you and I naturally would.

348
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,340
 He's talking about that, man, they should be weeping

349
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,060
 and howling because of the miseries that are coming.

350
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,300
 Like that's very different than how I would describe

351
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,540
 like my friend that's just driving his new Jeep Rubicon

352
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,380
 down to the lake house.

353
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,020
 And like, no matter what happens, like life is set for him.

354
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,860
 I probably am not thinking,

355
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,620
 man, that just looks like a miserable life.

356
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,580
 What's James saying?

357
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,620
 Like, why is he saying that?

358
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,860
 Why is he saying like, here's what the rich have

359
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,180
 and here's what they have coming.

360
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,820
 And what he's talking about here is really the last days.

361
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,420
 When he says, hey, you've stored up treasures

362
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,080
 in the last days, he's talking about when Jesus

363
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,300
 is going to come back and there's a judgment day.

364
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,360
 Where there's gonna be time where he looks at you

365
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,780
 and I and everyone and we will either know him

366
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,680
 or we will not.

367
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,060
 And this is what James is saying.

368
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,380
 Because if you know Jesus, the rest of eternity with him.

369
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,020
 If you don't know Jesus, you spend the rest of eternity

370
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,100
 in the lake of fire.

371
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,780
 And he literally is saying, hey, their riches

372
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,100
 are going to be evidence against them

373
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,700
 and it will lick their flesh like fire.

374
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,120
 'Cause he's going, it will tell me how they have used

375
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,420
 or viewed their riches will tell me

376
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,260
 where their allegiance lies.

377
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,020
 Like who it is that they really love.

378
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,900
 And so they had found security here.

379
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,440
 There's really two things that are happening here.

380
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,540
 They found security one in things that don't last.

381
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,820
 So he's just going like, hey, you like these rich people

382
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,420
 you're putting all of the security

383
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,260
 and things that just are, they're going to rot.

384
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,080
 They're going to go away.

385
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,860
 Like your clothes get eaten, the food will rot.

386
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,180
 It won't ever last.

387
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,180
 They've bought a lie.

388
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,100
 And like, even in the life that we live now,

389
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,820
 like we all know that like it's temporary.

390
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,520
 Like things don't last forever.

391
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,540
 I brought this for you guys for you to see.

392
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,300
 This was a really big deal to me back in the day.

393
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,540
 I don't know if you guys know what this is.

394
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,900
 This is a, it was on the battery dies quick now.

395
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,660
 Yeah, yeah.

396
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,620
 It kind of turns on anyways.

397
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,300
 This thing was a really big deal to me.

398
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,700
 Like I saved up for this thing.

399
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,080
 Like I was pumped about it.

400
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,060
 Like a couple of hundred dollars.

401
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,860
 It's the big one, 160 gigs, you know?

402
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,900
 Yeah, bro.

403
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,020
 And I used to watch movies.

404
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,220
 Hey, don't do this.

405
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,660
 While I was driving on this little thing,

406
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
 kind of like one of these, you know?

407
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,060
 Anyways, this is a really big deal to me.

408
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,660
 I mean, I spent, I like was careful with it.

409
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,620
 I was like, didn't made sure,

410
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,100
 like I didn't leave anywhere someone could steal it.

411
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,420
 I didn't like leave it out in the sun

412
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,940
 where it would get hot, you know?

413
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,500
 Do you know what it does today?

414
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,180
 It sits in a drawer or like,

415
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,060
 it's like sits in like just an extra bag that I have.

416
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,900
 Like, I don't, I don't know.

417
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,180
 There's like an old like electronics

418
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,020
 and it just like sits there.

419
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,300
 Why?

420
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,180
 Things on this earth don't last.

421
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,620
 Friends, we are eternal beings

422
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,840
 and temporary things are never gonna satisfy you

423
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,100
 for the rest of eternity.

424
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,420
 So these, these temporary things

425
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,860
 will never provide the security for the eternal.

426
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,700
 And these people that James was talking to had done this.

427
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,220
 They had put their security in things that don't last.

428
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,980
 And the second thing is that they had a wrong view.

429
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,880
 Their wrong view of money was evidence against them.

430
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,220
 And as I said earlier, Jesus is coming back

431
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,140
 and the big, the determiner on whether or not

432
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,780
 you spend the rest of your life with him

433
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,980
 or the rest of your life or the rest of eternity,

434
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,580
 not your life, the rest of eternity.

435
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,540
 And a lake of fire is whether or not you know Jesus.

436
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,820
 And when he says it's how they have viewed their money

437
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,860
 is going to be evidence.

438
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,060
 It's going to tell me whether or not they know me.

439
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,120
 So I'm gonna say something really, really provocative here.

440
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,060
 Listen, if your relationship with Jesus

441
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,920
 never gets to a place where it moves your money,

442
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,000
 then I would maybe suggest that you maybe don't know Jesus

443
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,100
 like you think you do.

444
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,340
 So what James is saying, he's telling us this,

445
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,840
 he goes, how you view your money will be evidence

446
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,620
 on whether or not you know Jesus.

447
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,340
 Now hear me clearly, money's not bad.

448
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,600
 It's a good thing, God designed it.

449
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,780
 But, and God isn't out to get your money.

450
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,880
 He doesn't want your money to get you.

451
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,380
 And that's what James is saying.

452
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,260
 He's going like, hey, you need to be really careful

453
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,120
 and you need to watch and see what these guys did

454
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,780
 so that you don't make the same mistakes.

455
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,520
 And so these guys had hoard of the riches,

456
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,540
 they were stockpiling their clothes and their metals

457
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,640
 and their valuables.

458
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,560
 That's what they did.

459
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,040
 What do we do?

460
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,360
 How do we do this?

461
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,780
 Well, the way that we stockpile this

462
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,760
 is we put our money in like stocks or Bitcoin,

463
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,700
 bless y'all in that like Bitcoin thing.

464
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,540
 It feels like that's like a whole like secret club

465
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,540
 and y'all have only one goal, tell everybody about Bitcoin.

466
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,360
 (congregation laughing)

467
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,220
 You know, and to acquire as much as possible,

468
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,820
 even if others are in need.

469
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,660
 And why?

470
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,400
 Because it gives us security.

471
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,020
 Because I feel safe when that number

472
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,060
 of my bank account is higher,

473
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,820
 then I feel like I'm good.

474
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,980
 I'm taken care of.

475
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,080
 And here's what's really the ironic thing.

476
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,820
 This was funny, I was trying to get an $100 bill

477
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,660
 and they only had 50.

478
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,480
 So here we go.

479
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,740
 Here's what, you know,

480
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,940
 do you know what it says on all of our bills?

481
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,620
 In God we trust.

482
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,220
 The irony friends.

483
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,360
 No, really the irony and both like the genius,

484
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,900
 but like it's going, hey, in God we trust.

485
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,860
 And we say that, but yet so many of us trust

486
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,620
 in how many of these we have or we don't have.

487
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:36,200
 James would plead with you to evaluate

488
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,760
 and if need be change your view on money.

489
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,240
 Matthew 6, 19 through 21 says this,

490
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,880
 this is Jesus talking.

491
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,840
 And he says, "Do not lay up for yourselves

492
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,320
 "treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy

493
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,100
 "and where thieves break in and steal,

494
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,920
 "but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven

495
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,060
 "where neither moth nor rust destroys

496
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,460
 "and where thieves do not break in and steal.

497
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,140
 "For where your treasure is,

498
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,640
 "there your heart will be also."

499
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,540
 So what's the solution here?

500
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,680
 What's the solution if you see,

501
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
 if you're just honest with yourself,

502
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,540
 be like, I think that I look to money to be my security.

503
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,920
 If you have trusted in Christ, you are secure.

504
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,880
 I just wrote down a few passages here.

505
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,520
 John 1, 12 says this, "I'm a child of God,

506
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
 "I'm God's child."

507
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,880
 Romans 8, 1, "I'm free forever from condemnation."

508
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,160
 Romans 8, 28, "I am assured that in all things

509
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,240
 "God will work for my good."

510
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,000
 Romans 8, 35, "I cannot be separated

511
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,040
 "from the love of Christ."

512
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,640
 Don't buy the lie that acquiring money

513
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,640
 will give you security, because it's a lie.

514
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,120
 That's only found in Jesus.

515
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,560
 And so if you find in your heart,

516
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,480
 I think that's what I'm doing.

517
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,480
 I think that I'm looking to money to be my security.

518
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,680
 I would look to Jesus, tell, hey, I think it's broken.

519
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,380
 I think my view of money is broken.

520
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,640
 God, will you show me how I can be secure in you?

521
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,160
 Not just in this lifetime, but for the rest of eternity.

522
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,800
 So it's a transition, a wrong view of money

523
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,340
 often leads to wrong actions for money.

524
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,840
 A wrong view of money often leads

525
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,560
 to wrong actions for money.

526
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,740
 This is verse four, "Behold, the wages of the laborers

527
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,000
 "who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud,

528
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,060
 "are crying out against you.

529
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,080
 "And the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears

530
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
 "of the Lord of hosts."

531
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,640
 My second point this evening is this,

532
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,640
 how you make money says something about you.

533
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,560
 So what were these guys doing?

534
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,480
 These guys were withholding wages from their workers

535
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,080
 to make, in order to make more for themselves.

536
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,960
 Here was the goal, money was the goal,

537
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,460
 whatever means necessary.

538
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,760
 So that's what these guys were doing.

539
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,200
 And I think there's a lot of reasons

540
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,560
 as to why they, or you and I,

541
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,260
 would make money for unjust reasons.

542
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,840
 But the one I wanted to like highlight this evening

543
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,740
 is because we often find in money our significance.

544
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,760
 Like I'm able to go like, I feel significant

545
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,200
 when I have a lot of it.

546
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,040
 So that's what we're gonna talk about,

547
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,280
 it's just like how we make money

548
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,360
 sometimes makes us feel like we are significant.

549
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,640
 We like having, or we like what money,

550
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,960
 having money says about us.

551
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
 Look, here's the deal, we all know the four to four

552
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,280
 works just as good and as functional as the G-Wagon.

553
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,680
 Yeah, okay.

554
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,240
 But why do we want the G-Wagon?

555
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,140
 Because it says something about us, right?

556
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,080
 Because when I pull up and think,

557
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,660
 hey, it's a status symbol, right?

558
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,860
 I'm going, hey, I'm driving this.

559
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,300
 Why do I want the G-Wagon over the Explorer?

560
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,660
 Look, and every single one of us

561
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,400
 could go buy a pair of like white sneakers,

562
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,980
 scuff them up, put a little star on them, right?

563
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,100
 Y'all know where I'm going.

564
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,380
 Y'all already know where we're going.

565
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,940
 But instead, what are we doing?

566
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,720
 What are we doing?

567
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,100
 We could buy any hoodie with a smiley face on it,

568
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,940
 but instead, what are we buying?

569
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,580
 We're buying Drew house hoodie, right?

570
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,720
 Why?

571
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,700
 Because it says something about us.

572
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,420
 Instead of any functional leather purse,

573
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,540
 we buy the Birkin bag.

574
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,380
 Why?

575
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,340
 Because they make you feel significant.

576
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,020
 Like when you have things,

577
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,660
 when you have things that money buy you,

578
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,900
 it's easy to begin to go like, hey, I'm significant here.

579
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,540
 And here's what's really broken.

580
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,700
 Here's what this like, this grieves me.

581
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,860
 When we have a lot of money,

582
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,900
 it begins not just to like, I feel significant,

583
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,280
 but I also begin to think

584
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,460
 that I am more significant than you

585
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,960
 based off of how much money I do or don't make,

586
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,980
 or how much money you do or don't make.

587
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,340
 And we do this, it's like, it's crazy how naturally we do.

588
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,180
 So if someone walks in the room

589
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,540
 that we know is really wealthy,

590
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,500
 the way that you treat them versus someone who's maybe not.

591
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:50,100
 Here's the deal.

592
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,980
 You're not alone in that.

593
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,620
 Like in those pictures, and this is,

594
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,180
 I found this, I like remember this.

595
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,320
 In those pictures that I showed you guys

596
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,240
 of me riding bulls, those boots that I was wearing

597
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,600
 were $400 and that hat I was wearing was $600.

598
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,840
 So things that are literally gonna end up in bull crap

599
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,240
 were things that I paid $1,000 for.

600
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,400
 $1,000 because there was like,

601
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
 kind of like the name brand one,

602
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,440
 like it was a special company that made it custom fit

603
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,560
 to my head and to my feet, you know, it's lizard skin.

604
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,400
 That's cool.

605
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,920
 We all get here because we like the way

606
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,680
 that money makes us feel and the significance we find in it.

607
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,100
 Now, here's what happens when we do this though,

608
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,040
 is that now we need money just to keep up this image

609
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,240
 that we've built.

610
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,640
 'Cause all those times you've just like

611
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
 swiped that credit card, you know,

612
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,960
 you don't own much of anything.

613
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,320
 And really you're just a slave to payments.

614
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,840
 And so what does this do?

615
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,480
 This makes you and I more susceptible,

616
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,640
 more susceptible to make money any way that you can,

617
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,560
 even if it hurts others in the process.

618
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,680
 God cares about how you make money.

619
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,620
 So if they were holding back wages from their workers,

620
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,500
 what do we do?

621
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,340
 It looks like for us,

622
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,820
 like running over people to make more money,

623
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,740
 that might look like for you,

624
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,860
 maybe you gossiped about a coworker in front of your boss

625
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,080
 so that maybe you would get the promotion.

626
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,100
 Or maybe instead of faithfully working all eight hours,

627
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,380
 you spend about an hour and a half on Instagram at work,

628
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,140
 but you're kind of like, hey, you know, it's all right.

629
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,720
 Or maybe you justify leaving like a really terrible tip.

630
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,200
 I mean, it did take them five minutes

631
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,800
 to get your sweet tea, you know.

632
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,240
 This is how we do it.

633
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,920
 We begin to go like, no, no, I'm gonna like hold onto this.

634
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,760
 I want more of it.

635
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,000
 I don't wanna have to like give it away.

636
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,160
 So even if that means I'm putting someone else like down,

637
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,480
 or even if that means I'm hurting someone else,

638
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,760
 I'm willing to do so.

639
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,560
 And James is saying that the money acquired

640
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,560
 in an unjust way is crying out to the Lord and he hears it.

641
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,300
 And man, I get this temptation.

642
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
 I get this.

643
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,940
 Like one of the things that I kind of do as like a side gig

644
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,340
 is I like sell gym equipment.

645
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,320
 I know that's random, but I do that.

646
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,020
 And so there was one day I found like a Concept2 rower.

647
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,860
 It was $600.

648
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,380
 I'm like, yes, I'm in, bought that thing.

649
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,340
 And then someone's like, hey, I'll pay you 9.50 for it.

650
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,180
 I was like, boom, done.

651
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,140
 You come pick it up tomorrow.

652
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,740
 And then someone else got ahold of me and they're like,

653
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,580
 hey, I'll pay you 1,200 for it and I'll show up tonight.

654
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,740
 And I was like, I'm in bro.

655
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,580
 I'm not kidding.

656
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,400
 I was like, yeah, I'm in.

657
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,860
 I'd committed to this person

658
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,260
 that I was gonna sell them this rower for $950.

659
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,340
 And then I like sat in that.

660
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,140
 Like my heart got, like I was, I like felt sick

661
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,020
 and I just had to get ahold of him and said,

662
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,380
 hey, I like can't do it because I'd said to someone else,

663
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,780
 I'd committed that I was going to sell them this rower

664
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,740
 for a different price.

665
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,740
 And we are all tempted to do this.

666
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,020
 Friends, how you make money says something about you.

667
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,460
 What's the solution here?

668
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,300
 How do we do this?

669
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,820
 If we begin to go like, yes, the way that I make money

670
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,880
 or how much money I make begins to how I view myself

671
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,000
 or what I think of myself

672
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,840
 or even the significance that I find, here's the solution.

673
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,840
 Treasure Christ and not worldly status or significance.

674
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,200
 Like treasure Christ, 2 Corinthians 8, 9 says this,

675
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,020
 for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ

676
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,240
 that though he was rich, yet for your sake became poor

677
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,240
 so that you by his poverty might become rich.

678
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,340
 Friends, like keep an eternal perspective.

679
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,620
 Like just don't buy the lie.

680
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,260
 Like really truly like there's riches found in Jesus.

681
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,100
 He who had everything who was rich became poor

682
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,960
 so that you and I, if we trust in him,

683
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,900
 we can have ultimate riches.

684
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,060
 Like the greatest riches, the riches that last forever.

685
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,220
 Or this time, because of Christ, I am significant.

686
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,220
 Matthew 5, 14, I'm the light of the world.

687
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,740
 2 Corinthians 6, 1, I'm God's fellow worker.

688
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,700
 1 Corinthians 3, 16, I am God's temple in Christ.

689
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,820
 In Christ is where you find your true significance.

690
00:26:52,820 --> 00:27:02,860
 In the transition, James moves on from how we view money,

691
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,980
 how we make money, and then how we use money.

692
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,160
 Verses five and six, you have lived on earth in luxury

693
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,800
 and in self-indulgence.

694
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,540
 You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.

695
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,660
 You have condemned and murdered the righteous person.

696
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,520
 He does not resist you.

697
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,020
 The third point this evening is this,

698
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,440
 how you use money says something about you.

699
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,720
 So what were these guys doing?

700
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,220
 Hey, they were living in luxury and in self-indulgence,

701
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,880
 which just led to murdering the righteous person.

702
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,980
 And what James is speaking of here,

703
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,100
 it's not that they were walking around with swords

704
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,260
 and just like killing people.

705
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,180
 No, he's talking about like a judicial injustice

706
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,880
 where like, hey, they had the money to pay

707
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,940
 for the high-powered lawyers,

708
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,140
 and they can begin to oppress and take from the poor

709
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,020
 whatever they wanted,

710
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,260
 because the poor, and the poor person

711
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,180
 couldn't do anything about it

712
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,220
 'cause they couldn't pay for the lawyers.

713
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,220
 They couldn't represent themselves.

714
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,380
 They couldn't work the system

715
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,860
 like someone with a lot of money did.

716
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,480
 And so because he was taking their stuff

717
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 and their means of life, food and water and shelter,

718
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,640
 this is how they were murdering the poor.

719
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,580
 They were living in luxury and using their money

720
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,740
 to get what they want.

721
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,100
 There's like a really interesting,

722
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,260
 the like last half of five is interesting here.

723
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,100
 What James says, says,

724
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,740
 "You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter."

725
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,580
 Like what?

726
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,140
 Feels a little confusing, you know?

727
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,620
 What's he talking about here?

728
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,920
 The image that James is using is that of a cow

729
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,140
 that is like indulging itself and making itself fatter,

730
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,840
 which in turn is making it more likely

731
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,640
 to be the one that gets slaughtered.

732
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,420
 Get it?

733
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,260
 Yeah, that's what's happening.

734
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,180
 He's going like, hey, as they are doing this,

735
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,500
 you have, you've done the same thing

736
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,740
 in the way that you are making money,

737
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,960
 the way that you are using money,

738
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,620
 all it's doing is being evidence against you.

739
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,860
 You are just making it more and more obvious

740
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,660
 that when the day of judgment comes,

741
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,900
 whose side you're on.

742
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,020
 You've either worshiped God or you've worshiped money.

743
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,880
 So there are a lot of ways to use your money,

744
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,500
 but I want to highlight the way that we use it

745
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,300
 to find our satisfaction.

746
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,620
 See, there's a great difference

747
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,780
 between enjoying what God has given you

748
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,660
 and living extravagantly and selfishly.

749
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,740
 And hear me loud and clear, friends.

750
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,020
 Like God wants you to enjoy life.

751
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,460
 Like it's okay, like if you want both scoops of Rocky Road,

752
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,640
 go for it, you know?

753
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,540
 Like God isn't trying to like rob you of fun,

754
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,820
 but there is a difference between enjoying

755
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,700
 what God has given you and then living in a place

756
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,540
 of luxury and indulgence.

757
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,540
 And here's the thing, it's not actually your money.

758
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,180
 Like God owns all of it.

759
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,140
 Like we're just stewards of it.

760
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,540
 Like God's got it to us on loan.

761
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,620
 He's going like, "Hey, I'm entrusting this to you

762
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,460
 "so that you can use it."

763
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,280
 And then how we use it is going to like be evidence

764
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,500
 of where our allegiance lies.

765
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,260
 It's God's money.

766
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,260
 And here's the thing, luxury is interesting.

767
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,160
 Luxury has a way of ruining character.

768
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,540
 The proverb says that the rich man answers roughly.

769
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,000
 Why does the rich man answer roughly?

770
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,340
 Because he thinks he's more important.

771
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,740
 He's kind of like, "Hey, you're just this person

772
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,720
 "because I have more than you.

773
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,660
 "I can treat you in a certain way."

774
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,140
 See, living in luxury, it like tends to make you

775
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:19,100
 fat and selfish and soft and entitled.

776
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:24,260
 Here's the thing, if you match self-indulgence with wealth,

777
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,300
 the result is sin.

778
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,060
 If you match self-indulgence,

779
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,500
 I'm sorry, if you, wow,

780
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,700
 if you match self-indulgence with wealth,

781
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,840
 the result is sin.

782
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,360
 But if you match character with wealth,

783
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,460
 you can produce much, much good.

784
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,580
 How you use money says something about you.

785
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,820
 Let me just ask you this.

786
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,940
 What'd you do when you got your stimulus check?

787
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,860
 Where'd the stimmy go?

788
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,280
 You know, where you guys like, "This is awesome.

789
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,300
 "That debt I've been paying,

790
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,980
 "that debt I've been needing to pay off, here we go.

791
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
 "I'll put it to that."

792
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,220
 Or, "Hey, I know someone who's really been impacted

793
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,920
 "by this pandemic, I bet they really need this money."

794
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,480
 Or, "Did you get the new pair of Jordans

795
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,340
 "that you won't like kneel down and crease?"

796
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,440
 Like, where'd that go?

797
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,540
 How are you using it?

798
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,460
 When you think about it, it's not your money.

799
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,960
 I just think, hear me on this.

800
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,560
 I don't think it's very often that when we look

801
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,500
 at getting more money that we go,

802
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,720
 "Hey, this should make me be cautious.

803
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,520
 "Like I should be aware this is a dangerous thing."

804
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,420
 This is what James is telling us.

805
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,380
 Hey, it's a really dangerous thing.

806
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,340
 Like just having more money isn't always a good thing,

807
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,100
 or at least you need to be aware

808
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,920
 of when you make more money.

809
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,920
 It's kind of like, we got a fireplace at my house

810
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,100
 and man, fire is a good thing.

811
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,780
 It's amazing warmth, you know, like ambiance and light.

812
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,940
 It's like a really, really good thing.

813
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,340
 But if I just decided, you know what?

814
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,420
 More fire is always better.

815
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,660
 And I was like, "Hey, I got this eight foot log.

816
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,140
 "Come on, baby, throw that thing on."

817
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,340
 You know, what would happen?

818
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,180
 What would happen?

819
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,720
 Very shortly, I would no longer have a house, right?

820
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,040
 Right, so fire has the ability

821
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,340
 to both be a really amazing thing,

822
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,220
 but then also take everything.

823
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,400
 And money's really interesting.

824
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,920
 I think that, man, I would just implore you.

825
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,400
 As you think about just getting more money,

826
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,240
 are you aware of the danger of it?

827
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,280
 Are you going like, "Hey God,

828
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,900
 "what would you have me do with this

829
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,240
 "so that it doesn't begin to pull on my heart?"

830
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,080
 So these guys were living in luxury,

831
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,280
 it was leading them to murder the righteous.

832
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,320
 And what does that mean though for us?

833
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,200
 How does this apply to us?

834
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,720
 And here's just what I wrote down.

835
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,400
 It's like, is your first thought

836
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,640
 of how can you use your money for your own enjoyment

837
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,960
 and your own fun and your own vacation?

838
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,800
 Or is your thought like,

839
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,120
 "How can I use this to provide or bless for others?"

840
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,620
 And here's the thing, your bank statement is a gift to you.

841
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,720
 Like truly, it is a gift to you.

842
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,680
 No one else can see it,

843
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,760
 but you can go back there and go like,

844
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,440
 if you wanna know where your heart is at,

845
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,320
 if you wanna know what it is, the things you're valuing,

846
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,080
 if you wanna know how you're using your money

847
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,760
 or who you're using your money on,

848
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,080
 go look at your bank statement.

849
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,120
 Like, is it like dinner at HG,

850
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,640
 you know, and then it's the Dillards and Nike,

851
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,920
 and then that manicure, that coffee shop.

852
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,600
 What's it saying about you?

853
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,640
 It really is a gift to you, think about that.

854
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
 Think about like, like he's saying, it's evidence.

855
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,920
 How you spend your money is evidence.

856
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,720
 Look, are you looking at your bank statement going like,

857
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,320
 "God, how do I view my money?

858
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,160
 How am I making it?

859
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,800
 How am I using it?"

860
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,640
 We often use money as a means to our own satisfaction,

861
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,980
 and it reveals where our heart is.

862
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:38,400
 The solution to this is to run to God to be satisfied.

863
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,280
 Look, friends, he's the one who made you.

864
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,440
 Look at me for a second.

865
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,280
 God made you on purpose and with a purpose.

866
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,240
 He knows exactly how you work.

867
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,840
 And he is the only one that can truly provide you

868
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,700
 satisfaction forever.

869
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,560
 And anything other than God is a fake, it's a phony.

870
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,840
 It will only give you satisfaction for a moment.

871
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,600
 Don't buy the lie.

872
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,780
 Don't buy it.

873
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,880
 Run to God, Psalm 16, 11 says this,

874
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,680
 "You make known to me the path of life.

875
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:17,480
 In your presence, there is fullness of joy.

876
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,480
 At your right hand are pleasures forevermore."

877
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,000
 Forever, did you hear that?

878
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,840
 In your presence, God, in your presence alone

879
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,160
 is where I am fully satisfied,

880
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,040
 where there's pleasures forevermore.

881
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,340
 Money's never going to do it.

882
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:41,040
 So in review, if you view your money as your security,

883
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,840
 if you make money for significance,

884
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,680
 and if you use your money for your own satisfaction,

885
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,240
 here's the reality.

886
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,860
 In the end, it will come back painfully,

887
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,020
 painfully empty.

888
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,680
 And when Jesus comes back,

889
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,580
 it will also be evidence on who it is that you served.

890
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,000
 Matthew 6, 24 says this,

891
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,420
 "No one can serve two masters,

892
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,520
 for either he will hate the one and love the other,

893
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,480
 or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.

894
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,640
 You cannot serve God and money."

895
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,280
 Do y'all hear me on that?

896
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,800
 Like, you just can't do it.

897
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,720
 Like, it's impossible if you're like,

898
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,560
 "Yeah, I live for God,

899
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
 but I also like live for money over here."

900
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,880
 You either live for one or the other,

901
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,260
 and he's just saying like how you view your money,

902
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,520
 how you make your money,

903
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,720
 and how you use it is going to tell you

904
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,920
 who is it you're living for, who's your master.

905
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,520
 Here's where I wanna close,

906
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,520
 is the Bible says that our hearts are desperately sick

907
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,720
 and intent on evil,

908
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,220
 and that we are in desperate need of a savior.

909
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,900
 Here's how this worked for me.

910
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,840
 So for seven years of my life, I did that.

911
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,840
 I ran off, rode bulls, and I like made it.

912
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,160
 I was like making the money.

913
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,840
 I had the girlfriend, you know, people knew my name.

914
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,020
 And then God, in his kindness,

915
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,120
 on a fall day, Prescott, Arizona,

916
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,160
 instead of on top of a bull, I ended up underneath a bull.

917
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,920
 And I took both of his hooves to my chest,

918
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,920
 one here, one here,

919
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,640
 collapsed both of my lungs,

920
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,140
 broke all but two of my ribs,

921
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,080
 cut my liver in half,

922
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,320
 and rearranged all the like major organs, okay?

923
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,320
 And that sent me to the ICU for the next week.

924
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,000
 And here's what's amazing.

925
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,840
 God, in his kindness, he broke me in one fatal swoop.

926
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,720
 He broke me physically, financially, and spiritually.

927
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,880
 All that money that I had made, guess where it went?

928
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,580
 Yeah, 200 grand of hospital bills.

929
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,880
 Yeah, that's where that went.

930
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,020
 But I began to realize something,

931
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,360
 I'm not big enough to be God.

932
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,960
 Like I've made myself God.

933
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,040
 I've made looking for significance, security,

934
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,880
 and satisfaction in things that aren't God,

935
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,280
 like I need to think about what I'm doing

936
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,760
 because I realized in that moment, I'm like,

937
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,840
 God, if you were to come back right now,

938
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,520
 or if I'm not gonna wake up tomorrow morning,

939
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,940
 I know exactly where I'd go.

940
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,640
 I was at least honest enough with myself

941
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,080
 and I'd been taught really well by my father.

942
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,960
 I knew, I knew that if Jesus came back that moment,

943
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,360
 he would look at me and say, I never knew you.

944
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,160
 (soft music)

945
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,340
 Here's the deal, like you, if you're going,

946
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,260
 I think I might have a broken view of money.

947
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,980
 You are unable to save yourself.

948
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,420
 Like you just can't do it.

949
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,180
 Like you're unable, like if your heart is sick,

950
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,980
 like you in and of yourself can't do it,

951
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,100
 it's going to take God in your life.

952
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,660
 And God, look at me, he already did.

953
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,620
 He came down as a man in the form of Jesus

954
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,640
 who lived perfectly.

955
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,720
 And then he died on the cross, like he forever,

956
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,000
 the greatest injustice ever done in all of life,

957
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,460
 the greatest, like most ugly thing,

958
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,440
 also the most beautiful thing to ever happen,

959
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,700
 God did for you and for me,

960
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,740
 so that he could free us of the way

961
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,780
 that we search for things outside of him.

962
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:30,320
 And that someday, oh, like glorious day that it will be

963
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,520
 when he comes back down, that you could be someone

964
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,500
 that he would look at you and go,

965
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,700
 hey, you've done my will, you're with me.

966
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,540
 And I want that for you.

967
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,540
 I want that for you.

968
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,440
 I don't want you to hear I never knew you.

969
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,280
 But friends, a major barrier to that

970
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,300
 is you and your relationship with money.

971
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,140
 Pray for us.

972
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,020
 Father, thank you for who you are

973
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,840
 and just your kindness

974
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,680
 in the way that despite us, despite us, God,

975
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:13,260
 you moved towards us, said while we were your enemies,

976
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,200
 you died for us.

977
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,680
 And I just like confess in my heart,

978
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,640
 it is so easy for me to start making money, my God,

979
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,360
 for me to have false gods, for me to reject you,

980
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,460
 to live for myself.

981
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,560
 Father, may we be people who understand

982
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,860
 that there is riches forevermore.

983
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,180
 By your side.

984
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,580
 Thank you for this.

985
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,500
 Group of people, everybody listening here and online,

986
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,460
 man, Father, would you, in only ways that you can,

987
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,220
 would you move in the hearts that still need you

988
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,500
 to regenerate them, to show them that you alone,

989
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,040
 you alone can satisfy.

990
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,460
 I love you a lot.

991
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,740
 It's your name I pray, amen.
