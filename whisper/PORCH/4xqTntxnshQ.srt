00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,640
 All right, well, good evening, ports.

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,360
 It's good to be with you.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,040
 And I've got a little crew that's here with me.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,840
 We're slowly adding back to our numbers.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,280
 >> [APPLAUSE] >> So not the crowd we usually love to

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,400
 have present with us, but we're glad that you are present with us online.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,360
 And as JD just shared, we are starting a new series called the Seven Deadly Sins.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,480
 And my name is Todd and I love being with you guys when I get to jump in.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,720
 I hang out with the rest of the crew here at Watermark.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,560
 And it's a privilege to be with you guys tonight.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,440
 This series, Seven Deadly Sins, I mean,

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,000
 it's kind of not the best series to get pitched to to kick it off, right?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,400
 I mean, sin's not everybody's favorite topic.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,520
 It's one of those things that when we kind of hear about it,

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,320
 we start to kind of crouch down like, I'm not really sure I wanna talk about my sins

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,360
 or talk about sin in general, it's not a very popular topic ever.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,440
 And especially even in some environments that we would call churches,

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,960
 you don't hear sin talked about very much, which is crazy.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,480
 Until sin is bitter, Christ will never be sweet.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,720
 And so we're gonna talk about seven deadly sins.

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,760
 And let me just start this whole series off by saying this, man,

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,920
 all sins are deadly, all right?

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,840
 You know, I've been asked the question before, are some sins worse than others?

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,560
 And it depends on what you really mean when you talk about that, right?

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,760
 Because if you're asking me if you would rather speak a poor word about me,

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,480
 either in my presence or behind my back, or clock me in my face,

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,440
 or take a machete to my throat, neither one of them or none of them

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,600
 are really things that I would prefer that you do.

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,720
 But if I've got to choose between you speaking poorly of me or taking a machete

31
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,040
 to my throat, you know, I'm definitely gonna say, go ahead and say a bad word

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,040
 about me because I don't want anybody to really come at me, you know,

33
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,960
 hard with a machete.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,840
 That doesn't usually go well for me when that happens.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,400
 And so in terms of its effect, and by the way, we have this sense, right,

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,840
 in our world that there are laws that when we break, you sometimes,

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,880
 we call them misdemeanors where you would, you know, get a fine for running a stop

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,840
 sign or you get a fine if you kind of make your way to an intersection after that

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,240
 yellow light wasn't so yellow anymore.

40
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,760
 And then there are other things where we go, "Hey, it's not going to just be a fine

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,840
 or a ticket and a nuisance and a couple of hundred bucks.

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,080
 It's going to be a couple of decades in prison."

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,600
 Or in certain cases, it can even be life for a life.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,400
 And so even in our world, in our relationship with one another,

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,560
 we realize there are certain things that we do to one another that have more

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,560
 grievous effects.

47
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,720
 But what all sin does is it breaks and hurts relationship, and that's ultimately

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,480
 what sin does in our relationship with God.

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,760
 Sin separates us from God, and every sin separates us from God.

50
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,520
 Let me just back this up a little bit and talk about why we want to encourage you

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,000
 guys to make war against sin, right?

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,360
 Because sin is not your friend.

53
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,080
 It always advertises itself like that, right?

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,440
 It always comes at you like, "Hey, man, this is going to make you feel good

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,160
 for a little bit.

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,680
 It's going to make others attracted to you.

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,640
 It's going to make you feel better about yourself."

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,200
 I mean, if it wasn't attractive, we wouldn't give ourself away to it.

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,080
 But there's something about the deceitfulness of sin that is seductive

60
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,920
 to all of us.

61
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,560
 This series that we're doing called The Seven Deadly Sins, and you saw it there

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,440
 in what we kind of call our porch bumper, we grabbed this title that's kind of a very

63
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,400
 familiar title to us, The Seven Deadly Sins, and we mentioned them,

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,920
 you know, lust, and pride, and anger, and greed, and gluttony, and sloth,

65
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,040
 or laziness, and then envy, or jealousy.

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,560
 Those are the seven deadly sins that we're going to talk about in the weeks ahead.

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,360
 And I want you to tune in as we focus in on each of those because we're going to

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,920
 talk to you about, what we're going to do is come at you with some truth about all

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,640
 seven of those things.

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:38,920
 I mean, every single one of them have some momentary source of gladness to us.

71
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:45,400
 But in the end, when you give yourself to them, it doesn't go very well for us

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,320
 for very long.

73
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,560
 It's a phrase that has been long shared by many people where sin will cost you more

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,080
 than you want to pay.

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,520
 It'll take you farther than you want to go, and it'll keep you longer than you

76
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,640
 want to stay.

77
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,360
 That's what sin always does.

78
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,600
 And so, we're going to take each of those seven sins and those seven deadly paths,

79
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,920
 and we're going to really tell you the truth about what's on those paths.

80
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,720
 We're going to let you know what happens when you swallow the hook,

81
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,280
 and don't just get that momentary sense of satisfaction.

82
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,560
 But tonight, what we want to do is set up the series by just talking about sin

83
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,080
 in general.

84
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,800
 Just one more quick comment about the seven deadly sins.

85
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,480
 There isn't seven deadly sins in your Bible.

86
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,560
 The Bible says if a man keeps the whole law and yet offends on one point,

87
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,480
 he is a lawbreaker, and he's a sinner.

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,360
 And the Bible says that God is holy, and because he's holy,

89
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,920
 he can't have fellowship with that which is not like him because it would

90
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,680
 compromise him.

91
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,920
 You guys know that, right?

92
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,840
 If I've got a water jug that's right here that's just good pure water,

93
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,920
 and I just put like a drop or two of poison or cyanide in there,

94
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,560
 you're not going to go, "Oh, well, it's mostly water."

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
 You're going to go, "No, that's contaminated.

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
 It's no longer trustworthy.

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,880
 It's no longer good."

98
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,760
 And so, you don't want that water anymore, and God will never change his character

99
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,280
 and his nature.

100
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,760
 And so, he wants a relationship with us, but when we become unlike him,

101
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,200
 when we leave his will for us, it separates us from him,

102
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,680
 and that ultimately is the problem with sin.

103
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:36,440
 It breaks relationship with the God who is the God of life and the God of love,

104
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,920
 the God of peace, the God who is light.

105
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,680
 And so, when you leave the God who is life and love and peace and light,

106
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,800
 you're going to get hatred and war and depression and despair and darkness

107
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,360
 and death.

108
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,360
 And that's why God hates sin, because he loves you.

109
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,320
 There isn't seven deadly sins in the Bible.

110
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,280
 I'll show you in just a moment the closest thing we have to a list in the Bible

111
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,440
 of seven deadly sins.

112
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,040
 The idea of seven deadly sins actually came from what's called the Desert Father.

113
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,040
 So, you know, just to take you back a little bit, after Jesus was here on earth

114
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,360
 and he died for our sins, you're going to have a moment where there

115
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,200
 were men that as they began to follow him became some of the early what we call

116
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
 church fathers.

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,320
 They took the words of the apostles and they taught them and they studied them

118
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,920
 and they developed the theology of the church based on what Jesus had given

119
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,720
 to his disciples, who then with the assistance of God and the Holy Spirit

120
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,080
 recorded and God brought to remembrance the things that he wanted them

121
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,760
 to remember and record the things he wanted them to record.

122
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,240
 And then he built out our Bible.

123
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,760
 And so, these guys would study that and they would write.

124
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,280
 And some of the early Desert Fathers were guys that basically became the leaders

125
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,600
 of what was later the monastic community.

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,920
 They would go out to the desert and they would study and they would seek to be holy

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,800
 in the way that they lived their lives.

128
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,840
 And so, there was a brother whose name was Evagrius Ponticus.

129
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,800
 There should be eight deadly sins.

130
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,240
 Like the seven we mentioned and naming your kid Evagrius Ponticus, right?

131
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,480
 I mean, that's a problem, okay?

132
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,360
 You don't go to elementary school with a lot of Evagriuses and there's a good

133
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,560
 reason for it.

134
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,840
 But Evagrius Ponticus is the very first guy that made a list of actually about eight

135
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,240
 things that he said, "You've got to really avoid these thoughts and you've got

136
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,840
 to avoid these activities or they're going to do what one of the apostles wrote.

137
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,680
 They're going to wage war against your soul."

138
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,320
 And who wants to declare war on themselves?

139
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,120
 When you embrace sin, that's what you do.

140
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,080
 You declare war on your own heart.

141
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,000
 Now, it's so interesting.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,160
 And by the way, I'll just take it a little bit further just to kind of wrap up the

143
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,360
 seven deadly sins.

144
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,200
 It was about in the sixth century, so about 560, one of the popes, Pope Gregory,

145
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,520
 boiled down that list of eight or nine down to seven specific sins.

146
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,400
 And they're the ones that we listed for you here.

147
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,640
 There have been movies made about them.

148
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,760
 I don't know if you guys are into Netflix.

149
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,800
 There's actually a Japanese anime called "The Seven Deadly Sins" that showed up a

150
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,960
 number of years ago on Netflix.

151
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,720
 There's a number of books.

152
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,240
 There's songs.

153
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,520
 This little phrase has kind of made its way into our society.

154
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,840
 But you need to know this.

155
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,040
 There isn't, according to God's eyes, what has been adapted within that lineage

156
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,720
 that came from Pope Gregory, the Roman Catholic Church, there isn't,

157
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,880
 in God's eyes, sins that are venial, which means forgivable if you,

158
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,080
 you know, do them and don't even repent of them.

159
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,240
 A venial sin, that just is a word that means forgivable, right?

160
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,400
 They weaken your relationship with God.

161
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,680
 They injure your relationship with God, but they're not mortal.

162
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,240
 So sometimes those of you guys that grew up around a Roman Catholic context,

163
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,520
 you might hear about venial sins, which means forgivable even without formal

164
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:14,160
 repentance, and mortal sins, which there's dozens of them, not just seven,

165
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,440
 that they will tell you, "Man, if you don't repent of these and get

166
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,000
 to confessional and go through the penance process before you die,

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,200
 then you have not just weakened grace or injured grace,

168
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,640
 you have eliminated grace."

169
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,080
 And it's why so many of us have this mindset like, "Man, I did this thing,

170
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,200
 and if I get killed now before I get to church, cross the street,

171
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,560
 get hit by a bus, man, I'm in trouble."

172
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,000
 And you need to know something, we're all in trouble.

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,160
 If a man keeps the whole law, and yet offends in one point,

174
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,600
 James says, he is guilty of the whole law.

175
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,640
 He's a lawbreaker.

176
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,000
 And we're no longer holy, and we no longer have a relationship with God.

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,880
 This is a verse that I'll just use to kind of set this up,

178
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,360
 in Isaiah 59, verse 1 and 2.

179
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,160
 Isaiah is writing to this people that have been separated from God,

180
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,840
 and Isaiah 59, verse 1 says, "Behold, the Lord's hand is not so short

181
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,000
 that it cannot save, and his ear is not so dull that he cannot hear."

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,720
 But here's the deal.

183
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,440
 The reason you're not experiencing the blessing of relationship with God is

184
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,960
 because you're really indifferent to who God is.

185
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,160
 You go your own way, you make your own gods, you are your own God,

186
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,440
 and so you choose your own good, and you choose your own life path,

187
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,040
 instead of returning to the way that the God who loves you,

188
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:54,200
 who is love, and light, and life, you choose hatred, and darkness, and death.

189
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,840
 This is what it says in Isaiah 59, verse 2, it says, "Your iniquities,"

190
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,400
 which is just a fancy biblical word for sin,

191
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,280
 "Your iniquities have made a separation."

192
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,880
 You see that word? It's awful.

193
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
 A separation between you and your God.

194
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,920
 "And your sins have hidden his face from you so that he doesn't hear."

195
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,280
 So again, you need to know this.

196
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,440
 Every sin is deadly because it separates us from God.

197
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,120
 And every sin needs to be taken to him and confessed that, look, this is earth.

198
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,200
 None of us are ever going to be free from sin's temptation.

199
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,880
 Temptation isn't sin.

200
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,560
 Christians still sin.

201
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,160
 We still quench the goodness of God in our life and grieve God

202
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,480
 by going our own way, even though we love him.

203
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
 And the Bible tells us, you know, I mean, I will say this,

204
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,320
 that we ought to live in a continual state of repentance while we're here,

205
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,280
 of constantly acknowledging that there is a God that is good,

206
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,840
 and his way is right, and his way is true, and that we need him.

207
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,280
 And apart from him, we can do nothing.

208
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,560
 And we need to acknowledge that what the Scripture says is true,

209
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,360
 that no sin or temptation comes to us that overtakes us in such a way

210
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,200
 that it's not common to everybody else.

211
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,520
 One of the things that's going to be so true as you go through the seven deadly sins

212
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,280
 is you're going to find one, and you go, "Man, nobody lusts like I lust.

213
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
 Nobody struggles with greed the way I do.

214
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:24,520
 Nobody is as prone to envy or laziness or anger as I am.

215
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,720
 And if you knew I was raised, you would know that it's not easy for me to be,

216
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,120
 you know, calm all the time."

217
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,920
 But no temptation has overtaken you, but such as is common to man.

218
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,880
 And the Scripture says, "And God is faithful.

219
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,160
 And with that temptation, he will provide the way of escape also,

220
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,160
 so that you might be able to endure it, but you might not even be bothered

221
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,280
 by sin that much."

222
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:54,120
 And I hope that this series quickens your heart and awakens your heart

223
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,080
 to the reality of sin.

224
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,160
 Let me just read you a few quotes that guys have shared about sin in the past.

225
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,360
 This is a guy who was a pastor hundreds of years ago.

226
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,600
 He said this, "First, we practice sin, right?

227
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,080
 We do it, and then we defend it.

228
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,120
 Then we sometimes even boast about our sin.

229
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,280
 Sin's our first burden.

230
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,200
 It's then our custom.

231
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,440
 It's then our delight.

232
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,760
 And then it becomes our excellency."

233
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,480
 That's kind of what identifies us.

234
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,360
 What's interesting is when it starts to identify us, and some of you guys have

235
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,920
 committed or maybe are stuck or gripped by one of these sins, you're not controlled

236
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,600
 by the love of God, you think you're defined by your sin, the Bible just says

237
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,160
 that, "Listen, the enemy is going to always accuse you.

238
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,560
 You're a lust bucket.

239
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,120
 You're an immoral woman.

240
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,000
 You're a rage monster.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,640
 All you do is want, want, want.

242
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,480
 You're like a leech.

243
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,600
 Give, give, give.

244
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,960
 And the enemy who hates you, he always calls you by your sin."

245
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:02,480
 But the Bible says that God in His grace calls you by your name.

246
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,840
 And He just looks at you and He just, you know, in the Scriptures it says that God

247
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,640
 is the lifter of our head.

248
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,000
 I can tell you, I know just like from times that I was competing and playing

249
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,520
 sports, and whenever I would, you know, throw an interception or miss a key shot

250
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,960
 or not fulfill an assignment, it's just human nature to just kind of hang your

251
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,120
 head and just kind of put your head down.

252
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,760
 But the Scripture in Psalm 3 says that, "God, you're my glory and you're the

253
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,480
 lifter of my head.

254
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:42,240
 Satan is going to call you by your sin, but God calls you by your name."

255
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,840
 And He says, "Hey, Todd, I'm not going to define you by that last play or by that

256
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,120
 moment.

257
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,680
 I'm going to define you by the fact that I love you.

258
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,880
 I created you in my image.

259
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,960
 I want a relationship with you."

260
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:59,680
 Don't let sin be your burden, your custom, your delight, or your excellency.

261
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,400
 And this is just true of sin, isn't it?

262
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,600
 Right?

263
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,400
 This is what another guy said.

264
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,720
 He said, "The progression of sin is this.

265
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,520
 First, it startles us.

266
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,960
 Then it becomes pleasing.

267
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,240
 Then it's easy.

268
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,080
 Then it's delightful.

269
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,600
 Then it's frequent.

270
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,240
 Then habitual.

271
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,440
 Then a way of life.

272
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,400
 Then the man feels no guilt, then obstinate, then he resolves, never repent,

273
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,080
 and then he is damned.

274
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,280
 Sin will take you farther than you want to go.

275
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,120
 It'll keep you longer than you want to stay, and it will cost you more than you

276
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,280
 want to pay.

277
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,200
 But thanks be to God that He loves you.

278
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,400
 And when He looks at you, He sees a son or a daughter that has been held captive

279
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:52,640
 by someone who hates you, and He loves you, and He wants to set you free.

280
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,680
 If when you look in a mirror and you see somebody that you hate, and if you see

281
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,920
 somebody that's identified with a past action, you are listening to a liar,

282
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,040
 and you need to listen to what God's going to say to you tonight in the midst,

283
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,160
 maybe, of your sin.

284
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,320
 And He wants to call you home to Him.

285
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,360
 One of the reasons we're going to do this series is, like my friend Sam Alberry

286
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,600
 said, he said, "It's going to be much harder to physically resist a sin that

287
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,080
 you've been mentally rehearsing."

288
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,560
 And some of us do that, right?

289
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,880
 We, at first, are startled by the idea that we can do something, and then,

290
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,240
 as I said, it becomes pleasing and easy, then even delightful.

291
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,400
 And we start to rehearse it with images that we look at, or people that we run

292
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,960
 with, our playground and our playmates encourage it.

293
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,280
 And I pray that as a result of our time together tonight and our time in God's

294
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:58,440
 word, that you realize that sin is not your friend.

295
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,800
 Jesus is a friend, though, of sinners.

296
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,640
 Jesus doesn't hate sinners.

297
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,720
 He dies for them.

298
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,920
 And He loves you.

299
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,720
 God hates sin because He loves you.

300
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,200
 And this is a trustworthy statement, worthy of full acceptance,

301
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:28,720
 the scripture says, that Jesus Christ came in the world to save sinners.

302
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,920
 But you need to know this, until sin is bitter, Christ can't be sweet.

303
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,080
 So, you know, we looked everywhere today, it kind of hit me today,

304
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,400
 we looked everywhere today for a parachute, a real parachute,

305
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
 and apparently they're just not laying around, all right?

306
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,520
 And so we could not find a parachute for the life of me, so this is not a parachute,

307
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,280
 it's just a backpack, and it's stuffed with some clothes to kind

308
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,640
 of look like a parachute.

309
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,320
 But I want you to imagine this.

310
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,680
 I mean, I want you to be aware of who Jesus is, because what so often happens,

311
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,760
 because we don't talk about sin, we kind of make Jesus somebody that is,

312
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,080
 you know, that is just okay.

313
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,720
 Like, you know, Jesus will do.

314
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,880
 I guess I'm not going to go with Muhammad, I'm not going to go with Buddha,

315
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,360
 I'm not going to go with atheism.

316
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,440
 I'm going to go with Jesus.

317
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,120
 Jesus will do.

318
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,200
 Jesus is going to be my God.

319
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,280
 I'm okay with Jesus.

320
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,600
 And a lot of times what people even do is they tell you that Jesus is going

321
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,840
 to be a good buddy, he's going to make your life better, and so you want

322
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,120
 to follow Jesus, because if you follow Jesus, then you're going to become

323
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,440
 healthier, wealthier, or wiser.

324
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
 Now, can you imagine, all right, if tonight when you came in here,

325
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,280
 imagine that we're giving this talk while we're on an airplane, all right?

326
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,400
 And so we're flying along, and I just kind of come along and say,

327
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,760
 "Hey, would anybody like a parachute?

328
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,360
 It's going to make your flight better, okay?

329
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,800
 You'll enjoy it more.

330
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:55,280
 It'll just make the three and a half hours before we land across the country just

331
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,440
 kind of fly by.

332
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,480
 And so I want you, who would like a parachute?

333
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,960
 Because it's going to make our entire porch flight better."

334
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,040
 And so I asked just a little bit before we started for a volunteer,

335
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,560
 Steph goes, "Hey, I'm happy to wear this parachute."

336
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,440
 And so, "Steph, I want you to put on this parachute.

337
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,040
 Okay, you ready?

338
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,720
 There you go.

339
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,440
 Just slap that thing on.

340
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,040
 I want you to actually put it on, okay?

341
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,280
 And I want you to fly with us the rest of the message, okay?

342
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,320
 And sit down there, go ahead and put it on both shoulders.

343
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,040
 You got to put that parachute on right, and I want you to buckle, okay?

344
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,560
 You know, no one ever does this, but I want you to because I want that parachute

345
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,080
 that you're really going to enjoy.

346
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,640
 I want you just to enjoy your flight with us.

347
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
 So buckle there, the waist thing, and okay, you can go ahead and sit down and

348
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,920
 just enjoy your flight.

349
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,680
 And I'm glad I gave you that parachute, okay?

350
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,120
 How are you doing?

351
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,440
 Is that comfortable?

352
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,680
 I told you it was going to make your flight better.

353
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,440
 All right, well, you were volunteering, so there you go.

354
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:46,920
 You got it.

355
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,080
 Just hang in there with me.

356
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,720
 But let me just tell you what has happened, you know, in our world.

357
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:05,880
 Our world, because it has bought a lie, it doesn't see sin as deadly.

358
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,560
 In fact, we have gotten to where just like in that little progression that I talked

359
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:16,000
 to you about, we feel no guilt, we see no need to repent, we make sin our delight

360
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,640
 and our excellency.

361
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,840
 This is exactly what it says in Romans chapter 1, at the very end of the chapter

362
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,320
 where it says that because in verse 28 that they did not delight to acknowledge

363
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,080
 the goodness of God, this is what happened.

364
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,240
 They didn't see fit to acknowledge God any longer.

365
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,280
 This is Romans 1, 28.

366
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:43,280
 And so God gave them over to a depraved mind, a mind that doesn't work right,

367
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,960
 that starts to try and find life where there is no life.

368
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,040
 You see, that's one of the ways that God brings judgment to us, is he gives us what

369
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,120
 we keep asking for.

370
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,320
 God is not a rapist.

371
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,640
 He doesn't make you love him.

372
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,160
 He is glorious and good, and he gives you evidence that he is who he says

373
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,680
 he is, but he lets you choose.

374
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,800
 That's what love is.

375
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:15,640
 Love is a choice, and God shows you why we should choose him, but he says,

376
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,480
 "If you don't want me, you go your own way."

377
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,080
 And so it says that these men and women given over to a depraved mind,

378
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,560
 they do what's not proper for the human condition.

379
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,000
 They embrace what wages war against their soul, and so they're filled with all

380
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,840
 unrighteousness, and wickedness, and greed, and evil, full of envy,

381
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,960
 and murder, and strife, deceit, malice.

382
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,120
 They're gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful,

383
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,440
 inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding.

384
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,560
 They're untrustworthy.

385
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,360
 They're unloving.

386
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,080
 They're unmerciful.

387
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
 And even though they know the ordinance of God, and what Paul would do if he

388
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,960
 continued this argument in the book of Romans, is he would tell you that every

389
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,800
 man knows the beauty and goodness of God.

390
00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:00,680
 They see it in creation, and they see design, and they see beauty.

391
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,920
 They see man pollute it.

392
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,000
 They see man denigrate it.

393
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,240
 They see man abuse it.

394
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,920
 But they see the beauty of God in every sunrise, and every sunset,

395
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,600
 and in the splendor of the human body, and creation as God intended it,

396
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,720
 and yet we reject it.

397
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,800
 It also says that we see the standard of God, it's embedded in the heart

398
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,560
 of every single man.

399
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,960
 God doesn't need to give us a law.

400
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,120
 We have a law written in our hearts.

401
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,280
 It's called natural law.

402
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,080
 In every civilization on earth, there are people that go, "You know what?

403
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,000
 It's wrong to take another man's chicken."

404
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,040
 Even cannibals don't eat each other.

405
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,800
 They eat other tribes.

406
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,760
 And they go, "It'd be wrong for you to eat other members of our tribe."

407
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,800
 Now, it's fine if we do this to others, but for us, we don't do that.

408
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,440
 It's called natural law.

409
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,400
 But what happens is when we leave the law of God, and when we suppress even the

410
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,920
 conscience that God has given us within us, we end up being people who'd only

411
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,040
 practice these things that are worthy of death.

412
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:09,080
 But watch this, we give hearty approval to those who practice them.

413
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,280
 And people say all the time, "Hey, why would you want to put your law on me?

414
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,800
 Why do you want to tell me what's right and wrong?"

415
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,760
 And I'm here to tell you, I don't want to tell you what's right and wrong.

416
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,800
 I want to tell you that you're free to choose whatever you want to choose,

417
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,760
 but you're not free to choose your consequences.

418
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,320
 What I want to do is just take a little moment and just walk you through the

419
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:39,160
 story, and remind you who God is, who doesn't call you by your sin,

420
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,840
 but he calls you by your name.

421
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,160
 And he says, "Child, come home.

422
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,960
 Todd, I love you.

423
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,480
 And I don't want you to be without understanding, or untrustworthy,

424
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,680
 or unloving.

425
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:02,280
 I want you to know me and my grace."

426
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,960
 Every sin is deadly because it separates us from God.

427
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,760
 We already saw in Romans that God gave us over to a depraved mind,

428
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,920
 but that depraved mind is the mind that God gave us because the Bible says that

429
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,200
 there is a liar, right?

430
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,040
 So in 2 Corinthians 4, verses 3 and 4, this is what it says.

431
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,120
 When I share with you what I'm about to share with you,

432
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,720
 and one of the things I'm going to do in just a second is pray.

433
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,160
 And I'm going to ask you just to pray this simple prayer.

434
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,960
 You can just do it with me now.

435
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,800
 This is the prayer.

436
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,640
 God, if you're there and you're real, would you let me hear the words from the

437
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,200
 Bible tonight that tell me you do love me, that you don't see my sin,

438
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:46,880
 you see your son or your daughter who is depraved in mind and has been lied to and

439
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,240
 has believed a lie, and may your truth set me free.

440
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,760
 That's a simple prayer.

441
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,640
 Now, some of you need the ultimate truth that God is good and that God is love and

442
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,720
 God is kind and you need to embrace him as a savior.

443
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,320
 Others of you need to remember the goodness of God so you walk according to the

444
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,160
 righteousness that he intended for you to walk in.

445
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,520
 And you stop trifling with the sin that killed your savior.

446
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,200
 But just pray.

447
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,080
 Right now, eyes open.

448
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,160
 God, if you're there, you can handle my open eyes.

449
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,240
 Just give me a heart that wants to know what is true because I know that your word

450
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,480
 says there's a gospel that is veiled.

451
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,000
 The good news is veiled and it's veiled to those who are perishing.

452
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,280
 And then verse 4, "In whose case the God of this world has blinded the minds of the

453
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,880
 unbelieving so they may not see the light of the gospel of the glory of your savior,

454
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,680
 Jesus Christ, who was made in the image of God."

455
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,080
 And I'm going to end this message and I'm going to show you what Jesus did when he

456
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,000
 was on earth that's a picture of how God sees you.

457
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,880
 But let's go back to the very beginning.

458
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,760
 All right?

459
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,560
 And in the very beginning, we have the story of God who is the creator.

460
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:10,560
 Now, the reason that we start in Genesis with creation is because if he's the

461
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,040
 creator, then he knows what you were made for.

462
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,840
 And he knows how you should operate your life.

463
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,440
 He knows what's going to be waging war against you and your human experience,

464
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,360
 and he knows what's going to make your human experience delightful.

465
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,960
 And what he ultimately says is this, and you need to know that there is only

466
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,840
 really one sin that is deadly, just one.

467
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,400
 Biblically, there is one deadly sin.

468
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,760
 And that is the sin that says God is not good.

469
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,240
 It's the sin that says God's not necessary.

470
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,200
 It's the sin that says God isn't God.

471
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,040
 I don't need him for life.

472
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,280
 I don't need him for light.

473
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,640
 I don't need him for understanding.

474
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,120
 I don't need him for anything.

475
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,120
 I think God will do.

476
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,920
 If he'll make my life better, I'll chum up alongside of him.

477
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,560
 But he's not God.

478
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,160
 He's not ultimate.

479
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:15,240
 That's the only sin that is primary in the Scripture.

480
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,320
 It's a sin that, in effect, says God's not good, his word's not true,

481
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,920
 and disobeying him is not that big a deal.

482
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,240
 It's a sin that leads to death.

483
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,000
 The wages of sin is that we say, "I don't need you.

484
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,440
 You're not who I think you are.

485
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,920
 You're not who you say you are.

486
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,080
 You're, in effect, a liar.

487
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,280
 And so I will go somewhere else to find life."

488
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:42,080
 And the reason you never find life, ultimately, not just in the seven deadly

489
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:50,720
 sins, but in anything, is because God can't let you have what doesn't exist.

490
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,960
 Now, let me just show you what we've got here.

491
00:28:51,960 --> 00:29:01,920
 In Genesis 1, God the Creator, after he walks through this world that we have,

492
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,560
 and I will tell you that this world that we have is created because God is trying

493
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,160
 to reveal his glory.

494
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,800
 God didn't create man first.

495
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
 The angelic realm was created first.

496
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,680
 And even though the angels had been given everything necessary to enjoy God forever,

497
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,920
 there was a rebellion, the Scripture tells us, that amongst those angels,

498
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:28,840
 there was one that his job was, frankly, scholars believe, to reflect the glory

499
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,800
 of God because God was so glorious, even angels that were created

500
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,640
 to exist in his presence couldn't look directly on him.

501
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,960
 And so there was an angel that would reflect the glory of God,

502
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,600
 and then others would serve God and tend to him.

503
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,920
 And ultimately, that one angel, Lucifer, became convinced that they weren't

504
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:55,120
 attracted to the glory of God on him, they were attracted to him.

505
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,680
 And so he exalted himself above the other angels.

506
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,960
 Then he said, "We don't need God.

507
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,720
 Just follow me.

508
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,120
 I'll do you better than God."

509
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,520
 And it says that in the Scriptures that a third of the angels were swept away

510
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,160
 in that rebellion, and they were cast in the outer darkness.

511
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,880
 Now, when that happened, there was really no longer a discussion

512
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,880
 about who the most powerful being was.

513
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,800
 It was clearly God because there was judgment that was brought on those that

514
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,440
 said that they would be a better God than him.

515
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,960
 But the question remained, was he really right?

516
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,920
 I mean, I wonder if he could have done a better job.

517
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,880
 I mean, clearly, he can't take God on a cage match, but maybe he would have

518
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,760
 done a better job.

519
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,520
 I mean, I don't see anything really wrong, but maybe he would have done a better job.

520
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:55,280
 And God, in order to reveal more of his character, created beauty and form where

521
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,760
 there had previously only been a place of judgment and chaos and void.

522
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,960
 Now, he left that enemy, Satan, as prince of this new world, but in that new world,

523
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,920
 he made it Edenic.

524
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,960
 He made it perfect.

525
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,040
 It lacked nothing.

526
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,200
 And into that new world, we find in Genesis 1 that in the beginning of your Bible is not

527
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,480
 the in beginning of all of history.

528
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,320
 The in beginning of all of history is really found there in John 1, verse 1,

529
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,400
 where it says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,

530
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,440
 and the Word was God.

531
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,520
 And nothing came into being except through him."

532
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,400
 And if you go all the way back to Genesis 1, you're going to find out in the

533
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:34,160
 beginning of basically God's creation of man, he made man on the sixth day.

534
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,640
 And he made the earth that man was on glorious, and he put man in his image to

535
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,680
 rule over that world.

536
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,440
 And that world would be well when man walked with God, enjoyed God,

537
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,400
 and listened to God.

538
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,000
 But he warned man that there would be somebody there who would tell him,

539
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,160
 "You don't need God," just like the angels.

540
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,520
 So in Genesis 1, I'll just read it to you, verses 26 through 28, it says,

541
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,680
 "Then God said, 'Let us make man our image according to our likeness.

542
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
 Let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky,

543
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,880
 and over the cattle, over all the earth, over every creeping thing.

544
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,880
 You've got dominion, just like God has dominion over all of creation.

545
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,040
 We have dominion been given to us over the earth.' And so God created man in his

546
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,800
 image, and the image of God he created him.

547
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,320
 Male and female, he created them, and God blessed them."

548
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,600
 Now, notice the very first thing that God does with us.

549
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,960
 Before he gives us a single command, he just blesses us.

550
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,280
 "I love you. Here it is. God blessed them.

551
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,800
 And then he said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply others who are blessed.

552
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,080
 Fill the earth with others who are blessed. Subdue the earth.

553
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,320
 Rule over them, just like I rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky,

554
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,680
 and over every living thing that moves on the earth.

555
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,480
 I've given you everything,' he says, 'every plant yielding fruit that's on the

556
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,400
 seed and the surface of the earth, every tree which has fruit yielding seed,

557
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,760
 there shall be food for you. And all the beasts of the earth, they're yours.

558
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:56,320
 You're going to name them. You're going to live in peace with them.'"

559
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,160
 But we're going to find out that this is what he says, and the story specifically

560
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,880
 that he tells in Genesis 2, where he goes and expands.

561
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,200
 Genesis 2 is basically a commentary in Genesis 1, verses 26 through 31.

562
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,520
 In Genesis 2, verses 15 and 16, he says this to the man.

563
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:20,040
 He creates the man first, and he says to the man, "From any tree of the garden,

564
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:26,520
 you may eat freely. Take whatever you want. But from the tree of the knowledge of good

565
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,160
 and evil, you shall not eat. From the day that you eat from that tree,

566
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,040
 you shall surely die." Now, why was this there?

567
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,880
 Why did God put that stinking tree of good and evil there?

568
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:42,080
 Here's the reason why. Because God wants relationship.

569
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,040
 And you don't have relationship with people that are robots, that have no choice.

570
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,880
 All right? So God created perfect creatures.

571
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,840
 One of the things that perfect creatures have to be able to do is love,

572
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,040
 and you can't love if you don't have choice. So what God did is he created a world

573
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,200
 that was beautiful and perfect. There was no reason not to trust him.

574
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,920
 But in the midst of that, he says, "It's up to you whether you want

575
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,880
 to trust me or not. This is the tree of good and evil.

576
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,760
 And if you eat of it, you'll have the ability to discern between good and evil,

577
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,720
 but you don't need to. Just look at me. Is there any reason to believe

578
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,080
 that I'm not good? I've given you authority.

579
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,320
 I've given you, later, woman and man together, that you're naked

580
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,960
 and not ashamed. That's just a picture. Can you imagine?

581
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,200
 We can't even think about a world where we're naked and not ashamed,

582
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,160
 because we're so self-focused. Right? Or because when I look at you

583
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,320
 in your nudity, if I'm not self-focused, I'm you-focused.

584
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,840
 Like, how can I exploit you for my pleasure? But that wasn't the relationship

585
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,000
 that Adam and Eve had. They lived in innocence,

586
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,880
 enjoying one another, not exploiting each other, not self-conscious.

587
00:34:44,880 --> 00:35:00,440
 But just trust me, God said. You don't need to know what I know,

588
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,800
 because ultimately, you're not like me. Now, let me just say this to you real quick.

589
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,320
 We're adults here at The Porch, and so we all made mistakes this week, right?

590
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,760
 And most of the mistakes that we have made, we have not made

591
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:20,560
 because of ignorance. We have learned that certain behaviors socially are going

592
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,600
 to cost us friendships or are going to be a blessing to other people,

593
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,880
 and yet we made decisions to be petty and act in anger or to act in lust or to be

594
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,720
 greedy or any of the other deadly sins. And it wasn't an information problem,

595
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,080
 it was we know good and evil, but we're not intrinsically good.

596
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,320
 We're not God. And so even knowing good and evil,

597
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,280
 we don't choose good. We sometimes just flat-out choose evil.

598
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,560
 Can I get an amen? It wasn't a hearty one, but it was one like,

599
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,720
 "I guess you're kind of right." Look what God did. I want to show you

600
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:08,720
 something here. He just said, "I love you." And so this is Genesis 1 and 2.

601
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,640
 You have God, and there is peace between God and humanity.

602
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:21,560
 And we know that in God and humanity, there's male and there's female.

603
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:26,520
 And they have been given dominion over the world, and we know that part

604
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,680
 of the world includes the animal kingdom. And there is peace,

605
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:40,400
 and we all would love to hang out in Genesis 1 and 2. Now watch.

606
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,240
 We're going to get to Genesis 3. And before we get to Genesis 3,

607
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,440
 I want to just read to you from John 8, because this is what Jesus,

608
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,480
 when he was here, who was the visible image of the invisible God,

609
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:02,920
 who has come to pursue people who are sinners and who are held captive

610
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,880
 by the deceiving one, who told them, "You don't need to listen to God.

611
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,720
 God's not that good. His word's not that true. Just follow me,

612
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:20,160
 and you can be your own God." This is what Jesus says to the people

613
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,240
 that he came and spoke to in John 8. In verse 43, he says,

614
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,920
 "Why do you not understand what I'm saying?" When Jesus came, he says,

615
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,240
 "It's because you can't hear my word." Now, why can't we hear our word?

616
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,680
 Because our eyes...because we're veiled. We're dead in our trespasses and sins.

617
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,440
 Verse 44, he says, "Well, here's your problem. You are of your father,

618
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:48,040
 the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. That's your lineage.

619
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:53,080
 He was a murderer from the beginning. What I intended to live, he killed.

620
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,160
 And he doesn't stand the truth because the truth is not in him.

621
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,360
 There's no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his

622
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:06,000
 own nature. He is not like me. He is a liar, and he's the father of lives.

623
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,360
 And because I speak the truth, you don't believe me."

624
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:22,720
 This is the beauty that God intended. This is Eden.

625
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,520
 Now, in Genesis 3, let's just take a look at it together.

626
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:32,440
 Let's look at it very quickly. In Genesis 3, we've got the serpent.

627
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,720
 So, let's just come up here. He starts off, and so we've got the world

628
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,680
 is going to speak, which, you know, the created beings. Let's just go to the

629
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,720
 animal kingdom, right? Right here. That's where they are,

630
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:51,880
 animal kingdom. The serpent, okay? Right there. And it says, "To the woman."

631
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,640
 Has God really said you should not eat from any tree of the garden?

632
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
 "The woman said to the serpent, 'Well, from the fruit of the tree of the garden

633
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,880
 we can eat, but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden,

634
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,120
 God said you shall not eat it or touch it or you will die.'"

635
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,960
 Now, let me just make a quick comment right here. This is why you've got to study

636
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,680
 your Bible well and you want to go to a Bible-believing church.

637
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,920
 You want to go someplace that teaches the Word of God. Somebody doesn't add to it

638
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,240
 or take from it. You don't want to go to a church that doesn't talk about sin

639
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,120
 because it might upset you. Well, sin should upset you because it

640
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:25,880
 separates you from God and from one another. I think one of the very first sins

641
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:34,080
 that was ever committed was Adam was not careful with what he shared with Eve.

642
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,000
 I mean, you know, I can just see him saying to Eve in a sense because if we read

643
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,200
 the chronological story of creation in Genesis 2, God says to Adam, "Hey,

644
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,280
 don't eat of that tree or you'll die." And I can see him going and in effect

645
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,960
 saying, "Hey, listen, let's not even touch that tree because if you touch it,

646
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,000
 you'll die." So I don't know that for a fact. All I know is that somehow Eve either

647
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,920
 didn't remember or distorted it. I mean, she's innocent and so she said,

648
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,840
 "No, we can't eat of that tree and we can't even touch it." That's not what God said.

649
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,120
 There's an opportunity when you don't know the Word of God and you don't understand

650
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,360
 the Word of God or somebody can twist the Word of God, it's going to always create a

651
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:19,880
 problem for you. And this is what the liar did. He saw an opening.

652
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,640
 Indeed, as God said, "You should not eat of any tree of the garden," the woman said,

653
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,160
 "From the fruit of the tree of the garden we may eat, but from the fruit of the tree

654
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,480
 which is in the middle of the garden," God said, "You should not eat it or touch it

655
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,680
 or you will die." Opportunity. So the servant said to the woman,

656
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:37,120
 "Oh, you're not going to die. Watch." For God knows that the day you eat

657
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:45,280
 from it, here's God's problem. Look, I'm touching. I'm not dead.

658
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,200
 He says, "You should not eat from it or touch it or you will die." But God knows

659
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,320
 that when you eat from it, your eyes will be open. You'll be like God,

660
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,280
 knowing good and evil, and then He's going to be threatened by you.

661
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:04,320
 That's the pitch. God's not good. He doesn't have your best interest in mind.

662
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,800
 And so He tells the woman what to do. "When the woman saw," watch this,

663
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,840
 "that the tree was good for food, it was the light to the eyes,

664
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,920
 and it was desirable to make one wise." The lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh,

665
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,600
 and the boastful pride of life. That's that every single sin that we're going

666
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,920
 to talk about in the weeks ahead appeal to your eyes, your flesh,

667
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,000
 or your desire for more of you. Every sin falls under those three things.

668
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,720
 And you can either decide to follow God and what He says about how you should live,

669
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,120
 or you can just follow yourself in your own choice of what good is.

670
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,960
 But here's what happens in Genesis 3. We have the animal kingdom who tells

671
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,080
 humanity what they should do. Specifically, we've got the female being

672
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,920
 told and believing, who later goes to the male and says, "Hey,

673
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,880
 I took a bite of this thing. It was pretty good. You're not going

674
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,160
 to believe what I know." And so, man, who was with her when the

675
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,200
 whole thing went down and was silent. So, if the first sin was not the poor

676
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,000
 teaching of the male, it was certainly the silence of the male.

677
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,840
 The passive male who sat there and just went along with Eve as she followed her

678
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:28,080
 eyes and her flesh and her soul's desire to be a king.

679
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,840
 We see what it says right there in the scripture. It says in verse 6,

680
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,360
 "She took it from its fruit and ate, and she gave it to her husband who was

681
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,040
 with her, and he ate it." The eyes of both of them were open.

682
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,520
 They knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together to make

683
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,720
 themselves loin coverings because that's what man always does.

684
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,360
 He comes up with his own way to cover sin. The works of man will cover our sin.

685
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,040
 But now we've got the world, specifically the animal kingdom,

686
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,040
 telling humanity, specifically woman, who's going to tell male what to do.

687
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,600
 So, now they know what good and evil are. So, now they are going to tell God what's

688
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,280
 good and what's evil. And this is how we're going to deal with the fact that

689
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,280
 we're now naked and ashamed. Do you see anything unique about these

690
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:17,560
 two things? It's a complete inversion of what God said should be.

691
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,880
 Now, you need to know, this is Genesis 3, 1 through 8, and if you pick it up in

692
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:30,200
 Genesis 3, verses 9 through the end of the chapter, I think there's something like

693
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,440
 21-odd verses in Genesis 3, you're going to say, "God's going to...

694
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,920
 No, boys, I am God, but here's the thing. Now there is enmity between us because

695
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,120
 you no longer have a relationship with me. You don't have faith in me.

696
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,760
 You attributed to me that I wasn't good, that I wasn't glorious,

697
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,440
 that my way isn't right and true, that I didn't have your best interests

698
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,000
 in mind, and that is blasphemy, that is sin against me.

699
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,680
 And even worse, you try to cover up your nakedness with your own works,

700
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,320
 and that won't work because the wages of sin is death.

701
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,400
 And so, there's enmity now between God and humanity. And he says,

702
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,040
 "Here's the deal, humanity, you're going to have a problem because you know right

703
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,720
 away God says to Adam, 'Adam, where are you?'" Now, it wasn't because Adam was

704
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,680
 really good at hide and seek. What God is saying to Adam is what he's

705
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,280
 saying to you tonight. Listen to me. God's saying, "Hey, where are you

706
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,720
 in relationship to me? Where are you in relationship to sin?

707
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,800
 Adam, do you know what you've done?" You see, this is going to be the key

708
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,760
 for you being set free from your relationship with sin.

709
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,840
 And anybody who's in any kind of recovery ministry knows that the very first thing

710
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,880
 that you've got to do is you've got to admit that you've got a problem.

711
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:51,000
 And until you admit you've got a problem, there's no helping you.

712
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,120
 So, there's enmity between the man and the woman. Adam's over here and he says,

713
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,920
 "What happened?" He says, "Well, the woman you gave to me,

714
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,080
 she created this problem." So, now, we've got enmity between the man

715
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:09,000
 and the woman. And then, you're going to go on to see that there's now a conflict

716
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,400
 between man and woman and the world. And the man is going to have a consequence

717
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,600
 in his relationship with the world. The world's not going to bring forth fruit

718
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,560
 without toil. The woman's going to bring forth new life that's going to be a burden

719
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,000
 and a pain to her because your child's going to break your heart because just

720
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,880
 like you, my child decided to go your own way and it broke my heart.

721
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,880
 Can you relate to this? Have some of you guys broke your

722
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,960
 mama's heart with some of your choices? Did you grow up with a natural bent to say,

723
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:45,120
 "Yes, mother. Yes, father, as you wish." No, you go your own way and it's just

724
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:53,040
 heartbreaking. Some people believe that the reason women have pain in childbirth

725
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,040
 is because of Genesis 3. The pain is not the pain that came with the actual

726
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,880
 delivery of the baby, it was that the baby that was delivered is like mama,

727
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,360
 a sinner, and like daddy, a sinner. There's some people who even go so far

728
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,880
 as to say women should not have epidurals when they give birth because they're

729
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,280
 trying to mock God and reverse the curse. It's so interesting.

730
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,400
 None of those people that say that say that men shouldn't use John Deere tractors

731
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:26,280
 when they till the earth, right? Because the curse that was given the

732
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,000
 man was that now you're going to bring forth the fruit of the earth with toil

733
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,280
 and sweat on your brow. "Well, not if I sit there in an air-conditioned

734
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,080
 John Deere, I'm not." Right? And so let me just say,

735
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,840
 whatever's going on there in Genesis 3, it's not saying you can't get an epidural

736
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:48,680
 and it's not saying you can't drive a John Deere. It's a lot worse.

737
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,320
 Now, here's the beauty. You see this? God's saying, "Hey,

738
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,600
 you can't change what is. I'm sovereign. Humanity is underneath me,

739
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,840
 and male and female, that's just the way it's going to be.

740
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,520
 Men are stronger than women. They're not more glorious than women.

741
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,720
 They're not more valuable than women. But if men and women don't get along,

742
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,720
 women... You know, man is not going to live well without women,

743
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:16,600
 and women are not going to live well with abusive men. And this world is broken.

744
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:22,600
 And there is no peace. Now, real quickly, what you see right here

745
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,480
 in Genesis 3 is God showing his hand. He said, "Listen, if you guys want help,

746
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,480
 here's how you're going to get help. You're going to get rid of your fig

747
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,080
 leaves in your own effort to deal with your own sin, and you're going to take my

748
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,520
 sacrifice for you." So what did God give Adam and Eve?

749
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,200
 And we see the answer right here in verse 21. It says, "For the Lord God made garments

750
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,760
 of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them." Here's my question.

751
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,800
 Where did he get the skin? Did he go down to the local tannery?

752
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,840
 Because up to this moment, there was no death. He got the skin from an innocent

753
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:56,160
 animal that was there in Eden doing nothing but hanging out while, you know,

754
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:02,280
 Eve went over there and plucked an apple, took a bite of it, and then all hell

755
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:08,440
 literally broke loose. And now Fluffy the lamb is over here grazing,

756
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,920
 and God takes Fluffy, and I think it was a lamb. I can't prove it.

757
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,840
 I'm just going to say that God, the master teacher, always uses object lessons.

758
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:25,200
 And I think it was a lamb that was slain. And innocent blood was shed,

759
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,720
 and it covered the nakedness of Adam and Eve if they received God's provision

760
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:35,680
 for their sin. From that point forward, God begins to reveal more of his mercy

761
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,280
 and more of his nature. We see that God has said what's going

762
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,960
 to happen is that there's going to be a war, and you're going to see that the seed

763
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,360
 of the woman is going to come forth, and eventually it will crush the serpent,

764
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,600
 which is representative of rebellion. And you're going to see that the seed

765
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,840
 of the woman is going to be bit in the heel. In other words, it's going to be

766
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,600
 struck for a moment, maybe taken down, but it's going to not be mortal.

767
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,720
 But the wound to the enemy is going to be mortal, that God's going to accomplish his

768
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,120
 goodness and his grace. And God now begins to show not just that he's powerful,

769
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:12,240
 but that he's good and merciful and kind and gracious and glorious.

770
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,440
 Let me do this for you very quickly, because when you get to your New Testament,

771
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,040
 there's going to be something that happens called the cross of Jesus Christ.

772
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,120
 It's going to be called the Lamb of God who comes to take away the sins of the world.

773
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:31,080
 And when you get to Ephesians 1, 2, and 3, you have the story of Christ coming

774
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,800
 into the world. Let me just read to you Ephesians 2.

775
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,360
 This is Ephesians 2, verses 1 through 10. Watch this.

776
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:43,120
 "You were dead in your trespasses and sins," just like Adam and Eve,

777
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,520
 "in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world,

778
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,240
 according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working

779
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,520
 the sons of disobedience. Among them, too, we all formerly walked."

780
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,200
 I did, you did. "According to the lust of the flesh,

781
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,320
 indulging the desires of the flesh and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath,

782
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:07,840
 even as the rest. But God, but God, being rich in mercy because of his great love

783
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,720
 with which he loved us." Watch this. Do you see who God is?

784
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,760
 He's a loving God. He's not just a just God. He's a loving God.

785
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,480
 "Even when we were dead in our trespasses or our transgressions,

786
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,880
 he made us alive together with Christ. By grace we have been saved.

787
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,400
 There was a lamb that was innocent, that was slain, whose blood was shed,

788
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,440
 and we are covered." That word "covered" is a word that's called "atone."

789
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,560
 That's what "covered" means. You're atoned for. Your sin is covered

790
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,720
 by the blood of the lamb. That if you'll just go, when he says to you,

791
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,360
 "Where are you, lust bucket? Where are you, angry man? Where are you, envious one?

792
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:52,240
 Where are you, immoral woman?" I'm lost in my immorality.

793
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:57,960
 And he says, "You're my child. Will you come? Will you acknowledge that you're there

794
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,320
 where you don't belong? And will you come to me because I've made provision for you,

795
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,680
 not with just a lamb in the garden, but with a lamb on a cross?"

796
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:10,400
 Who he showed was who he said he was because he raised him, verse 6 says,

797
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,080
 "And seated him in the heavenly places, Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come,

798
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,880
 we would come to know the surpassing riches that are available in the kindness

799
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,360
 and the grace of God toward us through Christ Jesus."

800
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:27,920
 This is the gospel that is veiled to those of you who don't understand.

801
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:34,360
 It is by grace you are saved through faith. And even your faith is not of yourself

802
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,120
 because you're dead. God gives you the gift of belief.

803
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,400
 Some of you tonight are going to believe, "God, I believe. I'm stuck in my trespass.

804
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,840
 I believe that you have sacrificed your son that I can be reconciled to you."

805
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:51,280
 That faith itself is a gift of God, not as a result of your work so that no man

806
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,600
 should boast because this is about the glory of God, which is what he's revealing

807
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,320
 because the more you see the glory of God, the more you're going to love him.

808
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,360
 And the more you love him, the more you'll appreciate him.

809
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,400
 Here's the thing, till sin is bitter, Christ can't be sweet.

810
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,960
 "Stephanie, how are you doing? Are you comfortable out there?

811
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,320
 You look like you're leaning forward a little bit.

812
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,120
 But I told you it was going to make your porch experience better."

813
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:18,280
 No, I didn't give that to you on this plane, Stephanie, and I offered one to all of you

814
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,960
 in my little metaphor and my analogy because it was going to make your flight

815
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,600
 more comfortable. It's because this plane has gone down. It's going to wreck.

816
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,320
 There's never been a plane that's taken off a human life that hasn't gone down.

817
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,760
 And if you put on Christ because he's going to make your dating life better,

818
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,680
 he's going to make your business grow, he's going to make sure you never get cancer,

819
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,240
 you're not paying attention. That's not who Jesus is.

820
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:42,280
 He is the savior of the judgment that is due you. And your plane has gone down,

821
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,360
 and you're going to die. The statistics for death are rather impressive.

822
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:52,080
 For every single person born, that person dies because the wages of our sin is death.

823
00:52:52,080 --> 00:53:00,120
 And God, in his grace, is letting us sometimes live a thousand little deaths

824
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:07,440
 with our conviction of hatred of life, our despair, our despairing, our depression,

825
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,520
 our never being satisfied with other things. It's a gift from God.

826
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,120
 He whispers to us in our pleasures, "But God is shouting to you in your pain.

827
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,680
 This is not the world I intended for you. This is not the soul I wanted you to have.

828
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,920
 That's not the father I wanted you to have. That's the father of lies.

829
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,680
 I'm the father of light, and I'm not just glorious and powerful.

830
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:29,800
 I'm good and kind. I'm merciful, and I want you to love me."

831
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,520
 You see, what God's doing is before the angelic realm, as he's showing,

832
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,680
 they're looking at him and go, "Those people that had perfection and left you

833
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,840
 just like us, you're redeeming them? You're letting them live in the consequence

834
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,080
 of that, but you yourself are going to go to earth and die for them?"

835
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,640
 And that's why when you get, by the way, through Ephesians 1, 2, and 3,

836
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,800
 where the gospel is brought forward, and you get to chapter 4, he then says,

837
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,600
 "Now, how shall we live?" And when you get to Ephesians 5 specifically,

838
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,920
 he says, "Listen, now that your lives have been changed by the gospel,

839
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,280
 guess what else can change?" So when you get to Ephesians 5,

840
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,560
 watch what this looks like. You have God on the throne who died

841
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:14,680
 on the cross, and now there is peace again with humanity who trusts in him.

842
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:19,320
 And you have male who loves now, as Christ loves the church and gives himself

843
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,920
 to the woman, who lives with him in a way where he does nothing from selfishness

844
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,240
 or empty conceit, but with humility of mind, considers others as more important

845
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,120
 than himself. And so she delights in submitting to him. He uses his strength

846
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,480
 to protect her, provide for her, and she loves him with a never-ending love.

847
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,800
 And in the picture of her response to a sacrificial leader, the two of them are a

848
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,640
 picture of how we respond to God. There is peace between God and man,

849
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,640
 and so man has made new, so man can now have peace with woman,

850
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,080
 and woman can have peace with man. There is no enmity anymore between us.

851
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:54,960
 It's why when we get to Ephesians 5, verse 31, it says, "For this reason,

852
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,600
 in a Christian relationship, a man will leave his mother and father,

853
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,200
 shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."

854
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,080
 What's so important about that verse? It's a direct quote from, guess where?

855
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:16,080
 From Genesis 2. Do you see this? God, through the cross, has restored a taste

856
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,880
 of glory. If we'll trust in him, man and women can live in peace.

857
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,040
 This is why, poorest crowd, listen to me, you don't want to marry somebody that is

858
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:30,080
 still living underneath the deceiver, the liar, who says, "You're there

859
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:35,000
 for a sexual pleasure. You're there as long as it's useful to him.

860
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,880
 You're there until he beats you up so much, even through your battered wife syndrome,

861
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:45,040
 you can't stand it anymore. Don't marry that guy. You marry somebody

862
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,320
 who knows the goodness and the glory of God, who has himself been forgiven,

863
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,240
 who has received grace, so he can be a forgiver and a gracer,

864
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:55,560
 somebody who's been served by a sovereign, so he can serve you, and you respond to him

865
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:02,240
 in love, and the two of you can be one as God intended for us to be.

866
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,960
 But here's the deal. You get to Ephesians, and there's still a war between us

867
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,080
 and this world. The prince of this world is still in this world, and he hates us.

868
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:15,840
 And so watch this. So right after he says Christian marriage is this amazing thing,

869
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,440
 he gets in Ephesians 6 to this. He says, "Be strong, though,

870
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,880
 in the grace of the Lord and in his might. Put on the full armor of God,

871
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,840
 so that you might be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil,

872
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:34,000
 for our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the spiritual forces

873
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,480
 of wickedness in the heavenly places." And so put on the full armor of God,

874
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,200
 and you'll be able to resist the evil one who wants to lie to you again,

875
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,800
 that even though he died for you, you're still prone to wonder and go back

876
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:51,880
 to your foolishness and your sin. "Stand firm," he says in the gospel.

877
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,120
 I actually was doing this with a couple. I was doing premarital counseling once,

878
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,040
 and I just said, "Look, man, you're still at war." And I had a gal standing next to me,

879
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:04,080
 she goes, "Then why am I wearing white at a wedding? I ought to wear camo."

880
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:08,080
 And I go, "I dare you. That'd be awesome because you're right."

881
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:15,480
 You know why Satan hates Christian marriage so much? Because Christian marriage

882
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,600
 brings glory to God. It shows that two can be one and love one another and live

883
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,480
 selfless lives because it's a little shadow and a picture of the way that God

884
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,920
 has always lived. Because Christian marriage brings forth kids who can be taught

885
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,040
 the love of God, who they won't be perfect parents, but they're going to say,

886
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:37,120
 "Hey, we are not going to destroy this home and destroy one another and be abusive

887
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,240
 towards you because God's taught us how to live and how to love. And I want you to

888
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,920
 know this, God, if anything that's good in us is because we're paying attention

889
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,120
 to God. And so this is a home of peace. And we want you to know that the reason

890
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,160
 this home is different than others is not because we go to church,

891
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,760
 but because we follow the King of Kings and he's taught us the right way and the

892
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,800
 good way. And it's a blessing to you. Some of you guys have grown up in those

893
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,720
 homes. Not many of you have anymore. And God wants to change that.

894
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,200
 My daughter, who grew up in an imperfect home, but it was a Christian home with mom

895
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,400
 and dad that loved each other and that sought God's ways. My daughter says,

896
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:15,440
 "Hey, dad, here's my story. I've got more joy and less scars.

897
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,440
 And I need to trust in Jesus too or I'm going to be divisive and go my own way and

898
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:26,640
 leave the God-informed teaching of my parents. But I see the sin in me and I

899
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,280
 repent of it. And now there's generational faithfulness and blessing.

900
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:40,320
 And I watch them raising their children to know the goodness of God."

901
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,160
 Just close with this. This Jesus who came and died on a cross,

902
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,800
 the very first thing he did when he came to earth is he spoke this words,

903
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,120
 "Blessed are the poor in spirit." It's the same thing he said to Adam.

904
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:57,520
 "Adam, where are you?" And if Adam said, "I'm doing just fine over here in my sin,"

905
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,920
 then God would have left him there, but he just said, "I'm here and I'm naked.

906
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:14,080
 I'm vulnerable. I'm scared." Jesus said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit."

907
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,800
 First words out of his mouth. Can I just say this to you?

908
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:23,000
 God's not looking to catch you in your sin. He's looking to set you free from the sin

909
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,600
 that captured you and set you free and give you grace and restore you back

910
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,920
 in a relationship with him so you can be a picture of the glory that is to come

911
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,560
 because there's going to be a day he comes to judge the world.

912
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,200
 And he's going to bring judgment to the world right now by the way that you're not

913
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,200
 of the world and you're light in the world. And so the darkness is being exposed

914
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,960
 by the light with which you live. You're not like other young adults.

915
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:51,360
 You're not lust buckets, materialistic, selfish people.

916
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:59,440
 You're learning the ways of Jesus. And this is what Jesus did the first time

917
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,840
 that he shows up. He runs in. The very first miracle that he commits

918
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:12,440
 in Matthew is with a leper. Now, a leper is somebody who is a picture

919
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,720
 of a sinner. It's somebody who's dying from the inside out.

920
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,520
 It's a nerve disease that's inside, it's underneath the skin that eventually makes

921
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,600
 its way out to where everybody can see it. Lepers were cut off from society.

922
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:28,040
 They had no relationship with anybody's sin. The very first casualty of every sin

923
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,600
 is always relationship. And a leper was completely cut off.

924
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:39,440
 And when Jesus came down, it says, from giving the sermon on the mount,

925
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,480
 this sinner who heard the words, "Blessed are the poor in spirit,"

926
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:50,160
 he said, "I'm poor in spirit. Lord, if you're willing, you can make me clean."

927
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:56,240
 And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said, "I'm willing."

928
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,920
 And immediately, the grace of God went to work in his life.

929
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,240
 And immediately, the grace of God can go to work in your life.

930
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,480
 You're going to see that God's moving towards you in this message.

931
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,080
 He moved towards lepers. He moves towards us not to judge us,

932
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:23,680
 but to heal us. There is more mercy in Christ than there is sin in us.

933
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:31,000
 But where are you? Are you okay? Is sin still your friend?

934
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,760
 Or are you sick and tired of being sick and tired? Being cut off,

935
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:43,120
 hoping that the next thing will satisfy you even though you know it won't.

936
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,760
 It's taken you further than you wanted to go. It's cost you more than you wanted

937
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:54,960
 to pay, and you can't believe you're still there. But he's willing.

938
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:00,920
 You just have to come. And he wants to make the world right again,

939
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,760
 and you're still going to be at war. It's not easy, Christian.

940
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:10,600
 He's not here to make your life more comfortable. He's here to save you.

941
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:17,680
 Hey, Stephanie, if this plane was going down, aren't you glad you took what I

942
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,160
 offered you, but not because it made your life more comfortable?

943
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,640
 You're like an alien and a stranger in this group. But you know what?

944
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,400
 When the plane starts to rattle and go down, everybody else is freaking out,

945
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:32,360
 and there's peace in you. So you need to lose the lie that Jesus is

946
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:37,120
 here to just do. He isn't just here to do. He's not going to make things easier.

947
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,400
 He's here because he has done for you what you could never do from yourself.

948
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:48,480
 And he will never be sweet until sin is bitter. And I'm praying that you get sick

949
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,880
 of sin, and I'm praying that you might even have the wisdom not to have to drink

950
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:57,440
 deeply of it, but you'll just walk in the goodness of God.

951
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,920
 Father, I pray in the weeks ahead as we talk about these seven expressions

952
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:09,640
 of rebellion, and Lord knows we've tasted them all at some level,

953
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,560
 that we would be reminded again that on the way of these things,

954
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:17,240
 that there isn't life in any form or fashion, but there's only life in you.

955
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:22,120
 And so, Father, we trust in you. We come to you, and I pray there's somebody

956
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,400
 out there tonight that just like that leper, just says, "Lord,

957
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,480
 if you're willing, I believe you can forgive me." I look and I see leprosy,

958
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:33,880
 I see brokenness, I see hopelessness, but Father, I also listened to your word

959
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:39,320
 declared tonight, and I see you, the Lamb of God, who has come to take away the sins

960
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:44,200
 of the world. And I let go of religion. I let go of the fig leaves of human works.

961
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,360
 And I said, "You've got to clothe me in an innocent one that's shed because

962
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:54,840
 of my sin." And so, Lord, in poor in spirit, I come to you and I confess my sin.

963
01:03:54,840 --> 01:04:03,200
 I believe in my heart, Lord, that Jesus is Lord and that you raised him

964
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:09,960
 from the dead. And I confess with my mouth that he is Lord, and I thank you that that

965
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,600
 results in righteousness, and I believe in my heart that you raised him from the dead,

966
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:19,120
 and that results in salvation. And then, Lord, I want to walk with you.

967
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:24,280
 I no longer have to listen to this liar who told me your word's not true

968
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:29,080
 and disobeying it is not that big a deal, that you're not good, but I see your goodness,

969
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:35,040
 that you ran to me in my sin, and you love me, and you restore what my sin has lost.

970
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,560
 Oh, Father, teach me your ways. Let me run with your people.

971
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:43,320
 Let us sing your songs. Let us be light in the midst of darkness that others can see

972
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:50,040
 the goodness of our Savior. Thank you for the sweetness of your mercy and the goodness

973
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:57,040
 of your way. Let us sing and let us live in the goodness of God.

974
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:07,040
