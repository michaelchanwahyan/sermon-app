00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:28,640
 >> Porch, how we doing? You doing all right? Hey, it's great to be back. It's great to see you.

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,960
 So glad you're here. Thanks for making the time to join us this evening. Not just those of you that

4
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,200
 are here in the room, though, it's so good to be with you. A special shout out to Porch Live

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,280
 and all of our locations that are tuning in, especially Porch Live Springfield,

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,600
 Porch Live Des Moines, and Porch Live Fresno. Can we give it up for Porch Live, everybody?

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,160
 It's great to be together. Hey, well, just two weeks ago today, my life got flipped upside down

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,200
 because on November 5th at 2.06 p.m., coming in at eight pounds and eight ounces, mine and

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,840
 Brooke Perry's very firstborn son, Cass Levi Perry, came into the world.

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:14,480
 Text over stripes, am I right? The guy looks good. It's so on brand that we would have a Tuesday baby

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,480
 that he would show up, and I'm so grateful to TA that he would be a pinch hitter for me. He would

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,160
 show up and he would bless our room. Now, I don't know if you've ever been on the fence about raising

13
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,080
 kids, but take it from somebody that's been at it for two weeks. I recommend it. I recommend it. I

14
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,840
 think it's certainly worth the commitment should the day ever come that you can do so. And I say

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,880
 that as somebody that's not ever been one that's totally infatuated with the idea of having a whole

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,520
 household full of kids. Like, I'm not the guy that thought, "Man, I can't wait to have a harem full

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,720
 of kids." Like, that's not what I was looking for. I knew I wanted to have a big family, came from a

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:04,000
 big family, and yet I knew what it would cost me to have a son. Like, I was under no presupposition

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,600
 that it would not cost me something. I knew that I was going to be giving up an immense amount of

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,360
 sleep. I knew that we'd be spending a lot of money on all the latest baby gear. And I also knew that

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:23,520
 I would be just piled up with pounds of dirty diapers. I knew it would cost me a lot. And what

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,160
 I also knew is that this little guy wasn't going to contribute anything to our house. Like, he

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,160
 wasn't going to offer to pay the bills. He wasn't going to offer to pick up around the place. I knew

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,800
 that he wasn't going to agree to try and clean up his own mess. Instead, he was going to rely upon

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,400
 us to do that. In fact, he really hasn't been pulling his weight at all to this point. And yet,

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,960
 despite knowing all of this beforehand and realizing it every single day since,

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:55,520
 I'm totally enchanted with the kid. Like, I love him. Like, I'm mesmerized by the fact that he's

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:02,080
 mine and he's Brooks, that he is made in our image, that he is from God for us. Like, I'm blown away

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,760
 by the fact that he is my child. Like, I didn't realize just how wonderful it would be, just how

30
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,800
 captivated I'd feel, just how mesmerized I would find myself sitting on the couch and just looking

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,840
 at him and just staring at him, just waiting for him to do the next thing. And yet, that has been

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,320
 my reality. Like, I am nonetheless totally enchanted with this kid. I am wholeheartedly,

33
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,720
 totally, undeniably in love with the little guy. Now, what's happened to me over the course of the

34
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:43,840
 last two weeks is I've had a revelation that the way I love my son, it's an accurate reflection of

35
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:52,000
 how we should love Jesus. Like, we should be totally enchanted with him. Like, absolutely

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,520
 mesmerized, like captivated, gripped, arrested by the fact that you're mine. Like, I get to have you

37
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:11,040
 forever. And yet, what happens is we realize what it costs us. And now it doesn't pound up in piles

38
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,760
 of dirty diapers, but it does look like inconveniences in life, troubles that may be ahead,

39
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,280
 some cost will incur in the eyes of other people as we walk with Jesus. And what happens along the

40
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,160
 way is our enchantment is replaced with disenchantment. It becomes disillusionment.

41
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,960
 It even becomes discouragement to walk with him any longer.

42
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:43,600
 It shouldn't feel that way. Like, that's what's hit me over the last two weeks. Like, I realized

43
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,520
 if all of this is true, like if Jesus really is wonderfully enchanting and he is totally

44
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,800
 mesmerizing and he captivates the hearts of any and every person because he is God, it doesn't

45
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,640
 make sense then that I would ever fall out of love with him. And yet, if we can be honest with

46
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,920
 ourselves, if you can look yourself in the eye tonight, you might find yourself in the spot where

47
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,160
 this is in fact true for you. Like, you may know that, man, I was totally enamored with him at

48
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,520
 first. I couldn't get enough of him. I wanted to spend time with him. I wanted to sit and learn as

49
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,720
 much as I could. I wanted to soak in the scriptures because it was the way that I was getting to

50
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,760
 understand who he was and I was learning who I now am. And yet, somewhere along the way,

51
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:38,400
 you fell off. You lost your love. Your excitement fell flat. Your passion burnt out and your

52
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:46,720
 affections ran dry. What do you do when that's the case? Well, that's the question that I want

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,440
 to answer tonight. What do we do when we find ourselves totally disenchanted with the person

54
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,920
 of Jesus? And to answer it, what I want us to do is look at the book of Revelation. So, if you have

55
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,120
 a Bible, you can turn with me to Revelation chapter 2. Revelation is the last book in your Bible, so

56
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,480
 it's easy to find. If you don't have a copy of the scripture, don't worry. We'll have it on the

57
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,840
 screens behind me. We've been in a series called Disciple, where we've been looking at what it

58
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,280
 means to very simply walk with Jesus. And that idea is one that many of us hear and we kind of

59
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,120
 tune our ears out. We turn our brains off because we think we know what it means to walk with him.

60
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,880
 And yet, what we've been challenging you is that this idea that to be a true disciple of Jesus is

61
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,480
 not just to know about the guy, it's to know him personally. And we've been looking at it through

62
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,560
 the eyes of the guys that knew him best, that walked with him nearest, those disciples, which

63
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,520
 we read their stories in the gospel accounts. And yet, tonight, what I wanted to do as I came back

64
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,760
 is I actually wanted to break the script. Like, I wanted to pause our regularly scheduled programming.

65
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,120
 I wanted to make an exception to our rule of being in this series because I wanted to tackle an idea

66
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,080
 that as I've sat with you over the last several months, many of you just in one-on-one coffees,

67
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,800
 like out in this coffee shop, spending time together and learning your story, what I realized

68
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:12,640
 is across this room, we have a big problem. I've been trying to talk to you about what it means to

69
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,240
 walk with Jesus. And yet, so many of us are convinced that we're walking with Christ.

70
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:28,720
 When in reality, we are just wandering about in the Christian life. Like, we're not moving with

71
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,440
 any kind of conviction. Instead, we're just meandering along in comfort because we know the

72
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,520
 right things to do. We know the right things to say. We know the right places to go. We know the

73
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,240
 right people to spend time with. And yet, we do all of these right things for all of the wrong reasons.

74
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,200
 And so, I wanted to take an evening to just challenge this idea and help us get on the

75
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:03,680
 same page of what it means to walk with Jesus rightly. And so, looking at verse 1,

76
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,680
 the right reason for walking with Jesus, we see it says this,

77
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:16,240
 "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write, 'The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right

78
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,240
 hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.'" Now, what you need to know is that Jesus is speaking

79
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,440
 to the apostle John, and John is receiving a revelation, a vision from God for us. And what we

80
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,760
 know is that it's speaking specifically to the church at Ephesus in this moment. And so, what we

81
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,360
 should do is we should be good Bible students, and we should ask, "What do we know about Ephesus?"

82
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,720
 Well, a couple things that you should know about the place of Ephesus. Ephesus was the capital city

83
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,720
 of Asia Minor. It was socially advantageous to live there. It was an incredibly wealthy city,

84
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,200
 and it was politically strategic if you were a person of power. Like, it attracted the likes of

85
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,600
 anybody that was somebody. People like Alexander the Great, and Julius Caesar, and Cleopatra,

86
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,640
 and Mark Antony, they all made stops in Ephesus. It was like New York, right? Anybody that somebody

87
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,040
 lives there, if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. And yet, what we know is it

88
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,480
 wasn't just an attractive spot for the rest of the world, it was also an attractive spot for

89
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,600
 Christians to go. Some of the most significant believers that we know of actually made their

90
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,400
 way through Ephesus. People like Paul, and Timothy, and John, Priscilla, Aquila, Tychicus,

91
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,400
 Apollos, all of them made their way through the church at Ephesus at some point. And I don't know

92
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,880
 about you, or who you podcast on Sundays, because the guy preaching up here may not be the guy that

93
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,760
 you want to listen to at different points, but what you need to know is that you don't need to

94
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,760
 podcast anybody else, because this is an NBA super team of talent. Like, their preaching rotation is

95
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,520
 stacked, because these people are unlike anybody else. These names may not mean much to you, and

96
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:01,760
 yet what you know is that the 27 books in the New Testament, 19 of them were pinned in some degree by

97
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,080
 these names in specific. Like, 19, 70% of your New Testament came from these people that taught at the

98
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,520
 church at Ephesus in some time. Like, this church had an embarrassment of riches when it came to

99
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,120
 spiritual influence. And the results, they corresponded accordingly. Like, we read it in

100
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,080
 verse 2 and 3. It says, "I know your works, your toil, your patient endurance, how you cannot bear

101
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,400
 with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found

102
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,640
 them to be false. I know you are enduring patiently, and you're bearing up for my namesake,

103
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,440
 and you have not grown weary." Like, can we just call it like it is? The Christians in Ephesus

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,960
 are better Christians than all of us. Like, what Jesus just said is he gave nine commendations,

105
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:54,160
 descriptors that approved of their religious zeal. Like, just how awesome they were,

106
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,960
 outwardly speaking. He says, "Hey, I know your works, your toil, patient endurance, you can't

107
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,240
 bear with those who are evil, tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, you found

108
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,960
 them to be false. I know you're also enduring patiently, bearing up for my namesake, and you've

109
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:11,760
 not grown weary." Like, these people are so zealous for the things of God to live the Christian life

110
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,600
 that if they were here in our modern time, like, they would literally, at five o'clock in the middle

111
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,800
 of rush hour, hop in their car, gas it up, and get out in the midst of traffic just so they could

112
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,160
 encourage people at the most heinous time of day. Like, that's how zealous they were for the

113
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,800
 goodness of God. They were zealous to live this life that God had called them to live. They're

114
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,840
 genuinely, hands down, more impressive than any one of us. And yet, the next thing that Jesus says

115
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:47,280
 is pretty alarming, because he says in verse four, "But I have this against you, despite all of that,

116
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,680
 you've abandoned the love you had at first."

117
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,920
 So let's just make sure we have this straight. Here we have a group of successful,

118
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:05,920
 persevering, theologically interested, and resilient believers who, in the eyes of the world,

119
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,680
 are the type of people that Jesus should be most proud of. Like, they're radically counter-cultural,

120
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:20,720
 they're obedient to the word, and yet Jesus just said, "Hey, I observe all of your outward obedience."

121
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,080
 And yet, when I cut straight to the inward heart, what I see is someone that,

122
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,360
 you may do all of the right things, but you do them for all of the wrong reasons.

123
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,720
 Like, there's not a white hot flame of affection for me. Instead, all you have is a cold sense of

124
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,200
 duty and doctrine. They looked the part. Like, they sang the songs, and they prayed the prayers,

125
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,040
 and they answered the questions, and they showed up on Tuesday nights, and they made sure to take

126
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,800
 down good notes, and make sure to take a picture to share with the rest of their followers on

127
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:01,760
 social media. They did all of the right things. They looked the part, but they had no heart.

128
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,200
 They abandoned their first love. That's what it says,

129
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:15,040
 which is an interesting way of describing what they did. They didn't forget their first love.

130
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,640
 They did not lose their first love. They didn't misplace their first love. They didn't lose that

131
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,640
 loving feeling at any given point in time. No, it says that they abandoned their first love.

132
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,840
 Like, this was a love that they did not lose. It's a love that they left. Are you tracking with me?

133
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:41,920
 Which begs the question, what did they do that led to that end? How did they fall out of love

134
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,760
 with God? Well, how do you fall out of love with anything? Well, one quick Google search,

135
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,560
 and you can read what psychologists would describe as being the primary reasons we fall out of love

136
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,600
 with anyone or anything. What do you see? You stop communicating. You have unrealistic expectations

137
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,600
 of the other person. You lack intimacy. You grow bored. You break trust. You even fall in love with

138
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,120
 someone else. I remember when I was 14 years old, me and some neighborhood buddies, we came up with

139
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,760
 this bright idea that we wanted to start a garage band. And so doing the only sensible thing, I

140
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,760
 decided I needed to buy a guitar because I wanted to be a part of the crew. And so I went and I bought

141
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:25,040
 a baby blue speckled Fender Stratocaster. And I love that thing. I love that guitar. Like, I love

142
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,280
 showing it to people, and I love talking about it with people, and I love the credibility it gave me

143
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,360
 amongst other people. The fact that I was in the band. And yet, if you asked me today,

144
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:45,520
 "Hey man, can you play the guitar?" I would say no. Why? Because though I outwardly loved

145
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:52,080
 that guitar, I inwardly did not love that guitar. Though I publicly loved that guitar, I privately

146
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,240
 did not love that guitar. Like, I would pull it out of the case, and I would take it,

147
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
 and I would show it, and I would talk about it. And yet, whenever I would go home,

148
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,560
 I'd put it on its stand. I'd push it to the corner. Much of the same way many of us

149
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,520
 take God and push him into some corner of our life until it is

150
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:25,680
 benefiting to pull him out and show him to those that are in our sphere of influence.

151
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:35,120
 You see, we don't want God. We want what God gives.

152
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:43,440
 And yet, it's not coincidental that in John 1:38, the very first question that Jesus ever

153
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,240
 asks the disciples is one that points straight to the heart of their affection. He asks them,

154
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:57,520
 "What do you want?" Not, "What do you know?" or "What do you need?" or "What do you believe?"

155
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,440
 "Where did you come from?" No, the first question Jesus ever asks his disciples is, "What

156
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:12,640
 do you want?" Because he knows whatever it is that you desire will ultimately drive your life.

157
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:25,680
 Like, what you want in life determines where you go in life. At least that's what Proverbs 4:23

158
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,440
 says. It says, "Above all else, guard your heart." Why? Because everything you do flows from it.

159
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
 Everything you do, it flows from your heart. Like, literally everything. There's no exception.

160
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,160
 What you want most determines what you want now. Like, what you want most determines what you want

161
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,840
 right now. Everything you do, everything you say, every place you go, every thought you think,

162
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:50,160
 everything you eat, it all points to the fact that you love whatever that is the most.

163
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:58,560
 So, when you look at your actions, how you spend your time, where it is you go, the words that you

164
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:09,520
 speak, what do those actions tell you about what you really, truly care about? Like, do you really

165
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,440
 care about your career? Like, you just want to have a seat at that table. You just want to ascend

166
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,680
 to that position. You just want to make it on Forbes 30 Under 30. Like, you're just trying to

167
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,240
 bank a million in this next year. Like, what is it for you? Is it your career? Maybe it's

168
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,880
 your relationship. Like, maybe it's spending time with that guy or that girl. Maybe it's the reason

169
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,960
 why you're willing to push physical boundaries, because what you really want is you want to be

170
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,000
 connected to that person, and you're willing to even bend the rules to make it happen. You're

171
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,280
 willing to compromise your purity to make it happen. Maybe it's not a relationship. Maybe it's

172
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,960
 an experience. Like, what you want is you know the days are numbered. I don't have long, Kylan,

173
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,960
 and so what I want is I want to live it up. I want to have a good time. I want to be happy in life.

174
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,280
 I want to make my days count. Maybe it's not experience. Maybe you just really care about

175
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,800
 what others think of you, so much so that you're willing to morally compromise, bend your integrity,

176
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,920
 even blur the lines between what's right and what's wrong just so people will think well of you.

177
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,400
 Maybe that's not the case. Maybe you care what people think of you so much that whenever you

178
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,640
 walk away from a conversation you had and you said something stupid or you did something dumb,

179
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,400
 you can't help but replay it over and over and over and over and over again, and all you do is

180
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,600
 beat yourself up over the fact that I can't believe I said that. That was so stupid. What do they

181
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,240
 think of me right now? You're riddled with social anxiety. Maybe you really care about Jesus,

182
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:50,400
 or you're just playing the Christian game. Like, do you say one thing but then do something else?

183
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,760
 Do you look the part when really you could care less?

184
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:10,080
 Friends, so many of us, we have an aptitude for God, but we do not have an appetite for God.

185
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,400
 Y'all tracking with me on that? We have an aptitude for God. We know

186
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,560
 this game is easy. It's not hard to be a Christian. Like, you just gotta be a good person.

187
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,880
 You just gotta do the right things. You just gotta say the right things. You gotta show up to the

188
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,120
 right places. Gotta spend time with the right people. Gotta make sure that you repent, you

189
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,240
 know? Like, it's not hard to play this game, and yet so many of us have, we have grown content with

190
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,760
 an aptitude for God, when in reality we need an appetite for God. Like, we have all the knowledge.

191
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,640
 We can handle ourselves in spiritual conversations. We can answer all of the questions, but we have

192
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,760
 lost the internal rumblings of wanting more of God for solely ourselves.

193
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,760
 We have no hunger pains for holiness. Like, seeing your friends and meeting other young adults and

194
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,240
 running into certain people here on Tuesday nights that you're really hoping you might

195
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:14,880
 bump into at some point, or serving even. Showing up on Sundays, singing the songs,

196
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,520
 enjoying the worship, taking notes down whenever the teaching's happening. Like,

197
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,280
 all of those are good things, but listen, they're not God things. They're not the best things.

198
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,680
 They're not the right thing. If you're showing up for those reasons and those reasons alone,

199
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,560
 then you want what God has to give, and you don't want God himself.

200
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:47,920
 So what do you do if this is you? Verse five tells us, "Remember therefore from where you've fallen,

201
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,720
 repent and do the works that you did at first. If not, I will come to you and I'll remove your

202
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,320
 lampstand from its place unless you repent." So how do you stir your affections for Jesus again?

203
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 If you find yourself at a place tonight where, man, you're not actually walking in the warmth

204
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,000
 of his company, but you've subscribed instead to cold orthodoxy or comfortable Christianity,

205
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,920
 how do you reignite the flame of faith? How do you get your affections burning again?

206
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:25,120
 He tells us, "You remember, you repent, and you return." You remember. Like, you remember what

207
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,520
 it was like when you first met Jesus, where you were, how that felt. Like, you're reminded of the

208
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,320
 joy of your salvation, and then you repent. You look at these things which led you away from God,

209
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,240
 which distanced you away from his company, and you turn them aside. You push them off,

210
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,920
 and you move back towards him. You return. You go back to doing those things which catalyzed

211
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,440
 your love for God and all the affection he deserves in the first place. You remember,

212
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,960
 return. You remember, repent, and return. What you don't do is you don't recognize regret and repeat.

213
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,440
 Like, notice it doesn't say that. Like, you don't recognize that, "Yeah, man, like, I'm further away

214
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
 from God than I actually want to be, but I don't know necessarily how to get back." And then you

215
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,680
 regret the fact that, "Man, I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have done that thing. I shouldn't have

216
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,000
 said those words. I shouldn't have heard that person." And then you, despite the fact that you

217
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,720
 know you shouldn't, you repeat it anyways. That's not what he's saying. He's not telling you to just

218
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,480
 recognize it's wrong, regret the fact that it happened, but then still repeat it. Come tomorrow,

219
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,120
 and then come the day following, and come the day thereafter. He's telling you to remember,

220
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,240
 return. Remember, repent, and return. And as I was prepping this, like, I know there's some of you

221
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,720
 here in the room, and you're like, "But, Kylan, like, it's too late. Like, I started off this

222
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,080
 year, and I had the best of intentions. Like, I really wanted it. Like, I wanted to walk with

223
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,680
 God this year. I wanted to give him my whole heart. I wanted to go all the way in. I wanted

224
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:05,920
 to push full tilt in my faith, and yet I did that thing, or I spent my time with that person, or I

225
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,600
 did that thing, and I can't take back. Like, I don't know what it is for you, and yet what you need to

226
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:20,240
 know is it's not too late. Your love may have run out, but your time has not run out. You can remember

227
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:28,720
 tonight. You can repent tonight, and you can return tonight. How do you do that? Well, we actually get

228
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,400
 a really good picture of what this looks like, some good handles to hold if we go back to the

229
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,480
 beginning of Ephesus. If we turn the page, if we rewind the tape, and we look at where they were

230
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,040
 before they abandoned their first love, and we see that in Acts chapter 19. You can turn there if you

231
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,760
 want. I'm going to have it on the screens, and I'll read it to you here, but what you need to know in

232
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,520
 Acts chapter 19, just for some background, is that Paul comes to the church in Ephesus, and he gives

233
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,520
 the Holy Spirit to some disciples he finds there, and what happens when he gives the Holy Spirit to

234
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,680
 these disciples is revival breaks out. Like, people start repenting of their sin. They commit their

235
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,480
 lives to Christ, and miracles are happening. Life for these people, it gets turned upside down,

236
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,880
 because that's what happens whenever you meet Jesus. Like, everything changes when you meet

237
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,640
 Jesus, and so we read this in Acts chapter 19, looking at verse 17, "And this became known to

238
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,520
 all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the

239
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,520
 Lord Jesus was extolled. Also, many of those who were believers, they came confessing and divulging

240
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,520
 their practices, and a number of those who had practiced magic arts, they brought their books

241
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,160
 together, and they burned them in the sight of all, and they counted the value of them, and they

242
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,320
 found it came to 50,000 pieces of silver." It's a lot of literature. "So the word of the Lord

243
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:52,080
 continued to increase and prevail mightily." So what can we learn from the life of these Ephesians

244
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,680
 at the beginning? Three things that correspond with remembering, repenting, and returning. The first

245
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,000
 is that if you want to remember, you've got to get focused on Jesus. That's the first point.

246
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,320
 If you want to remember, then you have to get focused on Jesus. If you're here, and the flame

247
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:19,440
 of faith has gone quietly dim in your life, you feel disenchanted with Jesus. You're not sure if

248
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,760
 this walk is really worth it. You feel like it might be too late. The first step you take

249
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:34,080
 on the road to remembrance is you get focused on Him. You get focused on Jesus. That's what it says

250
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,800
 in verse 17, that after seeing all that had been done in the name of Jesus, fear fell upon them all.

251
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,760
 Everyone who witnessed the power of God in the story, in the preceding verses, their response

252
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,880
 is they extolled Jesus as Lord. They look at Him, and they're like, "You're the God. You're the Lord.

253
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,400
 You're the master. You're the one in charge." That's their response. Now, we don't use the word

254
00:25:52,400 --> 00:26:00,000
 extoll a whole lot in modern English, but the idea of extoll is to worship or to praise or to celebrate.

255
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,880
 It's what you do whenever you go to a big game, and you're supporting a team that you really love,

256
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,760
 and they score. You go to a concert, and that song comes on. "Boy, I've been waiting for that song."

257
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,360
 What response do you have? You lift your hands. You get a little bit indignified. You start

258
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,960
 bouncing around. You start slapping hands. You start cheering with the people around. You start

259
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,480
 to celebrate because you are worshiping something that's worthy of your worship. That's what's

260
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,920
 happening right here. Like the Ephesians, they experience wonder and awe, and the response is

261
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:41,120
 revival breaks out. Psalm 22, 3, it says that, "Yet you, God, are holy, and you're enthroned on the praises of Israel."

262
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:51,040
 That word "enthroned," it means that God inhabits or he dwells in the praises of his people.

263
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,320
 That's what Israel is. It's the people of God, and what's so significant about that

264
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:04,080
 is the fact that when we praise God, guess what? He's here. He's present.

265
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,880
 Like, just let that sink in on you, that when we sing, here in just a minute,

266
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,920
 God delights to inhabit

267
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,480
 your song. He wants to be here with his people.

268
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,400
 Their response is one of radical reverence,

269
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,840
 and yet ours is so often a response of casual indifference.

270
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,440
 This song again, I've heard this one already. We sang this on Sunday,

271
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,120
 and what we do is we move through the motions,

272
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,600
 and raise our hands in the right moments, beat our fists because we don't want to just stand still.

273
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,400
 We look the part, but we've lost the heart,

274
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:00,800
 and yet what we see for these Ephesians is that at the appearance of God's presence and power,

275
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:09,200
 they realize just how big he is and how small they are, and we have to do the same thing.

276
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,840
 How do we do it? Well, you remember, every single day you get focused on Jesus.

277
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,480
 Every single day you think as often and as much of Jesus as possible.

278
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,880
 As often and as much of Jesus as possible. Like, you give him quantity of thought,

279
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,440
 and you give him quality of thought. In the same way, if you're trying to get good at anything,

280
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
 if you're trying to learn to hit a golf ball, if you're trying to learn how to shoot a basket,

281
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,200
 if you're trying to learn how to shoot a gun, whatever it is for you, what you have to do

282
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,400
 is you have to put up a lot of shots, a quantity of repetitions, but you have to make the reps count.

283
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,960
 You also have to add to them quality of effort. That's what we do. That's how we get focused on

284
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,000
 Jesus. That's how we remember who he is, and we take this first step. What does that actually look

285
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,760
 like? Well, it varies. It depends on the person. What stirs your affections? Like, when you gather

286
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,040
 in here on Tuesday nights, or when you come in on Sundays, or you're spending time with

287
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,200
 God in the mornings, or whatever it is for you, what actually leads you to love God more?

288
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:19,600
 Whatever that is, you should do it. A lot. And with great intentionality. Like, that's the idea.

289
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,800
 Like, what I know is that if you want to grow in your love for Jesus, what you're going to have to

290
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,080
 do as you spend time with him is you're going to have to do what you would do with anybody. If you

291
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,000
 want to spend time and grow a relationship, you're gonna have to listen to him, and you're gonna have

292
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,640
 to talk to him. What relationship thrives without communication? The way we communicate with Jesus

293
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,200
 is we read his word, because all of this communicates who he is from him to us, and

294
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,040
 then we pray back. Because when we pray, we're not just lifting up empty thoughts and words that

295
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:57,360
 bounce upon the ceiling. No, we're talking to God. We're communicating with Christ. You read the word

296
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:07,280
 every single day. You pray often, in private and in company. You get outside, and you marvel at the

297
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,720
 spectacle of God's creation. You find reason to be grateful, because our world gives us plenty of

298
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,680
 reason to complain. You enjoy good food, because it's from God. You spend time with good people

299
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,760
 in a way that leaves you feeling innocent by the end of it all. You do whatever it takes for you to

300
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:33,120
 love God more by the end of the day than you did at the beginning of it. You got that? That's how

301
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,960
 you remember. That's where you first start. You do whatever it takes. And here's what you got to know,

302
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:46,560
 man. God comes wherever he's wanted. Like, if you're showing up, and you're wanting for God,

303
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,040
 and you're pursuing him in a way that accords with his word and is obedient to his will,

304
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:58,720
 he'll come to you. Like, draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. God comes wherever it is

305
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,920
 he's wanted. So, if God feels far off, the question is not, "Where has he gone?" The question is,

306
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:13,920
 "Where have you gone?" That's the first point. Second point is in verse 18. It says, "Also,

307
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,880
 many of those who were believers, they came, confessing and divulging their practices."

308
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:25,120
 So, the second step to remembering your first love, to growing your affections for Christ,

309
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,240
 is you got to repent. And the way that you repent is you get honest about your sin.

310
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,600
 That's what we see here in verse 18. Like, that's how this works. Like, when you see Jesus for how

311
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,680
 perfect he is, you see yourself for how polluted you are. And the only natural thing to do in that

312
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,840
 moment, when you see how great he is and how wrong you are, is you repent. Like, that's what all

313
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,080
 revivals are forged upon. Like, that's the anvil upon which revivals are built. They're built upon

314
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,440
 repentance. Like, it doesn't start—like, a revival doesn't come to a city until it first comes to an

315
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,480
 individual. I think it's fascinating. I'll probably make some enemies for this. In our nation right

316
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,600
 now, people are so invigorated about the idea of revival. Like, they want a movement of God to just

317
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,880
 sweep over the nation. And I'm all for that. I think that's a great thing to desire. And yet,

318
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,160
 you cannot want for it to come to the nation before you want it to come to the person.

319
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:33,280
 It doesn't come to the masses. It comes to the one. National revival, it's birthed through

320
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:42,080
 personal renewal. Which is why we have to get honest about our sin. Like, personal renewal

321
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,880
 happens when we take a good, hard look inside of ourselves and we see, "Wait, what's wrong?"

322
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,840
 And we respond the same way they did. What we see from these Ephesians is they understand Jesus'

323
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,760
 willingness to forgive sins. And they're like, "What? What? Like, you're willing to forgive sins?

324
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,520
 Then, wait, wait. Here's everything I have. Here's all of my sin. If you're willing to forgive it,

325
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,480
 let me get it all out to you. Because I don't want any of it to go unforgiven. Like, I want all of it

326
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,800
 to be known. I want all of it to be—I want all of it to be covered. I want all of it to be washed.

327
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:23,120
 Jesus, this is everything I have. Let me tell you it all." Which is why it's so fascinating to me

328
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,520
 that we hide our sin from God and one another. Like, Jesus is wanting to forgive it. Like,

329
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,720
 he has the power to forgive sins, him and him alone. Like, he has the power to love the very

330
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,480
 worst version of you. And it's the very reason it came. Like, there is nothing in you that would

331
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,840
 ever turn him off, would ever turn him away, would ever lead him to say, "No, not you. You're

332
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,320
 the exception. Everybody else is great, but not you instead." No, like, your sin, it did not repel him.

333
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:01,040
 It compelled him. Like, it didn't push him off. It pulled him in. He saw where you were, and he's

334
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,480
 like, "I don't want that for my people. I'll do what it takes. I will swoop in and save the day.

335
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,080
 I will bear their sin. I will hang upon their cross. I will die their death, and I will rise

336
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:18,720
 from the grave for their sake." This is what Jesus is wanting, which is why we should be honest about

337
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,200
 our sin, and we should turn away from it. Second Peter 3, 9 says, "The Lord is not slow to fulfill

338
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,360
 his promises. Some count slowness, but he's patient towards you, not wishing that any should perish,

339
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,640
 but that all should reach repentance." Luke 15, 7 says, "I tell you in the same way,

340
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:44,080
 there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons

341
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:53,200
 who do not need to repent." You want to send the heavens into a ruckus accord? Then repent.

342
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:01,040
 That's all it takes. And let me just be really clear on this, because I think often we can get

343
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:11,360
 this confused. When I talk about repentance, I'm not talking about remorse. Repentance is not just

344
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:18,880
 feeling bad about the bad thing you did. It's turning away from the bad thing you did

345
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:28,320
 and moving back towards the only good one, which is God. It's leaving it behind. It's turning it

346
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:39,680
 away. Some of you here, you're so grieved over your sin, but not so much that you're ready to let it go.

347
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,160
 You're so eaten up, the struggle's so hard,

348
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:53,280
 yet you're not so consumed that you would finally let Jesus win the battle for you.

349
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,640
 The best thing some of you can do tonight, the bravest thing some of you can do tonight,

350
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:10,000
 is actually repent of that sin, that lingering sin, which has plagued you for so long.

351
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:24,080
 And the formula is not hard. It's acknowledge it, confess it, accept his grace, and walk away.

352
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:32,880
 That's all it takes. This could be, for some of you, the single moment that you've been wanting

353
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,520
 for all year to finally feel the freedom that Christ has afforded you. If you would come down,

354
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:46,320
 would repent of your sin, and leave it here forever. Do you want that? Because that's

355
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,320
 on the table tonight. You can have that. That's available here.

356
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:57,280
 That's available here. If you want to stir your affections for Jesus, then you got to repent.

357
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:06,560
 Because God, he is closest to honest sinners than silent sufferers. The third thing we see

358
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:15,600
 if we want to remember our first love is we have to return, which means that we have to get really

359
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,720
 serious about surrender. We got to get really serious about surrender. That's what it says in

360
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,640
 verses 19 through 20. "And a number of those who had practiced magic arts, they brought their books

361
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,400
 together and they burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and they found

362
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,400
 it came to 50,000 pieces of silver." Like the Ephesians, they fall so in love with Jesus that

363
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,200
 they start regularly repenting and they burn up these books from their old way of life. Like all

364
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,360
 of these books about magical arts and divination, they once cherished them. And yet, the minute they

365
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,000
 realized that they stand in opposition to their true love, they strike a match and they get rid

366
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,600
 of them. Like they got so serious about their surrender that nothing would stand in the way

367
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:01,360
 of them getting more of Jesus. And we have to do the same. Like there are some things here tonight

368
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:08,640
 that are robbing you of your love for Christ. Robbing you. What do you do to prevent being

369
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:17,120
 robbed? You lock your doors. You set your alarms. You install some cameras. Like I remember when my

370
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,000
 wife and I bought our house in Houston, it came with a security system installed. And I loved it.

371
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,880
 Not just because I could check out the footage, see what was going on down the street. But because I

372
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:38,240
 knew I was able to protect the ones I loved. Some of you are getting robbed and you're doing nothing

373
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:46,160
 about it. Like the enemy is swooping in to steal your joy, take your affection, and you're letting

374
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:53,040
 him. When in reality, there are steps you can take tonight. So let's talk about those. Like really

375
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,160
 practically. Like there are some things in your life, and here's the thing, like they may not be

376
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,800
 bad things. They may be totally morally neutral that you need to give up. Like social media that

377
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,400
 stirs up comparison. Staying over at your boyfriend's house because it's just too late.

378
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,080
 Playing sports because you get overly competitive. That was one for me. Hanging out with those

379
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,720
 friends that you always have one too many with. Listening to that music or watching that TV show.

380
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,760
 Whatever it is, and this is the point, we have to get serious about setting those things aside.

381
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,520
 Whatever's robbing your affection of Jesus, you have got to cut it out of your life.

382
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,880
 You have to light it on fire. You have to burn it where it stands. You've got to get serious about

383
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:40,880
 surrender. Here's the thing, and I know that this is a really heavy talk. I knew that coming in,

384
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,600
 I felt this pressure to like load this thing up with a bunch of stories, to get a bunch of laughs,

385
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:55,280
 and yet what I care more about than hearing your laughter is hearing your learning.

386
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,640
 Knowing that you're actually comprehending the truth of God's word.

387
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,480
 And so this is another hard thing that I want to tell you.

388
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:12,880
 Some of you, you want so badly for the anointing that God has on someone else's life, and yet you're

389
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,960
 not willing to pay the price to get it. Like some of you want so badly for the blessing that God has

390
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,160
 put on somebody else's life, but you're not willing to pay the price to get it. Like some of you want

391
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:31,760
 so badly to get the kind of adoration that God has given to someone else, and yet you're not willing

392
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,000
 to pay the price to get it. Here's what you have got to know. The price of what you lose in this

393
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:45,520
 world, it is nothing in comparison to the prize of what you will find in Christ. That's why you have

394
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,520
 to give whatever it takes, because you get everything and more. Like that's the promise of

395
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:59,840
 Christ. Like in him is all the riches and fullness and glory of God. Why would you look anywhere else

396
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:06,560
 for it? Like nothing's worth having if it keeps us from having him. So last story.

397
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:19,040
 It was this Tuesday, exactly one year ago, when I preached my final message here at the porch

398
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,800
 before I accepted the offer to become the director here in Dallas.

399
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,760
 And I remember like when my wife and I made the trip down to spy out the land and see if this is

400
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,880
 where God wanted us, we were really conflicted. Which is funny for people when I say that,

401
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,800
 because they're like, "What are you talking about, man? Like it's the porch." And yet we were a part

402
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:48,080
 of something that was amazing. Like in a ministry where God was moving and lives were changing and

403
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,520
 stories were shaping and ministry was growing. Like we were a part of something so significant

404
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,920
 that was right at the heart of who God was and what he wanted for people. And so when we came

405
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,240
 here, I was like, "Man, it's going to take a lot to just get us out of where we've been. It's going

406
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,400
 to take more than just a big room with a lot of people and multiple streaming sites across the

407
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,400
 nation. Like that's not enough. Like I don't want to just show up and be the weekly entertainment.

408
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,280
 Like I don't care about the widespread crowds. I care about the lives of people.

409
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,240
 God moving in your story. And what I know is it's happening where we are. And so God, I need to know

410
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,240
 if it's going to happen where we're going. And so I showed up here and I preached a year ago today.

411
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:35,920
 And I remember asking God, "Lord, what I want to see when I'm begging you to give the confirmation

412
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:44,000
 I require, if you'd be gracious enough to give it, is I need to see hunger. Hunger.

413
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,080
 Desire in the lives of these people to not just hang their hat on the fact that, man, like the

414
00:42:52,080 --> 00:43:00,720
 porch is awesome. Look at what God's done. But to believe that God's not finished. That he's still

415
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:09,680
 doing something in this city, in your city, and in every city. Not because of who we are,

416
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:18,240
 because of who he is. And as I preached that night, a stranger to this room and every single one of

417
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:29,840
 you in attendance, I remember I closed my Bible, shut my iPad, said amen, and walked off this

418
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:38,880
 platform. And as I did, I heard applause. Now that can feel really silly to you, like a trite

419
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:46,800
 confirmation. And yet it wasn't an applause that approved of me. It was an applause that approved

420
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:55,920
 of this, that agreed with the word and the God therein. It was an applause from a people

421
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:05,360
 that had been fed by this truth and were hungry for more.

422
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,400
 And I remember, like, when I walked off that platform,

423
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:18,880
 what I felt in that moment was what I feel still today, that God is far from finished in this place.

424
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:26,080
 Not just because we've got great facilities and a really talented band and all the right

425
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:34,320
 production equipment. No, none of those things. God is far from finished because of people like

426
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:41,440
 you and the hunger you have. Some of you are here and you have lost that hunger,

427
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:48,880
 but you can find it again tonight. God comes wherever it is he's wanted.

428
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,720
 Are you wanting for him this evening? We know that Jesus Christ has proven all of this to us

429
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:04,480
 because while we now know we should get focused on Christ, he never lost sight of you.

430
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:12,720
 Well, now we know we should be honest about our sin. Jesus loved your honest self most of all.

431
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:21,600
 And while we now know that we should be serious about surrender, Jesus was so serious

432
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:26,960
 about himself that he surrendered his life for your sake and mine.

433
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:39,280
 Are you hungry? He is wanting for you. He is willing to give the kind of life you want

434
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:48,240
 and even better still. Remember, repent and return. God, we're grateful for tonight.

435
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:57,360
 Thank you for this time. God, I just confess as I stand on this platform and I worked through

436
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:04,080
 this message, I was unsure of how this content would land. Knowing God that it's heavy,

437
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,640
 it can feel hard, even inaccessible to some, to those here, God, that don't know you.

438
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,080
 And yet, Lord, what I'm begging, what I'm praying

439
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:19,440
 is that people would know here at the porch

440
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,200
 and in the lives of those that gather in this room,

441
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,840
 we will not settle for disenchanted discipleship,

442
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:41,360
 but we want to walk in all the wonder and splendor and beauty you and you alone afford.

443
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:54,000
 We want you. God, we want you. Come to us now. Come to us now.
