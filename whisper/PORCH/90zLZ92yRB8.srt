1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,200
 - We did a survey a couple of weeks ago,

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,640
 and thank you for all of you who filled that out

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,560
 with super valuable data to us.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,880
 Anytime you can help us know how better to connect with you

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,200
 or how better to teach or any of the topics to cover.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,160
 And one of the questions we asked was,

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,800
 what topic would you most like to hear about,

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,200
 or do you think is most relevant

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,760
 to the circumstances you're in?

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,260
 And it was unanimous.

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,140
 There was one topic that was way ahead of all the rest.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,940
 Anyone wanna take guess what it was?

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,440
 Dating? It wasn't dating.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,980
 You'd think so.

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,820
 Any other?

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,520
 Peace, okay, yeah.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,360
 It was anxiety and worry.

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,700
 The topic of anxiety and worry was significantly above

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,200
 even dating and every other topic.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,880
 And so we have a very anxious group in our midst.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,440
 And so tonight we're gonna cover the topic

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,440
 of missing out on peace or anxiety and worry.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,120
 And worry, according to Webster's Dictionary,

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,120
 is a state of anxiety resulting from uncertainty

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,800
 over actual or potential problems.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,720
 So we probably all know this,

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,680
 but worry is I'm looking into the future

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,320
 and I'm getting anxious and emotional response in me

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,200
 as I look at what may happen or what could happen,

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,780
 what I fear happening.

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,240
 And I have struggled with anxiety

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,200
 at different periods inside of my life.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,960
 And one of the more kind of blatant ones

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,680
 will kind of set us up for where we're going.

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,040
 It was, I was preparing for my honeymoon

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,760
 and I had planned everything out.

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,120
 I had picked a spot.

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,280
 I was getting married and I was gonna take my then wife

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,880
 or my new wife to this really secluded,

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,000
 incredible boutique resort place for eight days.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,520
 And she's all about relaxing and laying out by the beach.

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,460
 And so this was gonna be great.

44
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,600
 So I broke the bank, kind of went all in on this thing

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,380
 and got ready for this honeymoon.

46
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,120
 And the day before we were supposed to leave,

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,560
 so we got married on a Saturday

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,720
 and we were gonna leave on a Monday.

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,280
 We had a day in between.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,240
 And on that day I was hit with a nervous breakdown

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,520
 like I've never experienced in my entire life.

52
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,240
 It hit me in a weird way that I was basically this,

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,360
 what are we gonna do for the next seven days

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,160
 as I'm trapped on this secluded island?

55
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,720
 I barely even know this woman.

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,880
 What am I doing right now and where are we going?

57
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,480
 And like a panic attack, like it's almost hard to describe.

58
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,860
 It sounds hilarious.

59
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,680
 But literally I began freaking out,

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,560
 like losing short of breath.

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,160
 I was going, oh my gosh, I need to find things to do there.

62
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,080
 And it's secluded, which is great for her,

63
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,400
 but I like to move around.

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,760
 I don't rest very well.

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,400
 And so I'm like freaking out.

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,680
 What am I gonna do?

67
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,520
 So I buy AT&T's international data plan

68
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,780
 so I could like do stuff on the site.

69
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,760
 I went and bought 12 books as I was like,

70
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,360
 I'll just make this an educational trip.

71
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,200
 Here we go.

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,200
 And I just began to think of what can I possibly do?

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,240
 And I know you're thinking, oh, it's your honeymoon.

74
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,040
 I know what you're gonna do on your honeymoon.

75
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,640
 And after 10 minutes, what are you gonna do

76
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,520
 the rest of the time that you're gonna do?

77
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,040
 Just something to think about.

78
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,520
 And so all of this is going through my mind

79
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,520
 and I'm going, oh my gosh, what am I gonna do?

80
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
 And I'm freaking out.

81
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,520
 And so literally I'm having to tell my new wife,

82
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,880
 we just need to pray because I am terrified

83
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,600
 of being trapped on an island with you

84
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,720
 and I don't know what to do,

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,480
 which of course makes every woman really happy to hear.

86
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,360
 And so all of this is kind of going on inside of my heart.

87
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,000
 And as crazy as that sounds, like it sounds ludicrous,

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,340
 even explaining, and the trip was great and it was awesome.

89
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,720
 And all of that disappeared once we had gotten there.

90
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,600
 But as insane as that sounds,

91
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,760
 like why would you worry about that?

92
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,680
 The funny thing about worry is all worry is really insane.

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,780
 Like it's irrational at some level.

94
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,340
 And here's what I mean by that.

95
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,160
 Like worry, it does not ever help the situation.

96
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,280
 In fact, let's just start this way.

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,040
 Has worrying about something,

98
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,080
 if you've ever worried about anything,

99
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,780
 has worrying ever positively contributed

100
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,520
 to the things that you worry about?

101
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,060
 Like is worrying about what's gonna happen

102
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,980
 the next day on that job,

103
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,660
 what's gonna happen in this relationship,

104
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,860
 will we go and get married, what's gonna happen,

105
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,240
 does worrying ever help?

106
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,360
 No.

107
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,960
 Like it always makes things generally worse.

108
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,660
 It takes up our mind, our focus, we're distracted.

109
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,140
 It never, in no situation, helps.

110
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,940
 And it wastes not only our emotional time,

111
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,480
 it wastes our time.

112
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,240
 And time, or life, equals time.

113
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,860
 And so you run out of time, you run out of life.

114
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,860
 Worry, in no circumstances,

115
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,880
 it adds positively to any situation.

116
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,300
 And so really, I mean, what we thought was

117
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,480
 we would give you two words in light of this,

118
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,440
 that worry never provides any benefit,

119
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,800
 and how it makes no sense in any situation.

120
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,960
 And so you might wanna write these down

121
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,020
 if you take notes straight from scripture.

122
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,040
 Here they are.

123
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,820
 In conclusion, stop it.

124
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,660
 Stop worrying.

125
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,780
 Let's close in prayer.

126
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,920
 I mean, it should be like that simple, shouldn't it?

127
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,060
 It makes no sense in any situation,

128
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,200
 it never adds to life, it only takes from a life,

129
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,940
 so why would we worry?

130
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,220
 And the funny thing, in addition to that about worry,

131
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,660
 is that knowing that being anxious,

132
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,820
 or knowing that worrying doesn't help,

133
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,440
 doesn't help.

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,240
 Like knowing that, hey, worrying is not helpful,

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,100
 well, you telling me worrying is not helpful,

136
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,280
 is not helpful, I still am worried.

137
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,800
 Trying to stop worry is like trying to fall asleep at night.

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,100
 It's like, I'm trying to stop, I just can't.

139
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,880
 I'm trying to sleep, I can't fall asleep.

140
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,900
 And so what do we do?

141
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,080
 And really, this isn't just a problem that relates to us.

142
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,680
 According to recent data, the United States as a whole

143
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,800
 would take home, if anxiety and worry was an Olympic sport,

144
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,280
 the gold medal every single year.

145
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,920
 We are a nation of worry warts off the charts.

146
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,400
 Unlike no other country, even in the West,

147
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,360
 America struggles with anxiety.

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
 Here's some stuff from the American Psychological Association

149
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,200
 where it says one third of Americans

150
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,880
 will have an anxiety disorder within their lifetime.

151
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,680
 40 million right now have an anxiety disorder.

152
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,560
 It is the most common mental disorder in America.

153
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,200
 50% of that 40 million is between the ages of 17 and 34,

154
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,360
 so the ages of most of us in this room.

155
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,560
 There's something about our country

156
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,860
 where it is like the land of the free

157
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,540
 and home of the anxious,

158
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,360
 where we are a worried, anxiety-filled people.

159
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,300
 And despite we know the fact that it doesn't help,

160
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,480
 like worrying, it's not gonna really add,

161
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,240
 even knowing that, we can't get rid of our worry.

162
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,560
 52% of millennials, which is young adult, 20s and 30s,

163
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,880
 have, according to American Psychological Association,

164
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,000
 laying awake in the past month due to stress

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,480
 and anxiety, they couldn't fall asleep or lost sleep.

166
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,480
 76% admit to experiencing significant amounts of anxiety

167
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,840
 due to future economic worries.

168
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,520
 And so tonight, we're gonna tackle this topic

169
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,440
 of finding freedom from anxiety.

170
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,600
 And the good news is, is that Jesus,

171
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,800
 who is called the Prince of Peace, think about that.

172
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,760
 The Prince of Peace, standing on a hillside one day,

173
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,520
 addressed the crowd that much like our nation,

174
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,360
 struggled with worry and with anxiety.

175
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,320
 And inside of the verses we're about to read,

176
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,080
 I promise you, if you struggle with anxiety,

177
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,680
 there is a truth and there is something that Jesus says,

178
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,920
 "I want to invite you out of that anxiety,

179
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,160
 "and if you will listen and you will apply,

180
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,560
 "you will find freedom from that."

181
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,600
 So we're gonna learn from the Prince of Peace

182
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,720
 on how to experience peace,

183
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,200
 or experience freedom from our anxiety.

184
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,800
 We're gonna be in Matthew chapter six.

185
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,240
 If you have a Bible, you can open up to Matthew chapter six.

186
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,280
 Should be somewhat near halfway of your Bible.

187
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,000
 If you hit Psalms, keep going right.

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,320
 And then you hit Matthew, if you hit Mark, Luke, John,

189
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,600
 or any other books, turn back to Matthew.

190
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,560
 We'll be in chapter six.

191
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,720
 This is the Sermon on the Mount.

192
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,920
 Without a question, Jesus' most famous teaching.

193
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,720
 And we're gonna be picking it up in verse 24.

194
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,160
 Here we go.

195
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,760
 "No one," Jesus speaking.

196
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,840
 So he looks out into this audience

197
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,400
 and he starts with an illustration.

198
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,960
 "No one can serve two masters.

199
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,480
 "Either you will hate the one and love the other,

200
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,320
 "or you will be devoted to one and despise the other."

201
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,920
 So Jesus starts saying, "Just like a servant

202
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,560
 "can't serve two masters."

203
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,320
 A servant has one master that they are devoted to.

204
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,600
 In the same way, so let me use this illustration,

205
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
 Jesus would say, to bridge how this works.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
 Jesus would say, to bridge how this relates to you.

207
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,640
 You cannot serve or be a servant of both God and money.

208
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,160
 And the little word money,

209
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,860
 it's really not a great translation.

210
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,640
 It's the word mammon.

211
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,880
 And if you have a study Bible,

212
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,560
 it may even have a footnote that says mammon.

213
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,000
 And mammon was a personification of accumulation,

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,920
 which sounds funny.

215
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,760
 It was basically a word in this culture

216
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,120
 which just meant the God of accumulating, of getting stuff.

217
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,460
 Jesus says, "You can't serve both God's kingdom

218
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,120
 "and your kingdom."

219
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,660
 At the end of the day, you can seek after both at some level

220
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,300
 but you're going to have to make a decision.

221
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,520
 Ultimately, who is your master?

222
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,520
 You cannot serve both God and his kingdom and your kingdom.

223
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,060
 And so he uses this as a launching point

224
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,580
 into how depending on whose kingdom you serve

225
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,380
 will determine the anxiety you experience.

226
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,800
 Here's what he says, verse 25.

227
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,220
 "Therefore," in light of that,

228
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,100
 in light of the fact that you can't serve both,

229
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,820
 "and as followers of Christ, you are to serve God's kingdom.

230
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,820
 "Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life."

231
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,020
 Which on the surface seems like very unhelpful.

232
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,700
 Jesus, you tell me not to worry.

233
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,300
 No one wants to worry.

234
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,120
 Don't worry.

235
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,480
 Have you ever had someone who was around you

236
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,220
 and they just are kind of like the happy-go-lucky

237
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,620
 and they're like, just don't worry about it.

238
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,780
 And like, yeah, thank you.

239
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,820
 That's really helpful.

240
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,700
 If you could call me every hour

241
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,020
 and just say, don't worry about it,

242
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,420
 that would really help me.

243
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,820
 No, it doesn't help at all.

244
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,700
 And so Jesus, he's going somewhere.

245
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,660
 And so it's not just don't worry.

246
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,820
 But he says, I want you to do something else.

247
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,660
 Here we go.

248
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,180
 What you will eat, so don't worry about your life,

249
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,220
 including what you will eat or what you will drink

250
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,380
 or about your body, what you will wear.

251
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,340
 So he connects with the things his audience is worried about.

252
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,180
 In our context, it would look more like this.

253
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,680
 Don't worry about being married by 30.

254
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,180
 Don't worry about what other people think about you.

255
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,100
 Don't worry about whether the economy is gonna crumble.

256
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,780
 Don't worry, am I in the right job?

257
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,580
 Don't worry, who am I gonna live with

258
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,860
 if my roommates move out and they all get married?

259
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,460
 Don't worry about your biological clock

260
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,540
 and it's ticking away.

261
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,700
 And am I gonna find someone?

262
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,020
 Don't worry about whether or not the person you're dating

263
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,660
 is gonna sit next to someone cute in their cube at work.

264
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,940
 Don't worry, he would say,

265
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,220
 to all of the things that we worry about.

266
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,180
 And he's not saying don't worry

267
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,500
 because they're not important.

268
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,820
 In fact, he's gonna make the opposite case in a second.

269
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,100
 And he's not saying don't care.

270
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
 He is saying, I want you to know

271
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,660
 there is a way to face uncertainty

272
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,380
 and to not worry about it.

273
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,140
 And I am inviting you to step into a place

274
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,540
 where you are free from worry.

275
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,440
 He continues.

276
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,260
 Is not life more important than food

277
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,880
 and the body more important than clothes?

278
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,140
 And so the word important,

279
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,240
 here's what's interesting about this,

280
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,500
 is really not in the original text.

281
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,860
 In fact, depending on your translation,

282
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,820
 you may not have important.

283
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,820
 It's is not life more than food or more than clothes?

284
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,900
 And what he's trying to do, and this is so brilliant,

285
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,960
 Jesus was such a brilliant teacher,

286
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,980
 is he's trying to pull his audience back

287
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,380
 from the things that they worry about

288
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,100
 that they get so hyper-focused on it becomes consuming.

289
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,420
 That's all I can think about.

290
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,040
 And so he goes, look, is life not more than just food?

291
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
 Is it not more than clothes?

292
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,380
 For us, he would say, is it not more than being married?

293
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,180
 Like, does marriage equal life?

294
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,160
 Does having a kid equal life?

295
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,920
 Does the opinion of that person equal life?

296
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,960
 Does food, if you stacked all those things up,

297
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,240
 would you go, yeah, that's life.

298
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,080
 That's all that there is.

299
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,560
 I would never have any other cares.

300
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
 And we go, no, no, those don't equal life.

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
 Jesus is going, exactly.

302
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,420
 But they get all of your focus and all of your attention

303
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,700
 and are taking up your life.

304
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,580
 And it's, in a brilliant way, it pulls us back

305
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,960
 because here's what worry further does.

306
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,620
 It paralyzes us to where we never chase down

307
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,620
 the things we're worried about.

308
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,940
 I don't know how to explain this very well.

309
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,820
 It forces us, or it makes us like so focused

310
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,500
 on what if I don't get that job

311
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,080
 that all I think about is that job

312
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,840
 and I never chase down the end result of that fear.

313
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,080
 What if you don't get that job?

314
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,000
 Well, then I wouldn't have a job.

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,800
 And then what would happen?

316
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,720
 Well, I guess I'd have to look for another job.

317
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,000
 Okay, well, then what would happen?

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,800
 What if I didn't find another job?

319
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,720
 Well, then what would happen?

320
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,640
 Well, I guess I'd have to figure out

321
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,600
 what I would do monetarily.

322
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,920
 Well, then what would happen?

323
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
 What if I never get married?

324
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,400
 What if I stay single for the rest of my life?

325
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,120
 Well, then what would happen?

326
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,160
 Well, I'd be single for the rest of my life.

327
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,840
 And then what would happen?

328
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,340
 I guess I'd die single and go to be with Jesus.

329
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,400
 Okay, and then what would happen?

330
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,240
 Well, I'd be with them forever and ever and ever.

331
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,120
 We never chase down.

332
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,620
 So Jesus is trying to pull them back

333
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,220
 and say the things you worry about

334
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,520
 that are consuming your life,

335
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,640
 they're not as big as the worry

336
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,320
 you're experiencing makes them.

337
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,520
 And so I wanna pull you back,

338
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,360
 not that they're not important,

339
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,400
 but that life consists of more than that.

340
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,240
 He continues.

341
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,280
 And he's outside and so he looks up

342
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,880
 and he sees birds fly by and he goes,

343
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,360
 look at the birds of the air.

344
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,680
 They do not sow or reap or store away in barns

345
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,680
 all things his audience did.

346
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,000
 So they're worried about food and he's going,

347
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,280
 look at the birds of the air.

348
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,480
 And this isn't like Bob Marley Jesus being like,

349
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,900
 just don't worry, look at the birds, man.

350
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,800
 This is Jesus and he's really, I promise you,

351
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,520
 he's trying to help them.

352
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,960
 And he says, look, you guys,

353
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,000
 you reap and you store away in barns,

354
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,240
 look at the birds, they don't do anything like that.

355
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,920
 So as he would say, look,

356
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,560
 you don't need to worry about whether or not

357
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,680
 you get married or whether or not

358
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,120
 you're gonna have a job.

359
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,600
 Birds don't do anything like that.

360
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,500
 They don't save up, they don't have a 401k.

361
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,680
 They don't go to christianmingle.com.

362
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,640
 They don't do any of the things that you do.

363
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,800
 The birds, God provides for them

364
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,640
 and they don't even really try.

365
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,120
 They're not responsible like you.

366
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,780
 They just fly around and are like,

367
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,400
 I think we should fly south.

368
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,080
 This feels so familiar.

369
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,880
 And then they look at another bird to mate.

370
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,120
 Like the birds of the air, Jesus's point is,

371
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,200
 they don't even really try in the way that you do.

372
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,160
 They don't store or reap.

373
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,440
 And yet your heavenly father feeds them.

374
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,840
 Jesus says, let me ask you a question.

375
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,440
 Are you not much more valuable or valuable to God than they?

376
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:55,080
 Do you think that the God who cares for the birds of the air

377
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,880
 could care about them more than he cares for you?

378
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,760
 Do you think, I know this is a hard question

379
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,500
 and maybe you've grown up with animal lovers

380
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,960
 who put their dogs in sweaters,

381
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,340
 but do you think that the God of the universe

382
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,340
 cares more, Jesus says, for a bird than he does for you?

383
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,680
 When it came to man, when he created all kinds of cool stuff

384
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,040
 he created the birds, he created all of creation

385
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,600
 and plants and animals and all that stuff.

386
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,160
 But when he came to man, he said,

387
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,080
 there's something different about this one.

388
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,640
 This one alone is in my image.

389
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,600
 I'm gonna send my own son to die.

390
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,280
 And he didn't send him in the image of a bird.

391
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,380
 He sent him in the form of a man to die on a cross.

392
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,880
 Do you think that the God who's there cares more

393
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,780
 for birds who he provides for than you?

394
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:47,080
 And then he continues.

395
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,800
 In case you're thinking, it's almost like he responds

396
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,120
 to a reaction in his audience who are like, great,

397
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,640
 this bird thing is not helping, I'm anxious,

398
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,920
 I got bills to pay.

399
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,520
 And he responds by going, okay, in case I'm losing you,

400
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,280
 who of you, verse 27, by worrying

401
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,520
 can add a single hour to your life?

402
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
 Okay, so you don't like the bird thing?

403
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,720
 Let me ask you this.

404
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,320
 Does worrying help?

405
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,960
 Like, can you add life onto, or can you extend your life

406
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,260
 through worrying about something?

407
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,880
 To which we would all say no.

408
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,480
 In fact, science has now come out and said

409
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,040
 that worrying not only doesn't add to it,

410
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,360
 it takes away time off of our life.

411
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,200
 It is as struggling with anxiety,

412
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,400
 according to psychologists and medical professionals,

413
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,920
 is as dangerous as struggling with smoking.

414
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,240
 They take and can have the same effect on someone's body.

415
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,080
 Then anxiety doesn't add, it only takes away.

416
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,640
 And so Jesus says, if you don't like that,

417
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,760
 look, I'm telling you, I want you to be free from worry

418
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,960
 and it's not gonna help you.

419
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,040
 And so he continues, giving us a second illustration.

420
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,880
 Verse 28, and why don't you worry about clothes?

421
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,840
 And why do you worry about clothes?

422
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,120
 See how the lilies of the field grow.

423
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,420
 They do not labor or spin, which they did, in his audience.

424
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,360
 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon

425
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,940
 in all of his splendor was dressed like one of these.

426
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,000
 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field,

427
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
 which is here today and tomorrow is thrown in the fire,

428
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,080
 will he not much more clothe you?

429
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,960
 Oh, you of little faith.

430
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,520
 And he introduces this idea that there is a relationship

431
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,500
 between the size of your faith and the size of your worry,

432
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,120
 that there is a relationship.

433
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,760
 And if you struggle with anxiety,

434
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,820
 you need to know, and it sounds almost offensive, Jesus,

435
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,860
 that there is a relationship

436
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,760
 between the size of your faith and the size of your worry.

437
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,460
 It says, oh, you of little faith.

438
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,980
 The phrase, oh, you of little faith, is so interesting

439
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,700
 because it's the only place,

440
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,740
 it's the only time we see Jesus, this word used.

441
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,640
 It's used only by Jesus.

442
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,260
 It's as though he made up the word.

443
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,560
 It's like a compound word.

444
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,740
 He takes little and faith and he puts them together.

445
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,900
 It's like loud talker or close talker.

446
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,740
 It's like a made up word,

447
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,060
 but it kind of describes what we're going for.

448
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,220
 This is what Jesus does here.

449
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,260
 And he takes these two words and he says,

450
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,480
 you're a little faither.

451
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,520
 That's what you are.

452
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,820
 You're a little faither.

453
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,660
 You think that God created everything that is.

454
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,480
 He created the birds and he feeds them.

455
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,140
 He put the stars and he hung them in place.

456
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,740
 You think that God made everything

457
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,920
 and he controls all that is and he's loving.

458
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,200
 And yet he's not in control of your circumstances.

459
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,300
 You're a little faither, he says.

460
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,000
 And he's trying to help them identify

461
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,180
 that there is a relationship between the size of our faith

462
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,100
 and the size of our worry.

463
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,500
 And it's as though he says, let me make it further clear.

464
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,680
 So do not worry, saying what shall we eat

465
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,500
 and what shall we drink or what shall we wear

466
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,100
 for the pagans, the pagans,

467
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,140
 any pagans here in the room tonight?

468
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,980
 I'm kidding.

469
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,380
 Pagans was a word of a person who did not know God,

470
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,660
 a person who did not believe they had a heavenly father,

471
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,820
 a person who believed in a foreign God or no God at all.

472
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,680
 And he says, this is what pagans do.

473
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,820
 They run after all these things

474
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,440
 and your heavenly father knows that you need them.

475
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:35,020
 That he says, there are people who act

476
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,460
 as though they don't have anyone to watch their back

477
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,020
 and they're called pagans.

478
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,220
 They run after all those things.

479
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,900
 They should worry about those things, but you are different.

480
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,180
 You have a heavenly father who loves you,

481
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,180
 who is in control, who has promised to work all things

482
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,020
 for your good.

483
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,700
 And he says, look, don't let worry,

484
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,380
 which is a pagan thing to do.

485
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,400
 It is a pagan sport.

486
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,500
 Worry is not meant to mark the lives of believers.

487
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,960
 He says, don't let anxiety back you

488
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,780
 into the same self-centered, self-focused life

489
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,260
 that all the rest of humanity runs into.

490
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,040
 You have a heavenly father who knows what you need,

491
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,560
 who loves you, who is in control of all things.

492
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,000
 And he says, look, anxiety, if you let it,

493
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,280
 will back you into a self-centered corner

494
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,040
 where only people who don't have someone

495
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,880
 watching their back belong.

496
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,400
 And he wants you to be free from that,

497
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,480
 that you have been invited and I've been invited

498
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,600
 to release our worry and to experience freedom.

499
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,820
 And he's about to give us the verse

500
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,520
 on really how this takes place.

501
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,800
 And I think this is so huge.

502
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,600
 And if you struggle with anxiety, I really feel for you

503
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,840
 'cause I can relate on a number of levels.

504
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,900
 Anxiety, unlike other struggles,

505
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,160
 is not something any of us want.

506
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,760
 Like if you look at porn, there's an element

507
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,160
 where you're like, I kinda wanna look at porn.

508
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,040
 If you struggle with materialism, you're like,

509
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,380
 yeah, I just wanted this purse, I wanted these whatever.

510
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,040
 But no one wants to be anxious.

511
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,700
 And God loves you and he's provided a way

512
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,400
 and he offers a solution to it.

513
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
 And it's in this next verse and it's a verse

514
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,480
 that you've probably heard so many times

515
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,960
 that it no longer has the same effect on you.

516
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,420
 But here it is in verse 31.

517
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,200
 Here is the solution.

518
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,320
 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness

519
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,700
 and all of these things will be given to you as well.

520
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,040
 So seek first.

521
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,400
 And here's I think what people,

522
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,360
 when you struggle with anxiety,

523
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,600
 and often we teach it this way so it's wrong.

524
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,000
 It's hey, don't worry, just go on a mission trip.

525
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,680
 Don't worry, go share your faith.

526
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,640
 Don't worry, be seeking his kingdom first.

527
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,640
 This first, the word seek, is more closely resembling

528
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,680
 to surrender first.

529
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,720
 In other words, when it comes to whose kingdom

530
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,880
 is going to be the first focus,

531
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,520
 the thing that I'm devoted to,

532
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,720
 God says, here's how you do it.

533
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,720
 I want you to seek first or embrace first my kingdom

534
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,080
 above your kingdom.

535
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,360
 I want when it comes for the competition

536
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,400
 of what's going to be in first place,

537
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,080
 whose kingdom is gonna be in first place,

538
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,720
 I want you to not let it be a competition

539
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,820
 and place my kingdom, God says, in first place.

540
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,720
 My agenda, my will for your life.

541
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,940
 And whose kingdom competes for God's kingdom?

542
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,340
 In my life, it's mine.

543
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,840
 The things that I worry about are fueled

544
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,840
 by me putting my agenda or my kingdom first.

545
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,880
 The things that I worry about are all about

546
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,800
 I want this to be this way.

547
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,840
 I want to be married X time.

548
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,600
 I want to have this amount of money and savings.

549
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,480
 I want to have security if the economy crumbles.

550
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,760
 And he says, look, if you want to experience freedom,

551
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,160
 it begins by surrendering first place

552
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,760
 whose kingdom you're gonna serve.

553
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,360
 You cannot serve both God and your kingdom.

554
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,480
 And so it begins by seeking first

555
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,480
 or embracing first his kingdom above your kingdom.

556
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,480
 I think this is what I wrote in my notes

557
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,720
 is it looks like this, God, I want to be married.

558
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,560
 And you know how desperately I want to be married

559
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,900
 or I want to have a job.

560
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,780
 Or you know how much I'm afraid

561
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,520
 of what my boss thinks about me.

562
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,340
 But your kingdom before my kingdom, I'm trusting you.

563
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,080
 If it doesn't work out, I'm trusting

564
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,240
 as your will unfolds, your will before my will.

565
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,120
 He brings us back to something, honestly,

566
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,220
 that he said like 20 verses before

567
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,140
 with the same two words, he just said it.

568
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,080
 And then he gives us this again.

569
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,920
 Here's what he says.

570
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,980
 This is in Matthew six, verse nine and 10.

571
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,920
 This then is how you should pray.

572
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,560
 Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name

573
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,380
 or holy is your name.

574
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,440
 Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth.

575
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,200
 That's my earth, that's where I live.

576
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 That's my life.

577
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,720
 Your will be done in my life as it is in heaven.

578
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
 Your kingdom come in front of mine.

579
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,560
 God says the remedy, if you want to experience

580
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,040
 and step into the direction of peace

581
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,520
 is by saying your kingdom before mine,

582
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,280
 your will before mine.

583
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,200
 God, you know how desperately I want this,

584
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,200
 but I'm trusting you, your kingdom, your will.

585
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,300
 You love me and you control everything.

586
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,260
 And so even though my circumstances,

587
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,260
 I wouldn't work them out this way,

588
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,380
 I'm gonna trust you.

589
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,780
 Your kingdom comes before mine.

590
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:55,200
 I wrote down that, God, you know my roommate is moving out.

591
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,580
 I've done everything that I can.

592
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,040
 I don't know where I'm going to live,

593
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,180
 but I'm surrendering to you.

594
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:05,180
 I'm trusting you, your kingdom, your will before my will.

595
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,500
 You know how little I have in savings,

596
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,020
 and if I don't get this job, I'm trusting you,

597
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,620
 your kingdom, this is not how my kingdom

598
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,500
 would have done things, but yours before mine.

599
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,440
 This like totally changed my perspective

600
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,580
 on worry and anxiety.

601
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,980
 And I think one of the reasons it did

602
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,860
 is because when you struggle with worry,

603
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,660
 you get caught in like, I don't know what else to do.

604
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,380
 I just get used to like panicking,

605
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,900
 or I just get used to getting worried.

606
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,540
 And it gives us an alternative.

607
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,500
 Jesus says, I want to invite you to an alternative response

608
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,260
 to experience freedom from that.

609
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,620
 And it really did.

610
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,460
 Like we are moving towards a season

611
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,260
 where we want to start trying at some point,

612
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,100
 or we want to have kids.

613
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,260
 We hope to have a family someday, my wife and I.

614
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:58,420
 And I have this weird fear that like we won't be able to.

615
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,540
 And it's unfounded at this level right now at least.

616
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,260
 But I have this like fear in the back of my head

617
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,500
 that what if we can't?

618
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,940
 And my temptation will be to like tailspin,

619
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,260
 oh my gosh, what if we couldn't,

620
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,620
 and think about it and worry about it

621
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,820
 and try to take control.

622
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,460
 And it's realizing this, that I'm able to go,

623
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,700
 I wouldn't have done it that way, God.

624
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,500
 And if we can't, I'm choosing to trust you.

625
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,320
 I know you love me.

626
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,240
 I know you control everything.

627
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,240
 So help me to trust you and your will be done in my life

628
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,880
 before my will.

629
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,340
 Even though that's not what I would want.

630
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,080
 Your kingdom comes before mine,

631
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,800
 and it gives me a peace 'cause I can let it go.

632
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,360
 And trust or hold on and attempt to trust

633
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,040
 the God who loves me and who loves you.

634
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,560
 And I think where most of us get stuck is we go,

635
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,280
 look, if I just open my hand

636
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,000
 and I stop gripping onto the wheel and not taking control,

637
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,920
 what if things don't work out the way I want them to?

638
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,040
 What if I don't get married

639
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,680
 and I'm the 50-year-old cat lady?

640
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,080
 What if I never have a job?

641
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,120
 What if I end up being homeless?

642
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,480
 What about, what about, what about?

643
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,880
 And the reality is,

644
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,280
 what do you think's happening right now anyways?

645
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,360
 Like you have no control.

646
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,420
 Control is an illusion.

647
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,560
 There's no opening your hands, there's no alternative.

648
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,960
 You can either be worried

649
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,780
 and experience the illusion of worry,

650
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,000
 or you can trust the only one who's ever been in control,

651
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,400
 the prince of peace,

652
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,240
 and surrender, and trust him.

653
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,560
 And you know what's good about that?

654
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,920
 He loves you more than you love yourself.

655
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,240
 He's way more in control than you have ever been

656
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,360
 or ever will be.

657
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,940
 He loves you enough to die for you,

658
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,960
 and he's saying, look, I'm inviting you.

659
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,240
 And if you have anxiety in the room,

660
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,940
 I know the temptation is to go, you don't know my story,

661
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,160
 you don't know what it's about,

662
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,560
 and I promise you, the prince of peace

663
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,160
 is offering you a first step into finding freedom

664
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,640
 from worry and anxiety.

665
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,520
 And it comes by handing over the control

666
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,240
 that's been his all along,

667
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,440
 and saying, God, I trust you.

668
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,960
 I trust you.

669
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,240
 Will you help me trust you?

670
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,000
 And your will be done in every arena of my life,

671
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,860
 before my will.

672
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,720
 He closes with this, verse 34.

673
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,960
 Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow,

674
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,000
 for tomorrow will worry about itself.

675
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Each day has enough trouble of its own.

676
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,080
 So do all you can today, and then trust him with tomorrow.

677
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,200
 I'm gonna do all that I can today,

678
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,360
 and I'm gonna trust you with tomorrow.

679
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,640
 There's a famous pastor in the 1930s

680
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,240
 who really, in light of this verse,

681
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,440
 said, God is inviting us to not put our confidence

682
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,840
 in what tomorrow holds,

683
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,720
 but in the one who holds tomorrow.

684
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,100
 God is inviting us to not put our confidence,

685
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,600
 or our faith in what tomorrow holds,

686
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,800
 or what we think it may,

687
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,960
 but in the one who holds tomorrow, who loves you,

688
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,400
 and is inviting you to trust him,

689
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,300
 and your kingdom may not unfold the way you want it to,

690
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,120
 but it's gonna happen anyways.

691
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,600
 And he's saying, my kingdom, my agenda,

692
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,480
 is better than what your agenda and your will.

693
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,560
 Will you trust me, and experience freedom from worry?

694
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,360
 Jesus is not only just the perfect teacher

695
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,320
 of just an example of experiencing overwhelming circumstances

696
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,080
 and looking out in the future and facing uncertainty,

697
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,440
 but he's the perfect, he walked through it perfectly,

698
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,600
 and really models out what it looks like to live this way.

699
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,600
 He does this in Mark 14, verse 34, where he says this.

700
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,560
 "My soul," this is Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane,

701
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,440
 so he's in just incredibly dramatic circumstances,

702
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,080
 hours away from his death, and he's looking out,

703
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,000
 and he does exactly what we're talking about,

704
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,560
 where he says, I don't like what I'm facing,

705
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,760
 but I'm gonna choose to trust you.

706
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,060
 Here's what happens, verse 34.

707
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,680
 "My soul," Jesus speaking,

708
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,080
 "is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.

709
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,040
 "Going a little farther, he fell to the ground,

710
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,800
 "and he prayed," and listen to his prayer,

711
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,880
 "if possible, this hour might pass from him.

712
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,880
 "'Abba, Father,' he said, 'everything is possible for you.

713
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,580
 "'Take this cup from me.'

714
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,820
 "So I don't like this.

715
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,520
 "Father, will you change these circumstances?

716
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,520
 "But not my will, but your will be done."

717
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,600
 Not mine, yours.

718
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,000
 Your kingdom come in my life, in my earth,

719
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,960
 in my surroundings, as it is in heaven.

720
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,360
 Your will be done.

721
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:03,720
 A couple years ago, we taught on this topic very similarly,

722
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,720
 and afterwards, a 22-year-old kid came down front.

723
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,360
 He was really young.

724
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,680
 No, he was 21 at the time.

725
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,280
 And we just taught this exact passage,

726
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,920
 and he came down and he said,

727
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,160
 he was really kind, he said, "Thank you."

728
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,120
 It really helped, and he began to explain

729
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,120
 he had a brain tumor, and it was really uncertain

730
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,040
 what was ahead for him.

731
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,880
 As small as three to six months to who knows,

732
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,040
 and he said he'd been wrestling with just such anxiety.

733
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,840
 He drove in five hours because he had heard

734
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,040
 that they were covering anxiety,

735
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,720
 or anxiety was a topic we're gonna talk about

736
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,840
 in a little bit, but he was so anxious.

737
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,080
 It was a topic we're gonna talk about,

738
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,400
 which is kind of like, man, you should've

739
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,440
 just watched the podcast, but he did it,

740
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,680
 and he came in, and he just began to say,

741
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,000
 man, that thank you, and the next week,

742
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,680
 he sent an email in, and in it, he just said,

743
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,020
 look, I was so wrestling with what my future held,

744
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,400
 and that night, I got on my knees,

745
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,200
 and I just prayed, God, your kingdom, I don't wanna die.

746
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,360
 'Cause your kingdom comes before mine.

747
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,360
 Your will be done, and my kingdom,

748
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,720
 that's not what I would do.

749
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,560
 Will you change my circumstances?

750
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,180
 But if you don't, your will before mine.

751
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,800
 And I remember reading that and going, oh my gosh.

752
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,520
 I wanna have faith like that.

753
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,720
 I wanna have faith that takes that step,

754
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,480
 says God, I'm trusting you.

755
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,340
 I'm choosing to trust that you love me, you're for me.

756
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,400
 I can't even understand how this could be the better kingdom

757
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,480
 but your will be done in my life and my world.

758
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,860
 There is a faith that overtakes fear.

759
00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:00,400
 Fear is powerful, and the only thing,

760
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,720
 or the two things that Scripture defines

761
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,800
 or describes as more powerful than fear,

762
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,160
 I mean, people do all kinds of things.

763
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,500
 I was afraid that drives them to do all kinds of things.

764
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,660
 And the Scripture tells us there's two things.

765
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,800
 Perfect love is more powerful than fear.

766
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,660
 Perfect love displayed by God himself on a cross for you,

767
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,100
 and if you will let him, will drive that fear

768
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,540
 and wants to drive that from your life.

769
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,380
 And the second thing is this, faith.

770
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,180
 There is a faith that God wants you to experience

771
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,720
 and me to experience that overtakes fear.

772
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,060
 And he's inviting you and calling you out to that.

773
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,200
 And the first step is surrendering.

774
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,260
 God, your agenda before my agenda.

775
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,280
 I can be worried, and if you're worried,

776
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,820
 your worries tell you the things in your kingdom

777
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,600
 that you're afraid of losing.

778
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,720
 And he's saying, I'm inviting you

779
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,720
 to experience a life free from anxiety, free from worry.

780
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,860
 And there is a faith that if you will begin to trust me

781
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,500
 day by day, one day at a time,

782
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,080
 there is a faith that overtakes all fear.

783
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,060
 And I want you to experience it.

784
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,100
 I'm gonna pray that God would allow us to tonight,

785
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,420
 if we're wrestling with anxiety,

786
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,560
 and we'd love to talk to you about it,

787
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,160
 experience a peace from the Prince of Peace from that fear.

788
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,640
 Father, we believe by faith that you love us.

789
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,900
 We believe by faith that you are in control,

790
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,580
 regardless of whether our circumstances indicate that,

791
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,140
 regardless of whether our kingdom

792
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,520
 is unfolding the way we hoped it would be.

793
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,760
 Would you in your grace allow us to experience

794
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,280
 a faith that overtakes the fear in our life?

795
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,340
 The most common command you give us is fear not.

796
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:09,740
 More than anything else, you invite us to fear not.

797
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,860
 For those of us who struggle with anxiety,

798
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,000
 would you call us out into that faith?

799
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,020
 Where your fear, or where our fears are driven away.

800
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,060
 We love you and we need your help, Lord.

801
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,900
 We believe in you, but we need your help

802
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,900
 to believe you more, and so would you give us that

803
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,860
 in your grace tonight, amen.
