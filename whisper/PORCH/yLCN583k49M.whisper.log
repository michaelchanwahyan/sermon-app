[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   My kids are gonna be jealous, man.
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.920]   Phil Wickham's the soundtrack of the Stewart House.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.000]   So thank you, brother, for leading us.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Can we just say thank you to Phil again for leading us?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Hey, I wanna say thank you to David too,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   and the team for putting this on.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.240]   What an amazing, important time for us to gather together.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720]   So awesome to be here with you.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.320]   And if you got a copy of your scriptures with you,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.560]   we gotta jump right in, folks.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.880]   We're in Ephesians chapter two.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.040]   Ephesians chapter two.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.560]   I wanna read to you a big section of scripture
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.960]   to kind of load it into your mind.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960]   We'll pray and then jump into what the Lord has for us today.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.080]   So Ephesians chapter two.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.880]   If you don't have a copy of your scriptures, just listen.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.800]   I'll read it out loud,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.720]   and then we'll pray and jump in together.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.560]   But Ephesians two, verse one begins like this.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.440]   "And you were dead in the trespasses and sins
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.600]   in which you once walked,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.640]   following the course of this world,
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.840]   following the prince of the power of the air,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.400]   the spirit that's now at work in the sons of disobedience,
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.280]   among whom we all once lived,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.320]   in the passions of our flesh,
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.680]   carrying out the desires of the flesh,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.940]   of the body and the mind,
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.060]   and were by nature children of wrath
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.320]   like the rest of mankind.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.000]   But God, being rich in mercy,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.240]   because of the great love with which he loved us,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.880]   even when we were dead in our trespasses,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.860]   made us alive together with Christ.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.360]   By grace you've been saved.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.200]   And he raised us up with him and seated us with him
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.740]   in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.080]   so that in the coming age,
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.320]   he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.000]   and kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   For by grace you have been saved through faith."
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.260]   This is not of yourselves.
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.040]   It is a gift of God.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.680]   Not a result of works so that no one may boast,
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.800]   for we are his workmanship.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.000]   Created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.460]   which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.180]   Therefore, remember that at one time,
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.040]   you, Gentiles in the flesh,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.400]   called the uncircumcision by what is called
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.800]   the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hand.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.080]   Remember that you were at that time separated from Christ,
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.160]   alienated from the commonwealth of Israel,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.920]   strangers to the covenants of promise,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.120]   having no hope and without God in the world.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.000]   But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.360]   have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.680]   For he himself is our peace, who's made us both one
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.440]   and has broken down in his flesh
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.200]   the dividing wall of hostility
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.920]   by abolishing the law of commandments and ordinances
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.700]   that he might create in himself one new man
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.200]   in place of the two, so making peace
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.440]   and might reconcile us both to God
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.000]   in one body through the cross,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.920]   thereby killing the hostility.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.000]   He came and preached peace to you who are far off,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.120]   peace to those who were near.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.680]   Through him, we both have access
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.400]   in one spirit to the father.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.160]   So then you're no longer strangers, aliens,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.440]   your fellow citizens with the saints
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.520]   and members of the household of God,
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.080]   built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.760]   Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.160]   in whom this whole structure being joined together
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.760]   grows into a holy temple in the Lord.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.600]   In him, you are also being built together
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.880]   in the dwelling place for God by this spirit.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.640]   You read chapter four, verse one.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.640]   I therefore, a prisoner of the Lord urge you,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.680]   walk in a manner worthy of the calling
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.560]   to which you've been called,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.280]   with humility and gentleness, with patience,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.600]   bearing with one another in love,
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.720]   eager to maintain the unity of the spirit
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.820]   and the bond of peace.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.560]   Well, fathers, we take up this subject
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.760]   of what it means to be united in love.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.700]   I just pray at the outset, let it be.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.600]   Let us know what it is to be loved by you.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.080]   And let's take up the high and challenging call
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.160]   of loving each other.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.700]   Not hypothetically, propositionally loving people,
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.240]   but in a real gritty way, love the people
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.080]   to our left and our right.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.480]   The world needs to see it to help us do it.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.960]   And I wanna invite you, if you're willing
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.720]   to just take a minute and pray, and you ask him,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.520]   say, God, please teach us tonight.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.640]   And then if you would, please pray for me,
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.280]   that the Lord would use me and I'd be helpful to you.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.440]   (silence)
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:53.400]   Father, we love you and we trust you.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.140]   Use this time, we pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.880]   Well, when I was right out of college,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.320]   my family decided to take a vacation in Colorado,
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.120]   where my brother was living at the time.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.000]   So we flew up there and jumped into his car,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.160]   threw all our gear in the back and drove up to this resort.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.280]   And I remember as we were getting out of the car,
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.080]   I grabbed my bag and was walking through the parking lot
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.720]   and my mom asked me a question.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.480]   She said, "Ben, is that your underwear on the ground?"
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.120]   And I looked and I was like, "Yes."
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.800]   That's odd, and tucked it in and we walked into this hotel.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.240]   And as soon as we walked into the hotel,
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.880]   the bottom of my bag flipped open like a lid
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.760]   and all my clothes fell out.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.920]   Remember, I was like, "What a cheap bag."
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.880]   So I kind of had to grab all my possessions
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.640]   and wandered through the lobby holding them.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.600]   And we went up to the room and we decided,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.760]   well, that was a weird start,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.160]   but we were heading out to dinner.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.920]   And at that moment, my brother realized
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.200]   he'd forgotten pants.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.560]   So he asked if he could borrow a pair of pants.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.480]   Then I gave him my favorite pair of jeans.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.800]   And we went to dinner.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.920]   I remember as we were walking back, I looked
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.820]   and there was a huge rip in them and not a cool one,
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.800]   like an awkward, "You ruined them," rip in my pants.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.920]   And I was like, "What have you done?"
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.760]   He's like, "I don't know."
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.920]   I'm like, "What do you mean you don't know?
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.760]   "Take them off."
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.840]   And we got to the end of what had become
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.040]   a very strange trip.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.560]   But the next morning we were excited.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.400]   We're about to go whitewater rafting together.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.220]   It's very cool.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.140]   And so I remember we got in this boat
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.560]   and it was like three of us guys got in with this guide.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.200]   And it didn't take very long down the river
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.800]   before he looked at me and my brother and his friend
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.680]   and was like, "Hey, you guys seem to know
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.640]   "what you're doing out here."
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.160]   We're like, "Yeah, what's up, man?"
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.960]   He was like, "Hey, do y'all wanna go on some harder rapids?"
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.200]   I'm like, "What are you gonna say, no?"
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.280]   We were like, "Of course, man, give us all you got."
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.120]   And then he gets amped.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.240]   He's like, "Dude, I'd never get to do this.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.120]   "It's gonna be crazy."
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.380]   And then he looks up at me and he was like,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.000]   "Hey, man, when we hit that whitewater, I'm looking at you.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.620]   "And I'm gonna tell you like stroke two
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.680]   "and you gotta dig in deep.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.820]   "Everyone's gonna be keying off of you.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.660]   "You got this?"
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.480]   I was like, "I got you."
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.320]   And he's like, "All right."
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.160]   So he's getting ready.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.560]   And I remember as soon as we hit these rapids,
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.600]   he yelled, "Stroke two!"
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.220]   And as soon as he does,
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.660]   it feels like someone's lit a fire in my shorts.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.320]   So he yelled, "Stroke two!"
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.440]   Right when I yell, "It burns!"
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.720]   And so we hit the rapids.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.800]   I throw my oar down and start scooping water into my lap.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.320]   And he's like, "What are you doing?"
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.480]   I'm like, "Make it stop!"
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.440]   And we went into the rapids sideways.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.280]   It was chaos.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.680]   He was very upset with me.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.480]   No complimentary photo afterwards.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.140]   But I remember as I was changing,
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.860]   I took the wetsuit off and my shorts were frayed
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.060]   like an incredible hole.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.600]   I was like, "Man, what is going on?"
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.620]   And then finally it struck me.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.780]   I looked at my brother and I said,
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.240]   "Hey, man, will you pop the trunk of your car?"
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.000]   And he did.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.700]   And sure enough, there was an old car battery in the back.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.860]   And battery acid had leaked into my bag.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.000]   Now, if that's never happened to you before,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.520]   battery acid doesn't necessarily eat all the clothes.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   What it does is it soaks into every fiber and weakens them.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.260]   So that over the course of the next several days,
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.280]   as I would button a shirt, a chunk would rip off.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.580]   As I would pull on socks, I'd rip the top off.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.760]   Because this substance had soaked every fiber
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.120]   and weakened them so that when it was time for them to move,
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.820]   they disintegrated.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.560]   Now, why do I mention that?
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.240]   Because I think there are forces today
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.880]   that have soaked into our mentality as a culture,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.420]   that have weakened every fiber,
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.460]   and we are disintegrating.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.900]   And our relationship with God,
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.660]   and our relationship to ourselves,
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.500]   and our relationship to other people, and it's a problem.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.140]   Sun Tzu wrote the book "Art of War" centuries ago
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.180]   about the seminal book on warfare.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.500]   And what's interesting about "The Art of War"
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.940]   is there's very little about what happens
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.620]   in the actual battlefield.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.180]   Much of the book is about how to defeat your enemy
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.940]   before you even line up at the battle lines.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.540]   And one of the pieces of information he says
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.340]   is, "Man, when you're working against a kingdom
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.660]   "with superior power, what you have to do is,
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.260]   "one, you wanna distract them
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.060]   "so allure them with sexual activity or with treasure.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.660]   "And then you wanna send spies among the camp
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.180]   "to sow disinformation, to breed distrust,
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.020]   "and so that as there's distrust,
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.480]   "they will disintegrate within their own kingdom,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.540]   "and so they'll be weakened
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.140]   "when the time of battle comes, they're not ready."
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.740]   What's fascinating was he wrote that centuries ago,
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.260]   but I was talking with leaders in DC where I live now,
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.500]   and that playbook has been run by Russia
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.540]   against the United States.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.060]   You know, over the last few years,
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.060]   they was like, "Yeah, that's what we're going to do.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.660]   "Let's flood the internet with all kinds of disinformation
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.780]   "to distort your view of reality."
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.540]   And what's interesting is even among Russian troll farms,
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.820]   they found that they were actually organizing events
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.060]   that took place in America during our election cycle.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.360]   And some of those events were right-wing events,
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.900]   and some of them were left-wing events.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.620]   And what was interesting is the FBI agent
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.760]   who was interviewed by Congress said,
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.580]   "Well, wait a minute, they were organizing
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.600]   "left and right-wing events?
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.540]   "What side were they trying to win?"
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.860]   And the FBI agent said, "No, they weren't picking a side.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.940]   "They just wanted to make us tear each other apart.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.740]   "The goal was disinformation to breed distrust,
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.380]   "so we'll disintegrate.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.540]   "Why size up against us if I can get you to destroy yourself?"
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.900]   Now, here's the interesting thing is
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.060]   I'm actually not that worried about Russia right now.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.340]   I can't solve anything with that,
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.340]   and I'm not really worried about
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.900]   what they're saying to you politically,
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.280]   but what's interesting to me is before Russia ran this play,
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.400]   before Sun Tzu ran this play, the devils ran this play.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.780]   You look at Genesis chapter three, and what's he doing?
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.540]   Distrust, did God really say, "Eve, hey, Eve,
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.620]   "just make an observation.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.180]   "It seems like the God that you worship
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.900]   "is holding out on you.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.380]   "It seems like your allegiance to him
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.580]   "is costing you some experiences, Eve, I don't know,
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.080]   "but something about it says
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.440]   "that he's trying to steal real life from you."
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.120]   And he begins to sow distrust,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.820]   so she will disintegrate from God.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.580]   And then once he separated us from the head,
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.380]   what's Genesis chapter four?
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.180]   God warns Cain, "Sin is crouching at your door.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.480]   "It wants to devour you, but rather than make war on sin,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.940]   "Cain makes war on his brother, and he kills him."
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.260]   And I look at our culture today,
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.940]   and I think there are forces that are calling us
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.460]   to disintegrate from God and disintegrate from each other.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.460]   Why take you head on?
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.380]   I don't have to.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.280]   I just get you to tear yourself apart.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.740]   And my concern is for us in the middle of a culture
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.380]   a country, a society that distrusts each other
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.420]   and is disintegrating or ripping apart at the seams.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.860]   My question that I'm burdened with is,
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.640]   does the church have an answer?
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.820]   What do we say?
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.140]   Does our message have any bearing on a culture in crisis?
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.780]   'Cause I can't fix America,
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.660]   and we don't need to pontificate about that,
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.580]   but I'm very concerned about who is the church
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.240]   in the middle of a difficult day.
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.740]   And what I love about this passage in Ephesians
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.780]   is Paul is gonna show us, hey, there's the problem,
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.180]   and here's the depths underneath our problem,
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.940]   but then he's gonna lead us to the great physician
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.300]   and to see the answer.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.620]   And the answer is not something you do.
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.740]   What Paul is gonna show us is what Christ has done.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.500]   As he's watched the enemy rip apart his people,
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.220]   Christ comes to act decisively.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.700]   And we're gonna get to see the movement of Christ,
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.980]   how he handled the unraveling individually,
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.700]   and how he handled it corporately.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.780]   And then we're gonna see how we participate in it.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.940]   Sound good?
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.340]   So it's a lot of scripture,
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.500]   and we won't necessarily get into the details of all of it,
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.820]   but I wanna fly over what he's done.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.660]   And he starts with how he's helped you individually.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.420]   And you see in Ephesians 2, it starts with,
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.820]   "And you were dead."
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.260]   That Paul looks at our dislocation from God as human beings.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.540]   And he said, "We've been so severed from the author of life
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.700]   "that when he tries to find a metaphor for it,
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.900]   "he goes to the morgue."
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.160]   You are so distant from God,
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.040]   the best description of your spiritual state is a graveyard.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.060]   And he says, "And we were dead in our trespasses and sins."
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.820]   Trespass means you went someplace
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.700]   you were never meant to go.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.180]   And sin means you became something
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.260]   you were never meant to be.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260]   The Bible says all of us have sinned
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.820]   and fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.860]   God made us to be something glorious,
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.180]   but there's something wrong with us.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.700]   I'm in spiritual conversations all the time with people,
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.060]   and you say, "How?"
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.180]   'Cause I'm a pastor.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.340]   People ask, "What do you do for a living?"
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.700]   I say, "I'm a pastor,"
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.200]   which either destroys the conversation immediately,
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.580]   or they start asking questions.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.100]   And you know what's fascinating?
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.940]   Is I tell all of them,
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.180]   "Though you're beautiful in the image of God,
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.340]   "you're desperately broken."
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.140]   And no one ever disagrees.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.440]   They're not like, "Well, Ben, I don't know.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.980]   "I mean, let me push back on that."
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.240]   I see skies of blue and clouds of white.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.660]   I think to myself, "What a wonderful world."
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.500]   No one says that.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.100]   I say, "We're all broken."
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.920]   They're like, "Right?"
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.600]   And they start giving me examples.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.040]   And I say, "And you're broken."
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.120]   And no one pushes back on that.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.960]   They say, "You're right.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.400]   "I don't even understand what I do.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.520]   "We all know something's wrong with us,
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.800]   "but we sometimes misdiagnose the need.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.320]   "Maybe I just need to lose a little weight,
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.440]   "maybe gain a little weight,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.720]   "maybe read a self-help book."
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.700]   And Paul says, "No, man, if you got an upset tummy,
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.660]   "you need Tums.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.480]   "If you got a broken leg, you need surgery.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.520]   "If you're dead, you need a miracle."
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.700]   And the problem's deeper.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.540]   The disintegration is further.
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.700]   You're not alive.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.200]   In which you walked following the course of the world,
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.120]   he said, "There's a social element to our sin.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.340]   "There's a sense of when you get all sinners together,
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.480]   "more sin begins to mix into each other
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.600]   "and integrate and bump into some very ugly ways."
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.880]   Whenever you look historically at genocides,
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.420]   people perpetrating enormous evil,
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.080]   exterminating millions of people like in Nazi Germany.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.920]   Afterwards, in the interviews of people
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.160]   that were just normal people
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.940]   who in various ways participated,
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.740]   they would ask them, "How could you participate
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.520]   "in something you knew was morally wrong?"
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.840]   And over and over again, the reports come back,
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.520]   because everyone was doing it.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.520]   You've all read about the Ash Conformity Experiment
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.640]   where they did tests on college students.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.020]   They would show them pictures,
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.080]   which line is the longest, A, B, or C,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.520]   and A was clearly the right answer.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.080]   But the trick on the test was that everyone was in on it
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.240]   in the room except one kid,
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.080]   and so everyone in the room would clearly pick a shorter one.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.120]   And you'd watch these kids,
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.400]   if you've never watched the videos,
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.520]   look around like, "What?
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.480]   "No, it's A, right guys, right guys, nobody?"
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.620]   And over time, as that consistently happened,
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.140]   you'd watch them slump in their chair
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.660]   and look down, look exhausted,
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.500]   until finally 75% of them would give answers
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.540]   they knew were wrong.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.260]   Which circle's red?
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.220]   Oh, the blue one.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:47.860]   The push of peer pressure so strong,
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.540]   some good self-wisdom you could have
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.900]   is knowing how it gets you.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.500]   We followed the Prince of the Power of the Air.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.260]   There's a spiritual element to it.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.740]   I read two books a few years ago,
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.260]   people who came to believe in God,
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.160]   not because they contemplated the beauty of the world,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.500]   but because they saw the darkness in it.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.100]   And it was more than just biology to them.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.500]   There's something dehumanizing us
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.600]   that lets us be so inhumane to each other.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.680]   And then there's a personal element,
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.100]   among whom we all lived with the passions of our flesh,
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.340]   carrying out the desires of the body, that's the impulse.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.860]   I wanted to see that, so I clicked on it.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.340]   I wanted to touch that, so I did it.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.380]   It's the impulse and the desires of the mind.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.100]   I thought about it.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.820]   I knew that would hurt that person's feelings,
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.160]   and I posted it anyway.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.060]   Some of it's impulsive, some of it's deliberate,
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.900]   but all of it is death, and we are by nature
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.700]   children of wrath like the rest of mankind.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.500]   God is furious when he sees what we've done with the world,
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.620]   and I don't blame him.
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.580]   And you know, in centuries in the past,
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.960]   or centuries years ago, I remember it was kind of awkward
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.300]   to talk about wrath.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.920]   I think people get wrath now.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.720]   It's the proper response to injustice.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.780]   Like I remember for me, when I was a little kid,
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.220]   going with my father to visit my grandma in the hospital,
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.300]   and, or in this nursing home, rather,
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.380]   and we showed up and we heard screaming
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.660]   when we walked through the door.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.100]   And I remember when we turned the corner,
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.500]   we saw the screaming was coming from my grandma.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.220]   They had tied her to a chair in the hallway and left her,
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.020]   and she was slumped down and she was screaming, it hurts.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.740]   I'll never forget as a young man, looking at my father,
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.540]   who was a gentle man, never yelled,
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.620]   but I looked at his face and I saw his arms
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.100]   and I saw wrath.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.220]   I saw fury in that man, because you had one job,
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.540]   take care of her, and you didn't do it.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.700]   You did the opposite of that.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.660]   And who are you mad at?
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.460]   The person who tied her to the chair,
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.100]   or all the people who walked down the hall in indifference?
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.780]   Both.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.740]   And God looks down at the earth he gave us.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.580]   Can you imagine if you had an estate to hand to people
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:59.100]   and they abused a third of them and misused the funds?
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.060]   You'd be furious.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.820]   And God looks at the world and said, man,
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.980]   I called you to love each other
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.180]   and look what you've done to each other.
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.060]   He's furious at it.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:11.220]   And we're all children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.580]   And I know some of us in here say, Ben, I'm not that bad.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.780]   And let me tell you something.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.380]   There's three dead people that Jesus raised
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.820]   from the dead in the gospels.
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.740]   Jairus' daughter that had died minutes before Jesus arrived.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.180]   The young man who Jesus stopped his funeral,
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.060]   literally stopped the funeral beer
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.900]   and raised him from the dead.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.500]   And Lazarus, who Jesus waited for days
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.300]   before he raised him from the dead.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.380]   All three of them, he raised from the dead.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.300]   The little girl probably looked like she was sleeping,
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.220]   probably still warm.
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.580]   She had just been dead for minutes.
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.060]   Young man had probably been dead a day.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.660]   Body was probably already stiff.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.700]   Lazarus had been in the tomb for days.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.140]   So when Jesus showed up, he said, roll the stone away.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.340]   Mary and Martha went, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus, hey,
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.340]   he's gonna stink.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:02.380]   That's the stench of decomposition.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.380]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.740]   All three of them, very different.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.340]   Warm, a little stiff, stench.
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.740]   But what did they have in common?
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.780]   They're all dead.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.780]   It wasn't that he was all dead and she was mostly dead.
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:18.820]   No, they're all dead.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.140]   Just the manifestation of that death looked different.
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.340]   So some of us may say, man, I'm not as bad as that guy.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.540]   I don't stink like that person.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.980]   You're right, but you're still dead.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.300]   Like the rest of humanity.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.380]   We're all in a difficult place.
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.300]   And unless God does something about it, we can't get out.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.740]   I've told this story a lot in here, but it bears repeating.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.820]   When I was a child, my grandmother had a pool
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.900]   in her backyard that years before had been emptied of water,
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.980]   emptied of pool water.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.260]   Over the course of years, it had filled with rainwater
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.860]   and trees had fallen in it, grass.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.300]   There were snakes in there and frogs.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.580]   And when you're a little kid with a vivid imagination,
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.020]   all things evil in the world.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.980]   So if you have a grandma with a pool of evil
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.580]   in the backyard, what do you do?
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.380]   You play on the edge of it.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.380]   That's what my brother and I would do.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.300]   We'd just go walk in the edge.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.940]   We were like, I can't even stand it.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.380]   All right, walk along.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.100]   Until one day I slipped and I fell in.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.380]   And at that moment, it dawned on me immediately.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.900]   I have to get out of this situation.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.140]   So I waded over to the shallow end.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.900]   I began to run as fast as I could.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.340]   And I went for the leap to try to get myself out.
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.740]   I didn't come close.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.500]   I don't know who dug out that pool, but he was motivated.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.820]   I remember I looked up at my brother,
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.940]   who's just a year older than me.
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.780]   And I'm like, "Ugh."
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.620]   And he's like, "Ugh."
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.440]   And I'm like, "Ugh!"
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.700]   'Cause I realized I can't get out and he can't help me.
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.020]   So I did the only thing that was available to me
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.580]   at the time, I started crying.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:55.660]   And I remember as a little five-year-old,
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.860]   I'm crying in a pretty terrifying place to me.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.660]   And as I'm doing that, I look through the fence
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.780]   and I see a guy that's maybe college age.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.820]   And I see him right as he hears me crying.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.860]   And I watch him drop whatever gardening tool he had.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.060]   And he just started to run.
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.700]   And I remember when he got to that fence,
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.500]   he just leapt it all in one move.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.900]   It was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.340]   And we're all like, "Oh, okay, that was amazing."
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.180]   And he dove into that pool with me and he drew me out.
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.420]   It was one of my clearest memories as a child.
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.820]   I remember being a little kid, him leaning over
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.220]   and looking into my face and saying, "Are you okay, son?"
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.540]   And I couldn't answer him.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:44.420]   I was awestruck by the one who would dive into my chaos
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.060]   to set me free.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.540]   And Paul here says, "You were dead,
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:55.860]   but God, being rich in mercy,
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.060]   because of the great love with which he loved us."
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.020]   Not 'cause of what you did,
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.940]   but because of what is housed in him,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.260]   because of that great love, even when you were dead,
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.660]   he made you alive with Christ.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.660]   By grace, you've been saved.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.300]   And he raised us with him and seated us with him
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.580]   in the heavenly places.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.300]   The Bible is not about making bad people good.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.540]   It's about making dead people alive.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:25.900]   That Jesus Christ united you in his love.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.460]   He saw the disintegration of our relationship with God
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.980]   and Jesus Christ reweaved that relationship.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.820]   How did he do it?
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.220]   'Cause there's a vertical beam to this cross.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.460]   He took down the thread of love
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.420]   and said, "I'm binding you with me."
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.900]   That's what's so great about the language.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.980]   Did you notice three times, "With him, with him, with him."
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.460]   You were dead, dead, dead in Adam,
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.060]   but you are now raised with me and seated with me,
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.540]   alive with me, knit together with Christ.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.580]   You have a future and a hope in him
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.220]   because it's by grace, his kindness and compassion,
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.580]   you've been rescued.
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.700]   Not a result of work so that nobody can boast.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.100]   This is our great message.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.380]   This is the hope of the world
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.300]   that we've been rescued by a God
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.380]   who has united us with his love.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.780]   Not because of what you've done,
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.460]   but because of what he did.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.740]   So that in the ages to come,
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.260]   we can be a trophy of his grace,
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.060]   the kind of love that could change you from the inside out
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.020]   and make you in verse 10, his workmanship.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.780]   Created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.660]   which God has prepared for you beforehand,
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.180]   that you would walk in him.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.140]   In an anxious and fractured day,
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.780]   he has made you something new.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.100]   There's a dignity and a stability to this.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.500]   It's fascinating.
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.900]   Michelangelo's David,
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.820]   one of the most famous statues in the world.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.940]   And if you've never gone to see it,
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.540]   you'll wait for hours in line
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.140]   with people from around the world
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.060]   to go into a museum
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.140]   that really doesn't have much else except David.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.780]   The whole museum was built for that statue.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.700]   But what most people don't know is
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.300]   that statue was initially a discarded stone.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.300]   Many other artists had passed it by.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.220]   And then Michelangelo chose it, carved it,
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.940]   and made one of the greatest masterpieces
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.060]   humanity's ever produced.
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.460]   It's insane if you've never looked at it.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.500]   You expect this marble to move.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.380]   It's a lifelike.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.140]   Now, if stone could think,
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:26.540]   it would be dumb for David to stand up there and think,
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.380]   I'm just a discarded stone.
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.620]   So many have passed over me
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.820]   because I'm flawed deep inside.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:44.460]   You'd say, yeah, all that's true.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.540]   But then the master put his hand on you
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.140]   and he's made you something else.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:55.180]   But it'd be equally stupid for David to stand there and say,
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.500]   I am David.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.340]   Drink it in.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.340]   I carved myself out of that stone.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.980]   I chiseled these abs.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.180]   You'd say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.980]   Now, you are impressive, but you didn't do that.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.380]   You're something beautiful
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.220]   because the master put his hands to you.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.140]   You see the beauty of the gospel?
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.460]   It makes us humble and confident at the same time.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.980]   That you can come and say, man, I am something great.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.940]   You're not destined by your flaws.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.460]   They don't have to determine your future.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.100]   You've been made something else.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:33.940]   Why?
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.660]   Because the master knit you together with him.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.980]   You are something else.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.820]   You've been united with him in love.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.660]   You see it?
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.220]   And he set out your itinerary
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.100]   that we would now step into good works
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.380]   that he's prepared for us.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.220]   Now, most people when they preach stop here
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.620]   because 10 verses is a lot and that's a good place to stop.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.340]   Paul doesn't and so we don't either.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:03.700]   Paul goes from what's a really good landing point.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.060]   You're a masterpiece and bring out the band
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.220]   and we sing about how a masterpiece I am.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.420]   Paul goes back down and says,
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.140]   therefore in light of this,
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.740]   remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.980]   Gentile is the word ethnos.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.380]   It's the non-Jewish people in the audience.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.100]   He looks at everyone from the nations
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.300]   that are diverse ethnically
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.780]   and he brings up a source of tension.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:34.420]   He says, therefore remember that one time you Gentiles
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.580]   in the flesh and not just a source of tension
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.540]   called the uncircumcision by what is called
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.540]   the circumcision.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.500]   Now that's awkward.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.220]   Why does he bring up whether or not you're circumcised?
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.260]   That's weird and who would call you that?
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.700]   Well, for the Jewish people,
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.300]   circumcision was a sign of a covenant with God
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.380]   that God has bound himself with us
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.460]   and they were meant to be a kingdom of priests
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.260]   helping other people know the God
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.100]   who had chosen them by his grace.
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.500]   But rather than using that graceful position to love others,
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.460]   they were using it to lord over others.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.900]   And he says, so they're looking at you
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.740]   and calling you the uncircumcision,
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.100]   meaning God doesn't like you as much
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.180]   because of the nature of your ethnicity.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.900]   It's a racial slur
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:19.660]   and it's got cultural baggage and religious baggage.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.900]   And Paul brings up a really awkward subject.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.740]   This one's great.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.420]   This is getting weird.
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.180]   The gospel gets me to heaven,
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.020]   but we're ripping each other apart.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.220]   We're not just disintegrated here,
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.900]   we're disintegrated here.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.260]   And does the Bible have anything to say
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.980]   about how we're culturally ripping each other apart
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.660]   because there's all kinds of issues brought up here.
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.620]   And Paul keeps pressing on me and keeps making it weird.
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.420]   Remember that you were separated from Christ.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.700]   You had no messianic hope,
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.620]   alienated from the Commonwealth of Israel.
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.300]   There's some national issues here.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.260]   Strangers to the covenant is a promise.
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.100]   You didn't even know the words of God.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.580]   And so you had no hope of a future
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.700]   without God in the world.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.540]   He's bringing up all these tensions
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.420]   that for the Jewish people,
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.940]   Gentile was an oppressor, I mean,
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.340]   through their whole life,
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.340]   back from Pharaoh to Babylon to Persia to Rome.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.260]   So there were religious implications,
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.620]   but political implications, social implications,
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.740]   religious implications, ethnic ones,
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.940]   all kinds of barriers.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.500]   I know it's hard to imagine a time in history
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.580]   where people were divided along all these lines.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.340]   Just try to imagine by faith.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:36.100]   Do we have a message that has anything to say here?
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:40.940]   But now in Christ Jesus,
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.380]   you who were once far off have been brought near
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.580]   by the blood of Christ.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.180]   For he himself is our peace.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.300]   This isn't internal peace,
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.860]   it's talking about us.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.300]   He's our peace, how?
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.420]   'Cause he broke down in his flesh
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.500]   the dividing wall of hostility
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.020]   by abolishing the law of commandments,
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.260]   expressing ordinances that he might create in himself
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.700]   one new man in place of the two.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.700]   So making peace and might reconcile us both to God
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.340]   in one body through the cross
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.020]   thereby killing the hostility.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.140]   That's the power of the cross.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.300]   I love the way my friend Derwin Gray says it.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.180]   The cross has a vertical beam
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.060]   that I can be reconciled to God.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.860]   And it has a horizontal beam
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.620]   that I can be reconciled to you.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.140]   The cross is so powerful.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.020]   It can make dead people alive.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.660]   And the cross is so powerful.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.660]   It can turn former hostility into family.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.220]   That's the power of the cross.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.900]   That we can be united with God in love.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.620]   And we can be united with each other in love.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.860]   The cross of Jesus Christ is sufficient
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.620]   to make the dead alive and to make enemies into family.
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.700]   It's that powerful.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.660]   How did he do it?
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.020]   Through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.980]   That in the old Jewish temple, there was a wall.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.020]   Jews could come towards the Holy of Holies
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.260]   into the inner sanctum.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.020]   Gentiles could not.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.700]   But he says, Christ didn't just reconcile us to God.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.660]   He broke down that wall, made the two one.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.980]   And now we're reconciled together as one body
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.540]   because of his cross.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.840]   There's level ground at the foot of the cross.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.620]   I remember for me, when I first started as a pastor
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.660]   right out of college, I was involved in a church
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.060]   that did communion where everyone comes down front
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.580]   and you'd get break off a piece of the bread
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.140]   and you'd dip it in the juice and then eat it.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.220]   I had never been a part of a church.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.700]   I wasn't part of the ones that handed out
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.700]   little individual cups of the body of Christ
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.540]   and blood of Christ.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.980]   And he would sort of not look at anyone else
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:35.820]   or make eye contact.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.580]   I'm having a moment with my individually wrapped
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.300]   body of Christ, blood of Christ.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.180]   Y'all stay over there.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.980]   And so it was the first time it was like this communal thing.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.060]   I thought it was weird at first.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:43.900]   I wasn't sure.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.380]   And actually, I don't know if we'll ever go back
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.340]   to sharing bread again.
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.500]   Not up in DC, bleh, spook people.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.020]   But back there, I remember staying up there.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.740]   My job was to hold the bread and say,
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.220]   the body of Christ was broken for you.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.500]   The body of Christ was broken for you.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.340]   That was my job.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.380]   And someone else said, the blood of Christ
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.020]   was shed for you.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:06.000]   I remember doing that and I remember this old man
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.900]   coming down front.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.460]   This old man had done a lot of impressive things.
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.060]   I knew his story, but he still needed this.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.860]   I told him, the body of Christ has been broken for you.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.220]   Then I remember this little girl walked up,
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.180]   had to kneel down.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.580]   Like, and the body of Christ was broken for you.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.940]   I watched this sweet old Hispanic grandma come up.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.660]   She said, the body of Christ is broken for you.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.660]   Saw a strong young black man come up.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.140]   Body of Christ is broken for you.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.980]   I stood there and I was getting overwhelmed by it.
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.020]   I'm like, is there something sufficient
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.180]   to unite us together in a divided day?
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.540]   Can something reweave the fabric
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.460]   that's being disintegrated in society?
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.140]   Yes, it's not something new, it's something old.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.780]   It worked back then, it works now.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.460]   That the cross kills the hostility,
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.460]   that we can be united in love with him
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.380]   and united in love with each other.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.860]   That's the possibility open to us.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.260]   For through him, we both have access in one spirit
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.140]   to the Father, which is beautiful, but not easy.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.900]   So chapter three, Paul takes an aside
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.940]   and talks about how God called him to the Gentiles.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.740]   And then he gets back on track 'cause he said,
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.180]   hey, I've been called you to walk
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.220]   in these good works that he called you to walk in.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.060]   And he picks that up in chapter four, verse one.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.220]   He says, I therefore, as a prisoner urge you,
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.780]   walk in a manner worthy of the calling
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.220]   with which you've been called.
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.500]   With all humility and gentleness and patience,
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.620]   bearing with one another in love,
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.620]   eager to maintain the unity of the spirit
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.300]   and the bond of peace.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:44.500]   He says, man, now that God has reconciled you to himself,
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.100]   I want you to walk in good works.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.700]   And he says, what are they?
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.060]   He said, well, he's taking people who are very different.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.860]   And I want you to walk in a manner worthy of the gospel.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:52.980]   What is that?
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.020]   I want you to bear with one another.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.540]   In the Greek, that means put up with each other.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.380]   Which you think he would say something more impressive.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.700]   Christ bled out a drops of blood, so go to the nations.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.580]   Now, what does he say?
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.060]   Christ bled out for you, so what?
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.700]   So put up with each, just put up with each other.
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:16.700]   Be gentle, be patient, bear with each other
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.740]   because you'll misunderstand each other constantly.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.860]   But be eager to maintain the unity of the spirit
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:26.700]   and the bond of peace.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.060]   Does that describe you at all?
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:31.100]   We put your social media up on the screen.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.460]   Would it look like eagerness to maintain the unity
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.980]   of the spirit and the bond of peace?
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.940]   There's a lot of motivations in the world to tear us apart.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.940]   And there's real issues and real division.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.180]   But we have the possibility of being woven together
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.220]   to bear with one another in love.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.060]   Why?
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.780]   Because we have the inexhaustible resource of God's love.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.300]   My wife and I love each other.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.260]   And it's pretty amazing that you can love somebody
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.540]   and you build this family that didn't exist before.
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.580]   And that the outworking of that love
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.900]   can actually produce people.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.860]   Don't go too deep into the metaphor, but it's pretty fun.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.940]   So, but you look and when you bring these humans
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.660]   into the world, you're like, we built this relationship
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.220]   and you are a product of our love for each other.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.460]   That's so crazy.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.660]   And I remember when my daughter Sparrow was born,
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:27.780]   the instant she was born, she was ours, mine,
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.140]   forever loved by me.
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:35.140]   But she was also instantly sister to Hannah
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.940]   and one of the greatest hopes as parents
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.340]   that we plead with them is get along.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:52.300]   Let this love transfer here, not just here, but here.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:57.260]   I want it to move amongst each other.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.420]   Can we do that?
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:02.180]   Is it possible to be united with him in love
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.460]   and united with each other,
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.820]   bearing with one another in love,
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.980]   eager to maintain the unity of the spirit
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.060]   and the bond of peace?
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.260]   That what the spirit procured, we preserve.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.740]   What Christ purchased, we preserve.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.940]   We fight for this unity because the world needs to see it.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.780]   And let me tell you something,
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.020]   if I can get in your business a little bit.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.620]   Today, if you're millennial or Gen Z, statistically speaking,
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.180]   depending on how the question's asked,
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.300]   somewhere between 25 to 35% of your generations
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.060]   say they're unaffiliated with any religion.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.300]   Yet interestingly, in the same surveys,
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.620]   when they're asked, how often do you pray
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.180]   and do you believe in heaven, hell, and miracles,
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.060]   the same number roughly as previous generations
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.180]   indicate that they do.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.580]   It's confusing.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.660]   So wait a minute, you're less religious,
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.260]   but you roughly believe the same things
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.700]   and pray about the same amount of time?
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.820]   What's the difference?
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.300]   Well, the difference is that word unaffiliated.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.860]   It means not part of a group.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.700]   And what you see happening a lot in the world today
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.660]   is not that I'm less interested in spirituality
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.020]   or less pursuing of spirituality,
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.140]   it's just that I'm less interested
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.580]   in the affiliations with other people.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.260]   Dr. Gene Twenge did a study on it
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.860]   on your generations and has found that
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.420]   where a sense of individualism is high,
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:17.500]   the prioritizing of self, religious involvement is low
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.020]   because it involves commitment to a group.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.380]   So you see the rise of this language,
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.060]   I'm spiritual, but not religious.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:23.900]   What does it mean?
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.100]   It means I wanna acknowledge there's a spiritual world.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.940]   I believe there's more than just biology.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.700]   I wanna be a part of something out there,
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.780]   but I don't want the hassle of you.
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.500]   And so you see, it's not an anti-spiritual movement
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.540]   in your generation, it's anti-social.
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.660]   It's I wanna love God,
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.780]   but I don't want the hassle of you people.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.660]   And listen, I'm not giving you a hard time
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.540]   because this is a trend in America you were born up to.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.820]   The number of people that you can call in a crisis
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.420]   has been decreasing in America since the 1950s.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.300]   So you're part of an anti-social movement
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.500]   that's been happening in America for a long time.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.380]   As our square footage of our homes has grown,
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.820]   the square footage of our friendship groups have shrunk.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.540]   And a lot of that is because of these phones
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.420]   and you didn't make them,
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.260]   they were put in your hand as babies.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.780]   But the more we're brought onto this,
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.580]   you see a marked decrease in empathy in your generations
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.860]   because I can be rude to you
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.340]   and not have to look at the pain in your face.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.060]   And so there's an anti-social movement in society,
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.780]   but it's interesting, Huffington Post,
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:22.820]   which is by no means a conservative or religious publication
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.580]   released a study by UCLA,
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.380]   which is in no way a religious institution,
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.780]   but they study college students, your generation,
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.220]   over 200 universities,
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.060]   and they were looking for what are the major trends
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.380]   in college students over the decades.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.940]   And do you know what they found the major trends are?
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.140]   College students are less religious,
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.220]   not surprising, we just said that.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.300]   And it says, but college students are also more lonely,
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.140]   depressed, and stressed than any generation previously,
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.060]   by a wide margin.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.140]   And so the third trend they're seeing
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.140]   is they need to offer more drug treatment
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.580]   because addiction is an intimacy disorder.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.740]   If I can't find my needs met with another human being,
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.740]   then I go to try to regulate my chemicals of the substance.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.180]   You see?
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.020]   And there's an increasing amount of responsibility
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.860]   for colleges to try to police sexual violence.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.820]   As you see among your generation,
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.620]   there's been not a lack of interest in spirituality,
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.540]   but a weakening of the fabric socially.
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.820]   And what's it done?
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.900]   You've all seen that study.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.180]   Every pastor's quoted it.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.460]   So let me just get it out of the way.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.820]   They did a study recently in Barna, right?
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.820]   Across America throughout the pandemic,
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.060]   everyone's mental health went down, except one group.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.740]   Those who went to church on a weekly basis,
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.500]   not every now and again, weekly,
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.420]   said, I'm gonna prioritize what Christ purchased.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.860]   I'm united with Him, so I'm united with us.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.420]   And what the statistics are showing us
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.140]   is what Genesis says is haunting.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.100]   It's not good for a man to be alone.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.700]   One of the greatest gifts God has given us is us.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.340]   I'm united with Him.
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.140]   And then he says, but I didn't stop there.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.260]   I also united you with us.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.540]   So be eager to maintain this bond of unity
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.380]   and this bond of the Spirit in peace,
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.540]   because it's difficult, but it's worth it and you need it.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.700]   So let me give you two implications before we close.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.140]   'Cause some of you are like, Ben, why would I bother?
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.740]   Like, why do I wanna fight for this?
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.860]   Why do I wanna fight for unity?
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.500]   Like, I have my friendship group.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.220]   All I need is a couple buddies
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.580]   and some podcasts and some books and I'm good.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.580]   Jesus here is talking about,
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.060]   I made strangers and enemies into family.
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.060]   Why?
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.860]   Because the unity of diversity brings glory.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.380]   It does.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.700]   Give you a simple example.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.620]   If I came to you and said,
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.340]   hey man, you gotta listen to this song.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.300]   And you said, why?
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.140]   And I was like, dude, it is a hit
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.740]   among 13 year old white girls.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.740]   They love it.
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.660]   You probably don't care.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.660]   Like, dude, I wanna hear this song.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.900]   But if I said to you, dude, you gotta hear this song.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.740]   You're like, why?
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.900]   Because this is the number one song
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.940]   in every country on planet earth.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.940]   Across age demographics, social economic boundaries,
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.700]   this song is the number one song in the minds and hearts
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.180]   of people from all different ethnicities and ages
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.660]   and social and economic backgrounds,
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.740]   all across the planet, all keen off this song.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.900]   You'd go, play me the song.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.980]   What could possibly unite people like that?
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.300]   The unity of diversity brings glory.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.220]   I gotta hear it.
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.700]   If I said, try this restaurant.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.460]   It's a hit with the over 75 set.
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.780]   I mean, the grandparents love it.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.100]   You're probably not gonna go.
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.100]   But if I say everyone wants to go there,
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.460]   you wanna know what they're serving.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.380]   The unity of diversity brings glory.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.340]   It is no great glory for you to love your friends.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.180]   That's what Jesus said.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.180]   He said, love your enemies.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.220]   Pray for those who persecute you.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.420]   He said, you love your friends?
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.940]   Even the sinners do that.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.580]   Even Hitler probably had friends.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.420]   I love my friends.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.380]   Who cares?
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.860]   But people see the glory of God
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.740]   when they see people across boundaries,
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.940]   when they see love explode past the expected banks,
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:56.900]   it brings glory.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.580]   When they walk into a church building
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.620]   and they see you all here,
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.700]   and say, hey, there's old people here and young people here.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.340]   Hey, there's black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Latino.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.380]   Everybody's here.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.580]   What could do that?
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.780]   There's only two entities in America,
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.580]   the Department of Motor Vehicles.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.220]   And there's something to it.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.820]   Everyone knows they're guilty.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.460]   We all stand condemned.
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.060]   And the church of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.580]   And this one's way more fun.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:32.140]   (congregation applauding)
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.540]   That people are meant to walk in among us
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.620]   and say, what can do this?
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.820]   What could unite a people like this?
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.220]   What could do this?
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.660]   We say the cross is that powerful,
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.300]   that it not only brings the dead to life,
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.820]   it makes former enemies, it makes them family.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:53.580]   So we do it for his glory and we do it for his good.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.460]   We do it for our good.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.580]   But we need us.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:00.500]   It's interesting, man, 'cause you all believe this anyway.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.980]   I mean, you look in like the Iron Man movie
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.340]   made maybe $300 million.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.060]   The Avengers made multiple billion.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.180]   Would it be billion dollars, right?
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.180]   Why?
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.980]   Because we wanna see people who are formerly disparate
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.540]   come together to solve a problem, right?
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.700]   How many times have you watched that movie?
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.900]   Over and over again.
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.780]   Lord of the Rings and the Avengers
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.220]   and Justice League, no, it's good.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.140]   But you go to those movies all the time.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.580]   I wanna see people who have no business getting along
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.860]   and don't really like each other
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.660]   suddenly have a purpose bigger than themselves
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.620]   that they have to unite about
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.780]   and they overcome their differences
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.140]   and found that our unity doesn't actually detract from me.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.580]   Actually, as I work through our differences,
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.980]   it enriches me 'cause I get to be a part
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.340]   of something bigger than myself.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.780]   And we go, yes, that's right.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.140]   That is just stealing a little piece
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.220]   of what Jesus is doing right.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:44.060]   Man, I don't wanna do that
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:44.980]   'cause I don't get along with that guy.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.020]   I don't understand him.
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.500]   You want this.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.940]   You're built for this.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.420]   It's for God's glory and it's for your good.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.340]   I love it.
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.460]   We didn't get a chance to read it,
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.540]   but he says, "When we speak the truth to one another in love,
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.300]   "we will in all things grow into the head."
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.980]   That is we lean into preserving this unity
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.780]   and speak the truth to each other, you grow.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.900]   This is for your good.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:13.580]   It's interesting, match.com is an old school dating site.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.260]   And they developed an algorithm
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.820]   of you punch in the characteristics that you like
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.180]   and we'll spit out your first date
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.900]   and you guys should get married, you're a match.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.620]   And they found that it like never worked.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.660]   Like people barely ever made it out of the first date.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.860]   And so they hired a guy to understand
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:30.900]   what's wrong with our algorithm.
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.300]   Why does our algorithm work?
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.580]   And what they found was there's nothing wrong
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.260]   with the algorithm.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.540]   The problem is people.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:42.580]   What they say they want and who they marry
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.660]   are so wildly disparate.
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.500]   There's no correlation.
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.180]   And it's funny when I talk to people that are like,
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.580]   well, Ben, I don't need to go to church.
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.740]   I got my friends, my podcast, my books.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.340]   That betrays the assumption
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:00.900]   that you actually know what you want and you don't.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:05.180]   But the spirit apportions gifts for the common good.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.740]   He scattered them among an us and you need an us.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:13.540]   I had no idea when I was 20 how selfish I was
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.820]   till I got involved at a church
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.980]   and started serving among junior high kids.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.220]   And I would speak and they're not listening.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.420]   And I'm like, why are you not listening to this?
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.260]   This is good.
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.100]   Like, why are you not?
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:23.940]   Other people want to hear this.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.780]   I don't need this.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.620]   I don't need y'all.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.460]   I don't need this.
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:27.740]   And I realized I'm so selfish.
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.220]   I have no idea.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.420]   But I'll never forget the day
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.020]   one of them walked into the church early
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.100]   and asked, how are you doing, man?
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.020]   He was like, fine.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:39.740]   But I knew his parents had just divorced.
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.620]   And I knew he was helping dad move into his apartment
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:44.460]   that week.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.780]   And I asked, how was that?
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:47.820]   He said, it was fine.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.980]   I don't normally talk like this to middle school kids,
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.020]   but I was like, hey man, like,
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:56.580]   I know you're gonna be fine, but it sucks.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.340]   It's okay to say it sucks.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.220]   And he just started crying.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.460]   It fell into my chest and I was holding this kid.
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.020]   And instantly when I was holding him,
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.140]   I thought about all the time it costs me
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.300]   to volunteer among these children.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:14.940]   But I just thought,
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.260]   but there's nothing else I'd rather do with my life.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.660]   And I sat there and I was like,
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:24.060]   I would have never at 23 knelt down in my bedroom
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:24.900]   and thought, God,
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.260]   will you just send me some middle school age boys
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.100]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.340]   to make me in your image?
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.980]   I would have never asked for that.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.820]   Would have never crossed my mind.
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:40.660]   But he wove us together for my good.
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.500]   I had no idea.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.660]   I was a dwarf in prayer till I joined a church
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.500]   where there were old ladies
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.380]   that would just easily pray all night for somebody else.
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.580]   Never experienced that.
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.540]   I moved to a church in the inner city of Denver
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.380]   and lived in it,
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.300]   this wildly diverse church ethnically.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.380]   And so there's all these issues that come up
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.100]   as cultures rub against each other.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.780]   But I watched a church not be scared of that,
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:02.620]   but just like Paul,
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.100]   be willing to bring it up and listen
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:04.940]   and care for each other.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.100]   It was the most beautiful picture
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.740]   of look what's possible in this place.
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.060]   It was an open church.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.580]   In this place, it was an old grocery store
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.540]   that closed down and left the neighborhood
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.100]   because the store decided it's not worth being
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:16.940]   in this neighborhood.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.780]   It got robbed too much.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.100]   And so the church moved in and they used to laugh about it.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.980]   Several of us that used to rob this church
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.660]   are now ministering to the neighborhood
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:25.420]   in Jesus' name in the same building.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:28.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.740]   And I remember being in that church
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.780]   and the front desk was manned by two people
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.420]   who were the best of friends,
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.740]   like little peas in a pod.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.420]   One was this little bitty old white lady
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:41.740]   and one was a big, tall Hispanic man.
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:46.020]   She was old, so she was frail,
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.820]   but he was so gentle with her, helping her around.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:52.260]   And he had come out of a rough lifestyle
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.900]   and had some illnesses of his own.
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:58.300]   She would mother him and remind him to take his pills
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.140]   and all this.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.300]   And you would just watch the way they would talk
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.740]   to each other and you were like,
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:04.540]   it's beautiful that God gave them to each other.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.460]   And I promise you,
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.700]   she never knelt down in her old folks' home
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.820]   or wherever she lived and just said,
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:14.820]   "Lord, I just, I need a huge Hispanic former gang member
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.380]   "in this last chapter of my life."
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:24.060]   I guarantee you, he was never in his room going like,
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.980]   "Lord, I need a white grandma."
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.820]   (congregation laughing)
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.580]   He wasn't asking.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.700]   And let me warn you something.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.580]   If I was the enemy and wanted to destroy you,
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.420]   what would I do?
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.180]   I would make you not prioritize being among us.
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.580]   That's a disinformation, distrust.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.300]   Take real problems, but exacerbate them.
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:47.420]   Take those threads and pick at them
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.740]   and pick at them and pick at them.
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.740]   Keep you apart from each other
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.740]   so you can't hear each other's hearts,
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.340]   you only hear the language.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.020]   Throw volleys of hate on a phone.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.740]   Get this in between your relationships,
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.540]   make it a dividing wall of hostility
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.580]   and disintegrate the church
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.660]   so that when the world is in the darkness,
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.060]   we're already powerless before the fight starts.
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:06.580]   And I wanna warn you,
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.660]   Jesus Christ is reweaving a connection
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.380]   between heaven and earth through his cross.
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.740]   And he's reweaving a connection between us by his cross.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.140]   And I haven't given you much
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.300]   by the way of application of how to do this,
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.060]   but if we bear with one another
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:24.500]   with gentleness and humility and patience,
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.940]   we're not just built into individual Davids.
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.660]   He said, "You're being built together
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.940]   into a temple of the Holy Spirit."
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.380]   The world will see something it desperately needs.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:38.100]   Robert Woodbury did a study
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.900]   on the missionary roots of liberal democracy
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.260]   published in a scientific journal.
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.220]   He wanted to understand the impact of missionaries
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.620]   on developing nations.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.100]   So he did a study over years and he said,
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.860]   "What he found struck him like an atomic bomb."
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:57.660]   He said that, "We found that missionaries,
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.900]   when they entered economically developing nations,"
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.980]   he said, "Wherever Protestant missionaries
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.020]   had a significant presence,
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.660]   those nations are more economically developed,
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.340]   have comparatively better health,
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.340]   have lower infant mortality, have lower corruption,
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.260]   have greater literacy, have higher educational attainment,
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.380]   especially for women,
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.620]   and more robust membership and service."
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.620]   And he said, "To be clear,
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.060]   there were some racist missionaries
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.940]   and self-centered missionaries,
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.340]   but if that was the norm,
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.300]   you would expect to see those negative effects
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.140]   be the average, but the opposite was in place."
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.540]   He said, "Wherever you saw missionaries come,
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:35.700]   you saw a culture elevate."
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.380]   But then he makes the important distinction.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.260]   When I say missionary,
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.180]   I'm talking about conversionary Protestants,
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.580]   which is a title he made up.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:46.180]   But he's trying to explain conversionary means
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:48.720]   they're people who understand you need to be converted.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.820]   You were dead and need to be made alive.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.740]   And Protestant meaning they believe this book
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.980]   is the word of God that tells you about a Jesus Christ
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:58.100]   who came for you to reweave the fabric of a broken society
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.980]   so that you would love God and love each other.
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:03.620]   He said that message, when it lands in a culture,
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.540]   doesn't just change individuals,
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.460]   it actually changes cultures and changes nations.
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.500]   And then this is what he wrote in his conclusion.
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.620]   He said that these missionaries,
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.780]   he said they imposed unjust and destructive practices
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.860]   like opium addiction and slavery and land confiscation,
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.620]   but they didn't set out to be political activists.
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.780]   All this reform came through the back door.
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:31.060]   All these positive outcomes were somewhat unintended,
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:35.080]   which by saying he completely misreads the gospel.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.420]   Because Jesus says, when you make the tree good,
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:41.140]   the fruit will be good.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.020]   He said, it's the weirdest thing.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.780]   People are coming to Christ and nations are rising,
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.500]   but they didn't set out to change nations,
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.460]   they set out to change people.
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.280]   Isn't that weird?
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.200]   And we say, no, not at all, Robert.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:55.580]   When we reweave the broken fabric between God and humanity,
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.260]   he says, this isn't the only fabric of love I'm weaving.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.900]   I wanna weave it across every human boundary too,
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:06.340]   so that when you love each other, cities change,
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.700]   churches change, cultures change, society changes.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.140]   It's possible.
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.900]   We're not too far gone.
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:15.340]   I have great hope for America.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.660]   I have great hope for our nation.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.380]   I have great hope for your generation,
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.340]   but not 'cause you're so great, but because he is.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.740]   So make that decision.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.460]   I'm gonna press into us,
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.380]   not a hypothetical spirituality,
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.700]   but a deep, robust community,
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.700]   that as we rub up against each other, the world sees love.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.180]   They see you at churches.
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.100]   They see you in places like this,
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.180]   and they say, surely God is in their midst,
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.300]   because nothing else makes sense.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.660]   And the light of the world will shine
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.060]   in the darkness through us.
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:43.960]   Lord, let it be.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.400]   So God, thank you,
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:52.100]   that while we were a long way off, you came for us.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.060]   And God, I know there's some people in here
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.700]   that have never put their faith in Jesus.
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:01.660]   And I pray that first part of the sermon
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.060]   would be for them, that they would say,
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.180]   no, I know what I am.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.260]   I know I'm dead, and I keep trying to turn over a new leaf,
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:11.220]   but I need to be resurrected.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:15.900]   And thank you, God, that you sent Christ,
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.300]   that he can renovate hearts from the inside out.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:23.580]   And Lord, I pray there might be some men and women
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.540]   here even tonight that say, I want you.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:28.800]   If you're rescuing, rescue me.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.600]   If you're reweaving the severed fabric
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.300]   between heaven and earth, weave me in.
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:40.460]   You tell him that tonight, friend,
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.020]   and then please tell one of us.
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:46.040]   And then God, for those of us who know you,
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.620]   it's not shocking to watch a culture divide
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:52.340]   of along very common lines, all throughout human stories,
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.720]   we have divided across cultures.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.540]   Decided on socioeconomic boundaries,
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:01.100]   political boundaries, ethnic boundaries, we divide.
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:05.300]   But God, you have done something about that too.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.620]   The cross is so powerful.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.800]   It not only brings the dead to life,
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.900]   it makes enemies into family.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.220]   So I pray, God, in the midst of a culture that's divided,
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.380]   might they see us speak the truth to each other?
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:22.200]   Not hide it, not bury it, but speak it in love,
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:26.260]   with gentleness and humility, with patience,
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:29.560]   bearing with one another, eager to maintain that unity.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.880]   And I pray, God, radiating out of our churches
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.500]   and towns all across this country,
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.340]   people would see, surely God is in their midst.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.180]   What could create a healing like that?
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.740]   What kind of balm could heal the wounds
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.840]   of a nation like that?
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.340]   God, I pray the glory of all that you purchased
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.260]   on the cross would be manifest through the unity
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.320]   we persevere and maintain together.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.360]   Knit us together for your glory,
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.700]   knit us together for our good,
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:02.620]   and may our cities be different because we exist.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:09.640]   May this generation be different
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.540]   because we dare to believe this truth.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.860]   I wanna invite you just to ask Him,
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.660]   what would it look like for me, God,
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.120]   to forgive someone who hurt me,
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.440]   to reach out to someone I've avoided,
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:32.460]   to pray for somebody that I secretly just wanna see fall.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.620]   What if I prayed and asked God to bless me?
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.880]   To not give up when people are a hassle,
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.180]   to press in with a question
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.980]   rather than attack with a statement,
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.000]   ask Him to give you a vision of what it might look like
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.700]   to be the church to each other.
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:57.720]   Let it be.
