[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   [Music]
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Thank you for my friends who are walking faithfully just through all of the junk that's just in our life.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   It's in our heart and we wait for the day where you totally remove it and you free us once and for all.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   But until then, help us to walk honestly and authentically. May we struggle and be anything but liars.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   I pray even now that we would expose in proper settings to brothers and sisters in our life anything that we need to
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   and that we would declare the greatness of our King despite the hypocrisy of our hearts.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Thank you for Jesus, the only one who wasn't a hypocrite. In his name we pray. Amen.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   I like never thought I would work for a church and still think it's like funny that I do at wake up days going,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   "Am I still doing this?" And one of the reasons was I'd never seen authenticity the way that I've seen it here.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   And I've never seen even, I have friends who work at other places and they go, "Yeah, you know, church politics."
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And I always have to go, "I really don't." They say, "Yeah, once you get farther into the leadership of the church,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   you'll just see kind of behind the curtain." And the more that I see, I'll tell you this, and I feel like,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   I don't know how much credibility I have, but whatever that is, I can tell you the more and more that I see here,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   and these guys are not perfect, but the farther in that I see, the more of Christ I see. I really do.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And I feel like I can say that about Todd in a way that he wouldn't be able to say about himself.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   But if that gives you any confidence about a man who is, say, I'm not perfect or any of the elders,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   but who long ago said, "Let's be a community of people who doesn't pretend to be perfect,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   but proclaims that we have a perfect Savior. And let's be anything but liars along this journey.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Let's just be open about where we are. If there's times I don't feel like I need you, even though I know that I do."
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   And so tonight, if you're here for the first time, maybe in church in a long time,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   and maybe you stepped out because you were hurt by someone who wore the name of Christ,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   we'd love to talk to you, and we hate that for you. And we don't promise that it won't hurt here.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   We do promise that we will be diligent to care, to ask for forgiveness if there's areas we need to,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   and to seek to preserve the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   We make every effort to declare that when we are hypocritical, I'm a Christian hypocrite,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   and I have a great Savior. If you don't know that Savior, we'd love to talk to you about Him.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   [Silence]
