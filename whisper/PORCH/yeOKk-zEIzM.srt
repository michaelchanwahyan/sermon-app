1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,880
 - All right, let's go.

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,880
 Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends in Houston.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
 I know you guys have been meeting here.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,480
 I love y'all too.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,800
 Welcome friends in Northwest Fayetteville, Arkansas,

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,600
 and the other 13 live locations.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,520
 I know Fort Worth tonight is also gathering.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,200
 So depending on where you're at,

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,960
 welcome everyone and everybody just tuning in from online.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,160
 It has been a minute and gosh, man,

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,280
 it is good to see you guys.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,800
 And like JD said, some of y'all,

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,400
 you guys got plans after time or something.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,800
 Hey, I'm gonna welcome you to something

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,020
 that happened recently in my life

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,760
 since last time we were all together.

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,040
 I do pretty much the same thing every single day

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,480
 after I get home from work.

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,400
 I go into the house, I kiss my wife, kiss my kids,

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,640
 and then I take our 130 pound Rhodesian Ridgeback on a walk.

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,580
 Now I don't walk and I don't run.

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,920
 So I have a longboard.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,160
 Yes, just like that 14 year old that you grew up with.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,500
 And I take him on the longboard.

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,120
 We have a shock collar.

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,920
 Don't email me, he never gets shocked.

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,000
 He's like a big baby elephant

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,360
 that you gotta take on a walk once a day.

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,720
 And I take him on one lap around the block,

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,800
 get on the longboard, hop on there, no leash.

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,240
 He just follows right behind me.

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,160
 I finish it and then we go inside.

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,280
 A couple days ago I was doing that, got home,

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,280
 took the lap with the dog and I went up to the house

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,520
 and I was about to go inside and I smelled smoke.

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,880
 And you know when you have that experience

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,220
 where you could smell, it was like six o'clock at night,

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,460
 and there's a difference when you smell

40
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,640
 something like grilling steaks.

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
 It smells like hickory, you're like,

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,080
 man, that sounds great.

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,400
 And then we've all smelled what is clearly

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,920
 like something is burning around here,

45
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,840
 like significantly burning.

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,880
 So I begin to go, is somewhere on our house

47
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
 something on fire?

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
 And I begin to look around the outside

49
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,200
 of the perimeter of the house and look through

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,940
 and be like, man, 'cause that's not a good thing.

51
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,120
 Anytime that happens, where is this smell coming from?

52
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,800
 I mean, really strong smell.

53
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,920
 And I get around the house and I don't see anything

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,800
 and so I begin to kind of wonder,

55
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,560
 is there something on with the neighbor's house?

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,440
 And I go over, I'm in my alley,

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,600
 behind my neighbor's house and between my house

58
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,320
 and I see clearly smoke coming up from the backyard.

59
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,560
 And not just like any smoke, like,

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
 oh, maybe they're doing s'mores.

61
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,220
 You know, that's what people do in June.

62
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,600
 Like a thick, white, billowing cloud of smoke.

63
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,520
 Like clearly something is burning over there

64
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,640
 and I'm beginning to go like,

65
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,160
 man, what is possibly going on?

66
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,440
 And I come up to the fence and I didn't wanna just like

67
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
 open their gate and go into their backyard like,

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,080
 hey, it's the neighbors, we're coming over.

69
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,920
 If they were just, I don't know what they could've

70
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,060
 been doing, but I couldn't see.

71
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,180
 So I go up to the fence and I begin to just like

72
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,720
 try to peek over and see what's going on,

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,880
 hoping there's no one like sunbathing nude

74
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,720
 or something going on.

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,000
 And I begin to like look over and which clearly,

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,440
 if they're doing that and they have smoke,

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,320
 they've got more problems than we can talk about here.

78
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,800
 But anyway, so I begin to like try to look at the fence,

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,320
 but it was too tall, it was a really high fence.

80
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,220
 So it was one of those moments where, guys,

81
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,120
 at least you've all experienced this when you were a kid

82
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,360
 and you threw a ball over the fence

83
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,180
 and you had to like hop over, where I'm jumping up

84
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,120
 to try and hold myself for a second just to see

85
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,560
 and I keep jumping up to hold myself,

86
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,120
 hoping that no one's looking out the window

87
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,960
 like who's this psychopath that is jumping over our fence?

88
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,160
 And all I can see is smoke.

89
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,360
 I mean like thick, white smoke.

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,440
 I can't see the fire.

91
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,080
 And 'cause as far as I could get up there,

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,400
 I couldn't see what was down below.

93
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,160
 And so I take the dog, the baby elephant,

94
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,480
 take him back home, put him inside and I'm like,

95
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,120
 hey, talking to my wife, I'm gonna go check on,

96
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,400
 there's something burning in the neighbor's yard.

97
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
 And by the time I got back over there,

98
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,800
 you know, maybe they had seen me jumping over,

99
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,560
 someone had put the fire out.

100
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,920
 And I still never quite figured out exactly

101
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,080
 what was taking place back there.

102
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,360
 But the reason I start there is because in that moment,

103
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,940
 I know that there's a fire that is taking place.

104
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,200
 And fire is not necessarily one of those bad things

105
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,440
 where anytime it's present, you're like,

106
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,800
 hey, this is an emergency,

107
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,400
 we need to make sure that we put that out.

108
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,080
 Fire can be a great thing.

109
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,920
 It's not inherently a bad thing.

110
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,440
 A fire in a fire pit in your backyard can be awesome.

111
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,760
 A fire moving through your property,

112
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,240
 burning the fence or burning your house

113
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,480
 is an incredibly destructive thing.

114
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,440
 But it's not inherently or not always

115
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,880
 necessarily a bad thing.

116
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,880
 It depends on what the source of the fire is,

117
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,240
 on why there's a fire there, on what it's burning.

118
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,480
 What does it have to do with seven deadly sins?

119
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,460
 Tonight, we're gonna talk about a deadly sin

120
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,840
 that is very similar to fire.

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,080
 And that it's not inherently,

122
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,840
 every time it's there, a bad thing.

123
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,840
 There's plenty of times when it's appropriate to be there.

124
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,840
 But if unchecked or if there for the wrong reason

125
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,760
 or expressed in the wrong way,

126
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,120
 just like a fire is incredibly destructive.

127
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,460
 And that seventh deadly sin

128
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,900
 or that one of the deadly sins is anger.

129
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,520
 Anger is one of those things that inside of your life,

130
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,720
 it's not always a wrong thing, there are appropriate times.

131
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,280
 The Bible says God is angry at times in Scripture.

132
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,180
 Specifically at an injustice in our world.

133
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,000
 You can't love someone and not experience anger, right?

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,120
 Like if I love someone and someone is hurting them

135
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,120
 or abusing them, I would rightly feel anger,

136
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,380
 righteous anger towards that person.

137
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,960
 We're told that God feels that.

138
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,080
 There's appropriate times to have anger,

139
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
 it's not always bad.

140
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,920
 And when you look at the news

141
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,360
 and you see what happens with George Floyd,

142
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,600
 you should appropriately feel anger.

143
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,240
 That is wrong, not okay.

144
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,500
 There's appropriate experiences of anger.

145
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,200
 But at the same time,

146
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,640
 there's also not appropriate experiences of anger

147
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,460
 or expressions of anger.

148
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,520
 There's sinful anger that can take place.

149
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,280
 It depends on what the source, what the cause,

150
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,120
 what's taking place.

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,640
 Tonight, we're not talking about righteous anger.

152
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,840
 We're gonna talk about the deadly sin of sinful anger.

153
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,320
 Because I'm like, several,

154
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,760
 or really all of them can be toxic,

155
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,300
 but this one in particular,

156
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,340
 the effects are seen and are rippling

157
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,640
 all throughout our culture

158
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,680
 of anger being experienced

159
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,780
 and not knowing how to express it.

160
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,080
 And what we're about to talk about tonight,

161
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,880
 I promise you this,

162
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,360
 if just Christians would apply the things

163
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,760
 that we're gonna look at,

164
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,060
 myself, you, if you claim to be a follower of Jesus,

165
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,760
 if just us would apply the teaching of Jesus

166
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,120
 on what relates to this, our world would change.

167
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,140
 It's one of the things that it's impossible

168
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,220
 to not look around.

169
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,220
 People are angry about corona.

170
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,460
 People are angry about their job.

171
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,220
 People are angry about the fact that they can't work.

172
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,860
 People are angry about the fact that they are work.

173
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,700
 People are angry about the fact

174
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,220
 that we're streaming or we're meeting right now.

175
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,140
 People are angry about any list of things.

176
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,100
 And oftentimes, sinful anger can grab our hearts,

177
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,940
 and anytime it does, it is devastating,

178
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,960
 and it is destructive.

179
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,260
 And this will destroy your marriage

180
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,420
 if you allow it to.

181
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,900
 It'll destroy your relationships if you allow it to,

182
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,060
 but it doesn't have to.

183
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,820
 So we're gonna look at three things in the Scripture.

184
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,060
 What is the root of anger?

185
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,440
 'Cause I think it'll surprise you.

186
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,900
 And we're gonna look at the results

187
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,060
 over and over the Scripture say,

188
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,720
 if you don't deal with your anger, that will take place.

189
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,880
 And then look at the remedy

190
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,500
 that God uniquely provides in our world,

191
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,540
 unlike any other remedy that our world has to offer.

192
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,820
 So we're gonna look at the roots.

193
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
 If you take notes, the roots, the results, and the remedy.

194
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,340
 The first one, the root of sinful anger.

195
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,340
 Let me ask a few questions before we go in there,

196
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,100
 because the challenge with anger is it kind of masks itself.

197
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,700
 So most people are like, look, I'm not angry,

198
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
 I'm just frustrated.

199
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,300
 I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.

200
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,700
 I'm not angry, and it kind of masks

201
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,580
 behind these little things.

202
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,220
 But here's some ways that you may know that you're angry.

203
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,140
 Is there anyone in your life

204
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,140
 that a part of you hopes that they fail,

205
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,460
 or they suffer?

206
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,100
 You got some anger, bitterness buried in your heart.

207
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,820
 Is there anyone whose name, when you bring them up,

208
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,380
 it makes you upset?

209
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,620
 Thinking about what they did makes you upset.

210
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,500
 Anger and bitterness have taken root.

211
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,740
 Is there anyone who you would avoid in public,

212
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,780
 or you wouldn't wanna go to that party,

213
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,140
 you wouldn't wanna go there or go to that dinner

214
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,820
 if they were around, because if something

215
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,020
 that happened between you, there's anger.

216
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,620
 Is there anyone you're waiting, maybe it's a family member,

217
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,500
 maybe it's a friend, maybe it's an old roommate,

218
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,300
 you're waiting to let back into your life

219
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,460
 'til they apologize and say what they did,

220
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,580
 or pay back for what they did?

221
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,220
 There's anger that's taken place.

222
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,980
 You can't always tell on the outside.

223
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,940
 A lot of times, the most angry people,

224
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,220
 they're just totally internal, and they just replay tapes

225
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,100
 over and over in their head.

226
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,580
 They got these constant kind of battles

227
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,540
 going on in their mind, and they wouldn't think

228
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,020
 of themselves as angry, 'cause they're not

229
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,060
 very vocal about it, but there's anger

230
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,660
 buried in their heart, oftentimes leading them

231
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,500
 to keep those feelings to themselves,

232
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,260
 which only makes it worse.

233
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,000
 So the root of sinful anger, where does it come from?

234
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,620
 Jesus says this in Mark chapter seven, verse 21.

235
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,740
 For it is within and out of a person's heart

236
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,040
 that evil thoughts come.

237
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,700
 Wait a second, thoughts come from your heart?

238
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,820
 Jesus, I think you mean the mind.

239
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,660
 The Bible, over and over, when it talks about the heart

240
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,200
 and the mind, it just kinda talks about the control center,

241
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,780
 the command center of your operating system,

242
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,820
 if you will, of your things.

243
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,300
 When it says hearts, thoughts come out of the hearts.

244
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,060
 Well, what's surprising is what he mentions next.

245
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,500
 Here's the evil thoughts that come out of your heart.

246
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,340
 Sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed,

247
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,500
 malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander,

248
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,180
 arrogance, and folly.

249
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,740
 Wait a second, Jesus, those are all actions.

250
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,680
 What do you mean that those are evil thoughts?

251
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,500
 Jesus says every evil action comes from an evil thought

252
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,820
 that has taken place in the mind,

253
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,760
 and all of that comes from the heart.

254
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,860
 All of these are evils, and they come from inside,

255
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,820
 and they defile a person.

256
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,000
 Jesus says sinful anger, what leads to malice,

257
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,860
 what leads to murder, comes from within the heart.

258
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,620
 In other words, typically, when I get angry, I get upset,

259
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,260
 I usually don't think, oh man,

260
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,900
 there's something going on inside of me.

261
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,860
 I think this person lied to me.

262
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,780
 This person took credit for something that they didn't do.

263
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,060
 This person cut me off in traffic,

264
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,540
 and they need to learn how to drive.

265
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,660
 I think that the expressions of anger come from the outside,

266
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,860
 and Jesus says, no, no, no, no, no.

267
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,840
 Anger comes from within.

268
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,460
 You may go through life, and it'll trigger it.

269
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,620
 Stress will trigger your anger,

270
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,860
 and all of a sudden, you're just really overwhelmed at work,

271
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,580
 and you explode on your roommate,

272
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,020
 or you lash out at a friend.

273
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,420
 Jesus would say, that's not because of the stress,

274
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,980
 that's because you have something broken

275
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,820
 inside of your heart.

276
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,220
 The root of your anger comes from within.

277
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,900
 If you don't fix that, you cannot fix your anger.

278
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,580
 Jesus' baby brother, James,

279
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,300
 his baby brother was not named Jesus,

280
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,460
 that would be interesting.

281
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,820
 (congregation laughing)

282
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,860
 James, at some point in his life, trusted in Christ.

283
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,700
 We don't have time to go into that,

284
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,400
 but how crazy is that, his little brother?

285
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,820
 And he writes a book called the Book of James.

286
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,100
 In the fourth chapter of that book,

287
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,260
 listen to what he says about what causes conflict,

288
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,580
 causes division, causes fights.

289
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,500
 "What causes fights and quarrels among you?"

290
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,060
 Well, James, let me give you the answer.

291
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,540
 She was mean.

292
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,720
 She was hurtful.

293
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,860
 They didn't respond.

294
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,820
 They didn't invite me to come.

295
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,660
 Nope.

296
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:18,420
 They come from your desires that battle within you.

297
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,820
 You desire, but you do not have, so you kill.

298
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,020
 And James is exaggerating.

299
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,360
 He's saying, you desire, so you don't have, so you kill.

300
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,780
 And all of a sudden, you go, no, no, no, I'm never killed.

301
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,180
 The same expression that leads to killing someone

302
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,580
 is anger, hatred, bitterness.

303
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,140
 And James says, all of that anger,

304
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,180
 it doesn't come from the outside.

305
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,140
 It doesn't come from what was done

306
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,740
 or wasn't done against you.

307
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,980
 It comes from within.

308
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,300
 In Hebrews chapter 12, verse 15, it says this.

309
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,780
 "See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God

310
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,260
 "and that no bitter root grows up

311
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,740
 "and causes trouble and defiles many."

312
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,340
 The Bible says, like, bitterness,

313
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,300
 think about this, it's so brilliant.

314
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,780
 It's like a root that'll come in your life,

315
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,220
 and as it grows, it begins to impact your life.

316
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,100
 Why is that brilliant?

317
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,060
 Because what's a root?

318
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,140
 A root is something that, you know,

319
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,100
 the roots of a plant, the roots of a flower

320
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,300
 are something beneath the surface.

321
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,640
 You can't see 'em, but they're impacting everything

322
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,020
 that you can see on the surface.

323
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,380
 It's what the author of Hebrews says,

324
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,480
 you know, that's like what bitterness is like.

325
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,340
 It's this thing that is beneath the surface,

326
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,220
 and it just gets buried underneath there,

327
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,980
 and somebody called you a name in sixth grade,

328
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,980
 and every time now anybody insults the way

329
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,380
 that you look on the outside,

330
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,620
 so there's a root of bitterness that's growing underneath,

331
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,260
 and you can't see it, but it's buried there,

332
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,500
 and it's affecting everything,

333
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,620
 just like the roots of a flower affect everything

334
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,380
 that you can see above the surface.

335
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,660
 That root of bitterness is gonna affect everything

336
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,260
 above the surface in your life,

337
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,260
 and if you want to deal with anger, or sinful anger,

338
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,860
 it involves dealing with it at a heart level.

339
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,420
 In other words, the temptation will always be,

340
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,580
 or often be, to think that anger is something

341
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,520
 that is caused by other people around us,

342
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,640
 as though like, you know, I'm justified in what I did

343
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,660
 because of, you know, the actions that they took.

344
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,000
 My roommate, all of a sudden, I come home,

345
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 we've been sharing a room for a while,

346
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,040
 I've told him so many times, when you wash the dishes,

347
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,280
 and you get dishes in there,

348
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,160
 make sure that you don't leave it out

349
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,600
 because your little crusty noodles

350
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,440
 end up caking to the outside of the metal,

351
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,000
 and it's disgusting, and how many times,

352
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,240
 what am I, your mom right now?

353
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,800
 And you think that, man, I'm angry because of that.

354
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,960
 Jesus says, no, no, no.

355
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,240
 Anger comes from within,

356
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,320
 as though like this would be you and I's heart,

357
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,440
 and inside of it has a potential,

358
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,160
 and the capacity to carry around anger,

359
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,440
 and then something triggers it,

360
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,720
 where a roommate comes out, and comes all of a sudden,

361
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,800
 and they failed to, you know,

362
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,100
 clean up the dishes that they had,

363
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,000
 or they borrowed your clothes without even asking,

364
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,640
 and all of a sudden, boom, and it pops out,

365
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,680
 and it's not because of something that they did.

366
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,000
 What they did just triggered the anger

367
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,820
 that is already inside of your heart to come out.

368
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,660
 This is the way the Bible talks about it,

369
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,800
 that you'll be going along, and road rage.

370
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,480
 People are driving, and you think it's because,

371
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,600
 look, you're driving, we're going up 75,

372
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,560
 and we're locked gridlock here,

373
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,160
 and everyone, if you could just learn how to drive,

374
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,640
 and you explode, and you think it's because

375
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,400
 people don't know how to drive.

376
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
 You think it's because people,

377
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,520
 if we could all just drive 70 people,

378
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,760
 the problem would go away.

379
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,520
 And James says, no, no, no, no.

380
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,280
 Jesus says, no, the anger, it's already in there.

381
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,800
 Those are just triggers that are bringing it

382
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,040
 out to the surface.

383
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,900
 At work, where you snap, and you respond to a coworker,

384
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,540
 or to your boss, or you lash out with an email,

385
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,480
 because they got credit for something that they didn't do,

386
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,960
 or you lash out because you didn't get credit

387
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,420
 because of something you did do.

388
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,680
 And Jesus says something really profound,

389
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,840
 and really necessary if you and I are gonna experience

390
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,680
 freedom from anger, which is knowing

391
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,220
 anytime that anger pops up, it's a heart issue.

392
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,540
 It's underneath the surface.

393
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,080
 There is a way to address it.

394
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,320
 And if you do not address it,

395
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
 it, like any fire that seeps out,

396
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,300
 will continue to burn and bring destruction

397
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,140
 to everything it touches.

398
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,100
 And let me just say this.

399
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,820
 In the room, all of us have certain levels of anger

400
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,420
 that are buried in our heart.

401
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,580
 And all of us also express that anger in different ways.

402
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,460
 Like, there's really at least two categories

403
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,300
 of people in the room.

404
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,860
 There would be people, when it comes to getting angry,

405
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,420
 they would be what you would call an exploder.

406
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,160
 This is the guy, gets upset, punches a hole in the wall.

407
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,260
 We're very clearly like, yes, he has an anger problem.

408
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,240
 Very easy to see.

409
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,260
 This is the girl who, you know, gets upset,

410
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,400
 just goes on, you know, a rampage online,

411
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,560
 and she is keyboard caring,

412
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,480
 going to everybody's comments,

413
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,080
 being like, I can't believe you.

414
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,720
 It's clear, like, man, she's clearly angry.

415
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,980
 So there's the exploder, and then there are the imploders.

416
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,600
 This is a much more difficult to see perspective on anger,

417
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,160
 or expression of anger.

418
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,120
 This is the person who doesn't explode outwardly.

419
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,180
 They get hurt, and they just shut down.

420
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,880
 They begin, you hurt them in a relationship,

421
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,100
 they totally withdraw.

422
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,700
 This person ends up behaving passively aggressive

423
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,920
 towards you, or, you know, she's like,

424
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,600
 you're friends, or you thought you were friends,

425
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,000
 and you're like, well, why didn't you invite me to the party?

426
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,140
 And she's like, oh, what?

427
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,700
 And she just behaves in a way.

428
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,600
 Or she's passively aggressive, as in passive aggressive,

429
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,060
 meaning on the outside, it's passive.

430
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,140
 But there's clearly anger and hurt that is taking place,

431
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,140
 and just as angry and hurt and seeping with bitterness

432
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,360
 can be that person.

433
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,180
 Often, the imploder, if you are one, you deny your anger.

434
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,300
 And somebody hurts you, and you don't even have time

435
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,740
 to totally process it all in the moment,

436
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,220
 and so they're like, hey, I'm sorry, did that hurt you?

437
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,780
 And you're like, no, no, everything's fine,

438
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,860
 just please leave me alone for the rest of my life.

439
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,860
 That's what you do.

440
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,340
 (congregation laughing)

441
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,820
 But you harbor that anger, and you're gonna carry it around,

442
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,980
 and you may not last out of the person who hurt you,

443
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,780
 but you'll carry it around, and it will come out,

444
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,140
 even on people who have nothing to do with that hurt.

445
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,800
 But the root of all of it is at the heart,

446
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,440
 and there is a way to address it.

447
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,320
 Ultimately, the results of what happens

448
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,040
 from sinful anger are the same every single time.

449
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,540
 Jesus says this in Matthew chapter five, verse 21.

450
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,200
 This is in the Sermon on the Mount.

451
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,960
 Most famous sermon Jesus ever gave, just picture it.

452
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,240
 They call it a mount, Sermon on the Mount,

453
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,080
 because he taught it.

454
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
 In Matthew chapter five, verse one,

455
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,020
 we're told from a mountainside.

456
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,160
 Jesus is sitting there, early in his ministry,

457
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,440
 very first message he ever gives,

458
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,920
 thousands of people gathered around.

459
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,460
 See it.

460
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,460
 This Israeli 33 or 30-year-old rabbi shows up,

461
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,980
 and he begins to teach and blow everybody's category

462
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,500
 in the sermon, and this is one of the things that he says.

463
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,320
 You've heard it said long ago, you shall not murder,

464
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,380
 and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.

465
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,880
 But I tell you, anyone who is angry with a brother

466
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,900
 or a sister or a person will be subject to judgment.

467
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,860
 That word subject to judgment is just out of step

468
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,300
 with God's command, has fallen short of what God commands.

469
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,220
 In other words, Jesus is like,

470
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,780
 you guys put the line at murder.

471
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,300
 As long as you don't murder, no anger problem.

472
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,420
 Jesus says, no, that's not where God puts the line.

473
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,340
 Anyone who holds anger in their heart

474
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,460
 is out of step with God.

475
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,460
 Now, the word anger in this context, or being angry,

476
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,020
 is not the word like you had an angry thought,

477
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,060
 a one-off occasion.

478
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,220
 It's a word to dwell on or focus on that anger,

479
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,040
 continue to replay it, not deal with it.

480
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,940
 In other words, it's not an anger you feel in a moment,

481
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,700
 it's an anger you fuel or you feed over time.

482
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,120
 You keep replaying, you keep replaying,

483
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,500
 and the more you replay it, the more you continue

484
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,000
 to not believe more and more the best about someone

485
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,380
 you believe the worst and worst and worst and worst

486
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,420
 and worst, and Jesus says, when you do that,

487
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,340
 you are just as guilty and just as off

488
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,060
 as the person who murders.

489
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:54,420
 And then he says, verse 23,

490
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,020
 if you are offering a gift at the altar,

491
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,700
 that'd be like if you're going to church,

492
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,420
 and you remember that your brother or sister

493
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,620
 has something against you, I want you to leave your gift

494
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,060
 at the altar, in the front of the altar.

495
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,900
 You go there to church, raising,

496
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,560
 you turn graves into gardens, yes I will,

497
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,660
 and you realize, man, I think that Becky was hurt

498
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,160
 by the tone of that email or my text message

499
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,860
 or what I did.

500
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,180
 He says, in the moment when you realize that,

501
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,860
 I want you to leave your gift at the altar

502
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,500
 and go and be reconciled in that relationship,

503
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,460
 then come back and offer your gift.

504
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,380
 Why would you say that, Jesus?

505
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,900
 Because Jesus knew that the results of sinful anger

506
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,300
 every time are broken relationships.

507
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,940
 Every time sinful anger takes place in the heart,

508
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,820
 every time you allow it and I allow it to exist

509
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,480
 in your hearts, the damage that's gonna take place

510
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,980
 is damage to you and damage to your relationships.

511
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,780
 And I'm not even talking about like, oh, well,

512
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,020
 you know, Becky hurt me in that moment,

513
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,540
 so now I guess Becky and I are just gonna be off.

514
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,940
 You harbor that bitterness and it's gonna show itself

515
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,260
 back up in all kinds, every relationship.

516
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,580
 There are lots more relationships than just that one.

517
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,380
 Because the damage or the results of sinful anger

518
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,180
 in the heart are always broken relationships.

519
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,900
 Jesus says something really profound.

520
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,380
 I think about this.

521
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,020
 I don't know, maybe you're here and a friend invited you

522
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,320
 and you're not even sure where you are in faith.

523
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,840
 What Jesus just said to his audience,

524
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,060
 how category-blowing was this?

525
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,960
 I want you to prioritize over giving any sort of sacrifice,

526
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,060
 overcoming the church and worship,

527
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,240
 I want you to prioritize your horizontal relationships

528
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,980
 with other people above this one.

529
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,340
 Like in other words, hey, we're not gonna be good

530
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,780
 if you continue to live not good with other people.

531
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,860
 You continue to hide behind like, well, you know,

532
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,540
 they hurt me and they need to come apologize to me

533
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,660
 because really, you know, I may have not been the best

534
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,420
 in that moment, but if anybody is at fault, it's them,

535
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,300
 Jesus would say.

536
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,460
 You just recognize that you're off with someone

537
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,460
 and you should go seek that person out.

538
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,860
 Because if you don't, broken relationship

539
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,740
 will take place there, it'll take place in your future,

540
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,240
 and in a way, it disconnects you from right relating to God.

541
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,620
 Some of you were really hurt by your dad,

542
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:20,040
 and I love you, I see you, I love this group,

543
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,200
 I love this generation, I believe in this generation,

544
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,680
 and as a bigger brother in life,

545
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,080
 I'm telling you, you've gotta forgive him.

546
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,560
 Holding onto that is only gonna hurt you,

547
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,480
 and you know what, if I knew your story

548
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,960
 and I knew what happened, I would be angry too.

549
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,080
 You holding onto that, and that anger, it's not going away,

550
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,520
 and it's gonna keep following you.

551
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,520
 So as someone who has no skin in the game

552
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,480
 other than I care about each one of you,

553
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,800
 you have got to deal with that hurt.

554
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,440
 Some of you have a past job,

555
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,380
 and you weren't treated right there.

556
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,700
 And so one day, you just kinda like went MIA,

557
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,720
 and you were like, I'm gonna do ghosting to my work,

558
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,420
 and I'm just saying, I'm done, I'll leave the computer,

559
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,100
 and I'm not coming back anymore,

560
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,500
 'cause I've been updating my LinkedIn profile,

561
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,300
 and I got some leads, and I'm gonna run that direction,

562
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,900
 because you guys don't appreciate me,

563
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,980
 and ain't nobody got time for that,

564
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,880
 and you decided you were gonna let that hurt rule your life.

565
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,460
 And you may need to call up your old boss,

566
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,020
 and say, hey, I didn't act like God would've had me,

567
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,360
 and the way that I responded to how I was feeling,

568
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,360
 or the hurt that I experienced was wrong.

569
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,780
 And you need to forgive and make the decision,

570
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,100
 and I'm gonna talk more in a second

571
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,220
 about what that looks like.

572
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,400
 Some of you are angry, understandably,

573
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,640
 you're just angry at men,

574
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,440
 because you were sexually abused,

575
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,880
 and it wasn't your fault.

576
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,120
 And that type of action angers the heart of God,

577
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,600
 and it was wrong, it wasn't deserved,

578
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,320
 and it wasn't okay.

579
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:13,040
 But you've gotta work through that hurt, and that anger,

580
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,980
 and I hate that you feel that,

581
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,320
 and it's really understandable you feel that.

582
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,200
 But if you keep holding that, it is not going away,

583
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,360
 and God loves you.

584
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,600
 He doesn't want you to go through life

585
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,340
 holding onto that pain and that anger,

586
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,800
 'cause it's not hurting them, it's hurting you,

587
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,380
 and will continue to hurt you.

588
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,440
 I don't know what experience it is,

589
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,440
 maybe it's family, or a sibling, or a past roommate,

590
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,200
 and you're really hurt, understandably really hurt,

591
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,920
 a boyfriend who cheated on you.

592
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,400
 But if you hold onto that bitterness,

593
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,240
 it'll continue to grow, to add more experiences like it,

594
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,960
 and like a fire, will eventually make its way out,

595
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,820
 and hurt any relationship that's in your life.

596
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,500
 When I do counseling with couples,

597
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,420
 when I do marriage counseling,

598
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,700
 or I agree to marry someone,

599
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,100
 I ask the same question, one of the questions I ask,

600
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,080
 I ask it every time.

601
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,460
 And I ask both the groom to be, and the bride to be,

602
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,340
 is there anyone in your life who you've not forgiven?

603
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,760
 Parent, past relations, is there anyone

604
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,020
 that you're harboring, holding to bitterness on?

605
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,180
 And if they say yes, so and so,

606
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,580
 I tell them I won't do the wedding,

607
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,400
 until they've worked through that,

608
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,540
 and it's not because I don't love them,

609
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,500
 it's not because I don't care about them,

610
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,780
 it's because I love them so much,

611
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,140
 I want them to make sure they enter into marriage,

612
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,340
 with the footing that I'm not going through life

613
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,460
 holding onto hurts, and bitterness, and anger, and grudges.

614
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,020
 Because if you hold onto hurts before you get into marriage,

615
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,420
 you're gonna hold onto 'em when you get in there.

616
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,260
 'Cause you're already used to it,

617
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,080
 it's just what I do.

618
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,540
 When somebody really deeply hurts me,

619
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,860
 and almost always the case,

620
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,320
 the answer to that question if someone says yes,

621
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,380
 I haven't forgiven this person,

622
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,220
 you know what it is?

623
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,740
 It's not that, oh, you know what?

624
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,240
 The grocery clerk at Trader Joe's was like,

625
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,700
 oh, you can have one bag, and I was like,

626
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,420
 oh my gosh, and this is the person I'm angry,

627
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,580
 it's never that person.

628
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,700
 It's my dad.

629
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,140
 It's my mom, she walked out.

630
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,320
 It's my sister.

631
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,260
 It's some like intimate relationship.

632
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,940
 And I lovingly look, and I say,

633
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,860
 if you can't work through that, and forgive that person,

634
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,440
 you're not ready to marry him,

635
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,100
 or you're not ready to marry her.

636
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,560
 Because that intimate relationship

637
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,780
 that really hurt you, that's generally how it gets hurt,

638
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,580
 is it's like it's a father figure, it's a mother figure,

639
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,620
 it's a sibling, it's my own blood.

640
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,980
 That's why the pain is so deep.

641
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,460
 You will have the same experience with your husband,

642
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,700
 with your wife.

643
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,020
 Listen to me very closely.

644
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,600
 If you have not forgiven people,

645
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,860
 as lovingly as I can say it,

646
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,000
 you are not ready to get married.

647
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 85% of you, 80% of you, will get married by age 35.

648
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,860
 So, everyone but y'all.

649
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,420
 And, I'm totally kidding.

650
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,000
 That's true.

651
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,860
 Statistically speaking, that's true.

652
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,520
 Statistically speaking, what else is true,

653
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,480
 is 50% of you will get divorced.

654
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,320
 Why?

655
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,400
 Because people go through life,

656
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
 and they hold onto these hurts,

657
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,600
 and they feel justified in these hurts,

658
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,720
 and I can't believe that he did that,

659
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,760
 and no one ever says, you need to deal with that pain,

660
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,680
 you need to deal with that hurt.

661
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,800
 Then they take it into marriage,

662
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,880
 and then the most intimate human relationship

663
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,720
 you're gonna have.

664
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,040
 Anyone know what that is?

665
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,580
 It's not your sister, it's your spouse.

666
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,440
 The person who the most intimate relationship you have,

667
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,120
 and then they hurt you.

668
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,840
 And, just how deeply intimate it is,

669
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,860
 also equates to how deeply painful it will be

670
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,000
 when they hurt you, and they will hurt you.

671
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,880
 Sometimes intentionally, sometimes not intentionally,

672
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,280
 it's just a part of being married

673
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,880
 to another sinful human being.

674
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,920
 So, if you haven't worked through,

675
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,140
 and you're the person who, man, when I get hurt,

676
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,720
 I hold on, I hit the ejection button, I get out,

677
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,480
 you are not ready to get married.

678
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,160
 Because when you move in that direction,

679
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,060
 marriage is one deep hurt after another,

680
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,820
 and having to choose, I'm not holding onto this grudge.

681
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,300
 What I mean, like, imagine with me.

682
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,180
 I saw this illustration, a friend of mine shared it with me,

683
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,120
 and I was just like, man, it's such a great illustration.

684
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,620
 Especially for this group as it relates to marriage.

685
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,700
 And I know a lot of you are like, dude,

686
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,500
 I'm not even dating, and you're angry at me

687
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,380
 because we're talking about marriage.

688
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,220
 I know you're not.

689
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,380
 I'm saying, before you even get there,

690
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,300
 you need to know, if you hold onto that hurt,

691
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,420
 you hold onto that roommate,

692
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,380
 and I can't believe that he did that,

693
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,580
 and I don't talk to him anymore.

694
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,860
 You're the type of person that is gonna hold onto hurt

695
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,380
 against your spouse.

696
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,220
 'Cause you're gonna get in there,

697
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,960
 and you're gonna realize, it's great,

698
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,360
 if you're dating and you're like,

699
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,240
 not us, baby, we're together forever, it's amazing.

700
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,320
 You're gonna realize,

701
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,640
 there are gonna be times where they deeply hurt you.

702
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,320
 And you're gonna find yourself going, I cannot believe that.

703
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,680
 And all of a sudden, if you make,

704
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,920
 you're already making the practice that,

705
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,660
 hey, I got hurt, I hold onto it.

706
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,440
 You're gonna hold onto it, and the more that you do,

707
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,760
 it's gonna wall off and separate you from that other person.

708
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,600
 What do I mean?

709
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,560
 You're gonna get in a marriage,

710
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,040
 and all of a sudden, you're gonna be around

711
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,960
 that special someone girl, and you guys got married.

712
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
 Like, go there with me in your head.

713
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,480
 You guys got married, it's beautiful.

714
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,040
 You're probably not even dating, but just mentally,

715
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,400
 put a faceless person next to you,

716
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,460
 and you're like, they look like everything

717
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,200
 I ever wanted in them, and this is so great,

718
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,480
 and they have the job that we want,

719
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,400
 and we're married together.

720
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,360
 Go there with me for a, it just happened.

721
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,720
 You get married, things are going great,

722
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,480
 honeymoon, everything's awesome.

723
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,580
 Eventually, you're like, oh man,

724
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,980
 you brought in this relationship debt.

725
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,280
 We gotta get rid of your debt,

726
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,260
 or we gotta get rid of my debt.

727
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,360
 So we're getting on a budget, honey.

728
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,520
 And then she's gonna show up, and she's gonna say,

729
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,480
 hey, great news, I know you're gonna be pumped for me.

730
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,120
 There was a sale at Nordstrom's.

731
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,960
 And so they had these shoes, and I was like,

732
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,640
 oh my gosh, I can't believe that.

733
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,420
 It would be like wrong to not buy these shoes,

734
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,440
 because I'm gonna need shoes eventually,

735
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,240
 and this is the most affordable I've ever seen them before,

736
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,340
 and you're gonna be like, we're on a budget, babe.

737
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,780
 Why did you not follow the budget we agreed to

738
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,620
 that we set out on?

739
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,960
 You will like continue to do this.

740
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,360
 And I'll tell you why, it's 'cause you're selfish.

741
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,120
 You don't care about it, and you'll lash out,

742
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,480
 and you'll hold onto that grudge,

743
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,000
 and all of a sudden, that offense gets buried

744
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,040
 inside of your heart.

745
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,880
 And you're gonna go, this is just who she is.

746
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,240
 She doesn't care.

747
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,560
 Same thing's gonna happen to girls.

748
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,920
 You're gonna find yourself, your husband,

749
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,360
 all of a sudden, you had weekend plans.

750
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,960
 And when you were dating, one of the things

751
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,080
 you loved about him was he was flexible,

752
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,920
 he was just go lucky, he doesn't keep a calendar,

753
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,600
 like he's not rigid, and I'm a little type A,

754
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,160
 and so it really balances us out,

755
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,320
 and I just love that about him.

756
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,640
 And then you get married, and you know what?

757
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,460
 You had a shower planned, a good friend of yours,

758
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,000
 maybe your bridesmaid, and you're wedding,

759
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,360
 she's got a wedding shower coming up,

760
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,960
 and you were supposed to go as a couple shower,

761
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,880
 you're gonna go together, and he double booked.

762
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,880
 'Cause remember, you married a guy who's not rigid,

763
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,080
 doesn't keep a calendar, so he's a little flexible,

764
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,120
 and you're like, you don't even care about me.

765
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,680
 You knew how important this was to me,

766
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,840
 and the thing that you were so like,

767
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,400
 oh, I just love that about him, all of a sudden,

768
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,800
 you're like, you don't care.

769
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,200
 Then, one night, you come home,

770
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,420
 and one of you decides you're gonna initiate sex.

771
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,960
 And the other person finds himself going,

772
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,160
 oh man, it's just been like a really stressful time,

773
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,040
 or I'm just really tired right now,

774
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,640
 and I'm just kinda not in the mood.

775
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
 I know what you're thinking, you're like,

776
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,480
 (laughs)

777
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,680
 no, we won't, I will always be in the mood.

778
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,720
 I'm gonna marry someone with the same sex drive that I have,

779
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,880
 we'll always be in the mood.

780
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,720
 No, you won't.

781
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,280
 And you're thinking right now, no, he's wrong,

782
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,100
 we totally won't.

783
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,280
 Nope, you're still wrong.

784
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
 Not gonna happen.

785
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,000
 And you are gonna initiate sex,

786
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,040
 and they are gonna say no.

787
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,320
 And you are gonna feel offended,

788
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,960
 and you're gonna go, what, oh,

789
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,000
 what, you just think I'm fat now?

790
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,920
 Is that what this is about?

791
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,800
 And you're gonna run there, and think,

792
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,600
 he doesn't care about me.

793
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,240
 And all of a sudden, that offense continues to build,

794
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,000
 and to build, and to build.

795
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And then, we didn't even introduce the in-laws.

796
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,120
 Okay?

797
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,480
 (audience laughs)

798
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,400
 And she's got a really close relationship with her mom,

799
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,840
 so she calls her mom all the time.

800
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
 And when you were dating, you didn't even realize it,

801
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,400
 'cause you didn't see her on the phone all the time,

802
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,360
 'cause you didn't live together.

803
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,680
 And she would just call her mom every night

804
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,620
 after she got done with the date,

805
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,960
 she's driving home, she's calling her mom,

806
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,280
 you don't even know it, they're really close,

807
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,200
 talks all the time.

808
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,660
 Then you get married, you live together.

809
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,780
 You see it all the time.

810
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,760
 Sitting on the couch, you're like,

811
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,820
 I thought we were gonna watch the show,

812
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,080
 and she's talking to her mom, giving the update.

813
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,480
 And when she has trouble, she needs advice.

814
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,320
 Who does she call?

815
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,520
 She calls her mom.

816
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,360
 You had no idea.

817
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,680
 And all of a sudden, you begin to think,

818
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,820
 this woman doesn't even respect me.

819
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,960
 She doesn't care about my opinion.

820
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,280
 She just cares about her mom.

821
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,160
 She cares about what she thinks way more

822
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,960
 than she does what I think.

823
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,080
 And all of a sudden, bitterness after bitterness,

824
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,520
 then you got holidays, and you were like,

825
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,680
 man, holidays are gonna be great, I can't wait.

826
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,580
 Once you get to the fact that, hey,

827
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,580
 you now divide the carries on the holidays.

828
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,640
 So you're like, oh, we're going to Christmas at your mom's

829
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,920
 or Christmas at my mom's?

830
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,680
 And she's like, well, I think we both know

831
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,800
 that your family's a little awkward,

832
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,720
 and mine gives the best gifts,

833
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,440
 and so this feels like really easy.

834
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,520
 Let's do Thanksgiving with yours.

835
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,840
 And you're like, Thanksgiving?

836
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,880
 That's like the B-team version of holiday.

837
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,780
 You don't care, you know my mom gave birth to me, right?

838
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:03,080
 And all of a sudden, what gets buried is anger,

839
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,760
 bitterness, and hurt.

840
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,300
 And then, he ends up working late,

841
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,220
 and you had plans that night, and you're like,

842
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,640
 I told you we had dinner with the Smiths.

843
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,320
 Do you not care about our family?

844
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,600
 And he's like, yes, what do you think I do at work all day?

845
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,820
 Just get a massage?

846
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,700
 I care about our family, I work really hard.

847
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,920
 And both of you go, you don't care.

848
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,200
 You don't care about our family, you don't care that I work.

849
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,500
 And all of a sudden, step after step,

850
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,560
 it just begins to grow.

851
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,180
 And then, you introduce little ones.

852
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,260
 Those are gonna be fun.

853
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,700
 They got these little kids, they look like you.

854
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,040
 It's little mini me, little girl,

855
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,600
 princess dresses all the time, super fun.

856
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,860
 They also don't sleep that great.

857
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,160
 So one of you is gonna be what we call a light sleeper.

858
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,460
 And what's gonna happen is they're gonna be the one

859
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,780
 who hears the children at night.

860
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,940
 Typically, this is always the mom.

861
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,140
 They've got some weird spidey sense.

862
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,020
 But they end up waking up in the middle of the night,

863
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,440
 they hear the kids crying out there, like,

864
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,300
 and they wonder, why don't you care about our kids?

865
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,800
 I'm always the one getting up in kids,

866
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,040
 and I'd like a little help from time to time,

867
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,840
 because I'm up all hours of the night,

868
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
 and you don't even care.

869
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,760
 And I kicked you six times last night,

870
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,640
 and you don't care about your children.

871
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
 And it continues to grow and grow.

872
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,600
 And you know what's weird?

873
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,700
 Like, you get better over time as you do these things,

874
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,880
 and you begin to hold on.

875
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,480
 And little things, that you're like,

876
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,520
 how did that even become a thing?

877
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,100
 Becomes a thing.

878
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,240
 What do I mean?

879
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,680
 Eventually, after those little kids come,

880
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,400
 you're gonna be, sometimes,

881
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,880
 things happen with the body and hormones,

882
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,560
 and there I go.

883
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,840
 And the wife will feel like,

884
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,800
 man, I just don't feel as pretty as I used to feel,

885
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,920
 and I can't work out nearly as much,

886
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,520
 'cause I have these babies all around me all the time

887
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,880
 that are just little milk monsters,

888
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,560
 and I feel like I'm just kinda gross.

889
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,440
 And then you get this sale, and you get that dress,

890
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,040
 and he was like, get that dress, and you get that dress,

891
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
 and you get home, you go into a banquet for his work,

892
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,600
 and you put it on, and you're like, oh man,

893
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,240
 I just need some affirmation right now.

894
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,640
 I just feel like, it's been kinda gross for a while,

895
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,400
 and I just wanna look pretty and just be affirmed.

896
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,000
 And you ask your husband, how do I look?

897
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 And he says, great.

898
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,880
 Men.

899
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,240
 (audience laughing)

900
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,360
 She doesn't want you to say great.

901
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,040
 She wants you to say, oh, wow!

902
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,640
 We are getting a babysitter, we are canceling the banquet,

903
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,680
 we're getting a hotel is what we're getting.

904
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,200
 That's what she wants you to say.

905
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,480
 But she doesn't hear that.

906
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,880
 So all of a sudden, she runs to, great?

907
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,120
 I look great?

908
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,520
 He doesn't even love me.

909
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,960
 And one by one by one,

910
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,120
 your relationship begins to get walled off.

911
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,600
 And that offense after offense

912
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,120
 builds a fence between the two of you.

913
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,720
 It happens, it's happening,

914
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,920
 it's why the divorce rate is what it is.

915
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,660
 And if you can't learn to be the type of person

916
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,360
 that doesn't hold on and say, I'm keeping this,

917
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,740
 you're not ready for marriage.

918
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,600
 If you're in a place where you're seriously dating

919
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,440
 and moving in that direction

920
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,360
 and you haven't forgiven people in your life,

921
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,320
 we'll talk about that in just a second,

922
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,780
 you are not ready to move in that direction.

923
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,560
 And now is the time,

924
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,600
 whether you're single, dating, whatever you're at,

925
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,500
 to begin to form the habit.

926
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,700
 I don't hold onto these.

927
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,960
 'Cause anytime I do, it's gonna keep showing up

928
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,600
 and keep breaking down relationships.

929
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,880
 Jesus says it happens every time, but there is a solution.

930
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,000
 Ephesians chapter four, verse 26 and 27 says this.

931
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,300
 In your anger, do not sin.

932
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,800
 Do not let the sun go down while you're angry.

933
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,000
 Do not give the devil a foothold.

934
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,240
 Get rid, I want you to listen to this next verse.

935
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,140
 The apostle Paul wrote this next verse

936
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,240
 from a Roman jail cell

937
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,640
 where law enforcement had wrongly arrested

938
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,180
 him for a crime he did not commit.

939
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,720
 He was waiting to be killed

940
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,600
 for the crime of being a Christian.

941
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,100
 He went sitting, drinking a latte

942
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,360
 at some all-inclusive resort

943
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,520
 when he wrote what he was about to write.

944
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,460
 It's pretty crazy.

945
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,880
 And as he leaned back with scars on his back

946
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,400
 from being whipped against the jail cell,

947
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,360
 he penned down the following words in 60 AD.

948
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,800
 "Get rid of all bitterness, rage, and anger."

949
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,720
 All bitterness, Paul?

950
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,560
 All of it.

951
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,680
 "Brawling and slander, and every form of malice,"

952
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,320
 which is just ill will towards people.

953
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,480
 How do I do that, Paul?

954
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,560
 "Be kind and compassionate to one another,

955
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:51,800
 "forgiving each other just as Christ, just as in Christ.

956
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,680
 "God forgave you."

957
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,000
 The remedy for sinful anger is forgiveness.

958
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,600
 And I'm making the decision to forgive.

959
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,440
 Now, what does forgiveness mean?

960
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,720
 'Cause this is a word that's really churchy

961
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,120
 that most people are like, "Oh, yeah, I know what it means."

962
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,960
 And they don't.

963
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,920
 Like, forgive and forget, that's right.

964
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,480
 No, that's not right.

965
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,520
 What does forgiveness mean, biblically?

966
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,280
 Everyone following me?

967
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,800
 It means I'm releasing in the face of hurt,

968
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,000
 in the face of harm taking place against me,

969
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,160
 in the face of whatever has made me anger, angry, and bitter.

970
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,000
 I'm choosing to release my demand for justice

971
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,840
 or for payback to God.

972
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,560
 I'm choosing, "Hey, you cheated on me,

973
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,400
 "and I'm really angry,

974
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,220
 "and I want you to suffer because of that."

975
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,160
 I'm choosing to forgive you by releasing

976
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,760
 the demand that's in my heart for justice to God.

977
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,120
 Forgiveness is not excusing sin.

978
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,480
 It's not saying, "Oh, it's not that big of a deal."

979
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,620
 No, sin is a huge deal.

980
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,680
 It's such a big deal, Jesus had to die for it.

981
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,760
 Forgiveness does not require forgetting.

982
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,700
 In fact, I don't even know that you can fully forgive

983
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,800
 someone if you just forget.

984
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,600
 That'd be awesome if men in black could just show up

985
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,920
 and be like, "Hey, you never remember this again."

986
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,120
 No, real forgiveness shows itself in that you did that,

987
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,020
 and I forgive you.

988
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,920
 I'm not holding you accountable for paying back

989
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,400
 for what you owe me, for what you took,

990
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,240
 for how you hurt me.

991
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,360
 It's releasing that to God.

992
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,080
 I'm trusting God with justice.

993
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:31,200
 Forgiveness is not denying your hurt or your anger,

994
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,240
 and forgiveness is not conditional.

995
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,180
 It does not require the person to ask for forgiveness

996
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,400
 or to own their part or even be present.

997
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,200
 It's releasing the demand for justice to God.

998
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,120
 The Bible just said, "How do we forgive?"

999
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,080
 And Paul said, "You forgive like God forgave you

1000
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,840
 "when you didn't deserve it, still don't deserve it,

1001
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,840
 "haven't earned it, but in Christ, he forgave you.

1002
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,900
 "He paid for all of that debt, for every hurt,

1003
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,620
 "for every wrong, for every justice that will

1004
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,060
 "and must take place, and we forgive just like God forgave."

1005
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,040
 In Matthew chapter 18, let me tell a really quick story.

1006
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,840
 We're not far from landing the plane.

1007
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,480
 Matthew chapter 18, the disciples come up to Jesus,

1008
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,120
 and this was all throughout Jesus' teachings.

1009
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,160
 I mean, it's pretty crazy.

1010
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
 You read over and over, like he was really passionate

1011
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,440
 about, "I love relationships, and if you hold onto anger,

1012
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,700
 "you're not gonna have good relationships.

1013
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,600
 "You've gotta forgive."

1014
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,320
 And so Jesus had these guys, the disciples,

1015
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,520
 that heard him talk about this a lot,

1016
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,260
 and they come up to him, and Peter is like,

1017
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,520
 "Hey, guys, I got a question for Jesus.

1018
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,360
 "I got an answer.

1019
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,760
 "I'm really proud of my answer.

1020
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,840
 "Can't wait to see what happens."

1021
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,840
 Goes up to Jesus, "Jesus, how many times

1022
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,940
 "do I forgive my brother?"

1023
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,200
 Now, in Jesus' time, there were a few schools of thought,

1024
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,260
 or there were these philosophy rabbis, basically,

1025
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,180
 that had these camps of like,

1026
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,700
 "Hey, this is the number you forgive.

1027
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,460
 "Up to three times, if they do that action,

1028
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,300
 "you forgive them."

1029
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,620
 Other people would be like, "No, you forgive them once.

1030
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,800
 "If they do it again, they do it once,

1031
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
 "shame on me if they do it."

1032
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,400
 No, however that expression goes,

1033
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,040
 if they do it twice, shame on me.

1034
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,400
 Once, shame on them, whatever that is.

1035
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,760
 There were these different schools of thought.

1036
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,320
 Peter comes up, he says, "How many times should I forgive?"

1037
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,960
 And then he throws out what he was like a zinger.

1038
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,300
 "Up to seven times?"

1039
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,060
 And the reason I say he would have been proud of it

1040
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,140
 is because there's no rabbis that were teaching that.

1041
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,760
 So he's going, "Hey, look how generous I am.

1042
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,740
 "Up to seven, huh?

1043
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,580
 "How about that?

1044
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,860
 "Look how great I am."

1045
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,600
 And Jesus says, "Not seven times, Peter.

1046
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,020
 "70 times seven."

1047
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,780
 In other words, you never stop forgiving.

1048
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,780
 And jaw drops happen all around Jesus.

1049
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,900
 We go, "What?

1050
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,260
 "Over and over and over?"

1051
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,840
 Over and over and over.

1052
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,460
 Is that how God has forgiven you?

1053
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,300
 And then he tells this parable,

1054
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,260
 and it's a beautiful parable,

1055
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,180
 and we don't have time to read it right now,

1056
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,140
 but here's the summary of the parable.

1057
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,460
 Jesus says, "The kingdom of heaven is like this.

1058
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,900
 "There was a guy who had a $6 billion debt."

1059
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,740
 Literally, if you take the number

1060
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,820
 that Jesus equated, $6 billion.

1061
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,860
 This dude had hit Vegas way too many times.

1062
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,860
 Something had happened, he got in debt to another guy,

1063
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,280
 $6 billion, and the guy says,

1064
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,600
 "Hey, you're way overdue on your debt,

1065
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,440
 "and you gotta pay your debt."

1066
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,220
 And the guy says, "I can't pay it, $6 billion."

1067
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,800
 He says, "All right, take him, take everything he owns,

1068
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,260
 "take his family, and sell 'em,

1069
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,920
 "and we'll take the products that are over there,

1070
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,780
 "or we'll take whatever we make off of that person."

1071
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,620
 And the servant, we're told, was in debt.

1072
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,860
 He throws himself to his knees.

1073
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,940
 He begins to say, "Jesus, Jesus."

1074
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,260
 He begins to say to the person in the story,

1075
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,260
 "I'll pay it back.

1076
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,280
 "Please, give me enough time.

1077
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,820
 "Please, show me mercy."

1078
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,420
 And those listening would have known,

1079
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,960
 you can't pay $6 billion back.

1080
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,140
 This was a debt way too great.

1081
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,300
 But the servant's begging, "Please, give me mercy.

1082
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,180
 "Please, I'll pay it back."

1083
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,100
 And we're told, the person he was in debt to

1084
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,180
 showed him mercy and said, "I will forgive the debt."

1085
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,980
 The guy gets up, he goes home, he's really excited.

1086
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,740
 He's gonna go tell his wife, "We were in six,

1087
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,580
 "that's a good day.

1088
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,560
 "You get $6 billion out of debt?

1089
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,460
 "That's an exciting day.

1090
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,780
 "We're going out for champagne or sparkling grape juice

1091
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,020
 "or whatever you feel okay about."

1092
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,000
 And he goes, and on the way home,

1093
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,440
 he bumps into a guy who owes him 1,000 bucks.

1094
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,980
 And he grabs the guy and he says, "Where's my 1,000 bucks?"

1095
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,820
 Jesus is telling the story, so brilliant.

1096
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,820
 He's a great storyteller.

1097
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,100
 He's telling his audience.

1098
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,220
 On his way home, he bumps into the guy

1099
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,140
 that owed him 1,000 bucks.

1100
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,140
 He begins to shake him and say, "Give me my $1,000."

1101
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,980
 And that guy says, "Please, give me time.

1102
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,140
 "I'll pay it back, I'll pay it back, I'll pay it back."

1103
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,980
 And he says, "No."

1104
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,620
 And he throws and sells his family

1105
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,700
 and does what was supposed to happen to him.

1106
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,260
 And we're told that the original guy,

1107
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,780
 the $6 billion guy who forgave the loan,

1108
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,600
 finds out about it.

1109
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,720
 And he comes and he says, "You wicked servant.

1110
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,940
 "I forgave you a million times more of what you owed,

1111
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,240
 "what you can never pay back.

1112
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,860
 "And this guy actually could pay back what you owed him.

1113
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,500
 "And yet you didn't show mercy to him.

1114
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
 "You think I'm gonna show mercy to you?"

1115
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,120
 And then Jesus says this line.

1116
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,100
 "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you.

1117
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,400
 "Unless you forgive your brother or sister from the heart."

1118
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,940
 Wait a second, are you saying that,

1119
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,640
 like if I'm a Christian, but I don't forgive somebody,

1120
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,860
 that you're gonna throw me in some jail?

1121
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,620
 And Jesus is saying, "If you're a Christian,

1122
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,820
 "you forgive people.

1123
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,620
 "Because you've been forgiven of a debt

1124
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,400
 "way bigger than whatever they did to you."

1125
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,960
 And I know that's crazy, because the pain in this room,

1126
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,380
 I've been doing this 13 years.

1127
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,280
 The stories that I've heard of horrific things

1128
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,260
 that have happened are that, they're horrific.

1129
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,220
 And Jesus would say, "No matter what the pain was,

1130
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,660
 "and it wasn't right, and it wasn't deserved,

1131
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,660
 "and it wasn't fair, and it wasn't okay,

1132
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:58,000
 "but it pales in comparison to what you and I have done

1133
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,040
 "in sinning against God, and you must forgive

1134
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,480
 "and choose to forgive."

1135
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,220
 What does it look like to forgive?

1136
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,420
 It looks like canceling the debt,

1137
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,140
 and let me be really clear, I'm gonna move quick,

1138
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,580
 and I wanna, best I can, help practically walk through

1139
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,820
 what that looks like, I think, in your life.

1140
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,940
 Inside of the parable, Jesus says forgiveness

1141
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,540
 is canceling a debt that's owed.

1142
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,140
 It's like, "Hey, you don't owe me anymore,

1143
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,000
 "and I wanna encourage you to do something

1144
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,660
 "that was really helpful for me."

1145
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,620
 There was a moment I sat down in my life

1146
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,060
 where I realized I was carrying a lot of hurt

1147
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,620
 from my father, who was absent.

1148
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,500
 Wasn't present, and I began to process through that pain

1149
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,380
 and through just the counsel of scriptures like these

1150
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,220
 and other believers in my life, going,

1151
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,600
 "In order to cancel a debt, it's really hard

1152
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,980
 "to cancel a debt if you don't know how much the debt is,

1153
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,380
 "if you don't know what the debt is."

1154
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,820
 And I began to go like, "Man, identifying,

1155
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,640
 "what did he take from you, what was taken from you?"

1156
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,100
 'Cause if I'm gonna cancel that,

1157
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,580
 this blanket statement ends up happening

1158
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,500
 for a lot of Christians, they're like,

1159
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,580
 "Yes, I forgive, I feel good today, and I forgive,"

1160
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,820
 and then it pops back up.

1161
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,100
 In order to really forgive, you gotta decide,

1162
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,840
 "Hey, I'm not holding this against you anymore.

1163
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,500
 "I'm canceling what I feel like you owe me

1164
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,500
 "because God has already canceled all that I owe him,

1165
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,420
 "every way that I've sinned against him."

1166
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,620
 And I sat down, and you know what I began to do,

1167
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,180
 I began to write out very specifically,

1168
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,620
 maybe this will be helpful to you,

1169
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,620
 you took from me having a father around.

1170
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:32,780
 You took from me a dad who came to my sport games

1171
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,820
 in college, in high school.

1172
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,180
 You took from me, Monday nights,

1173
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,620
 I had to drive across town to that terrible apartment.

1174
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,620
 And I didn't want to, and I didn't have a choice,

1175
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,020
 'cause custody do orders.

1176
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,460
 You took from me having an example in my life

1177
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,740
 of what it looks like to love a wife.

1178
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:02,880
 And I'm deciding, you don't owe me anymore.

1179
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,600
 (sighing)

1180
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,880
 You never owe me.

1181
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,560
 Every sin that we commit is ultimately a sin against God,

1182
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,480
 and I'm not holding onto that anymore.

1183
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,240
 And that's between you and God.

1184
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,880
 Every sin that you've done will be paid for on the cross,

1185
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,400
 just like every sin I've done was paid for on the cross.

1186
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,020
 I'm not carrying that anymore.

1187
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,440
 Some of you, you've got to do this.

1188
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,440
 And my heart breaks because I know

1189
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,280
 he took from you your virginity.

1190
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,300
 He took from you.

1191
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:49,400
 Having a mother around her, she took from you.

1192
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,560
 He took from you the shame that you carry every day

1193
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,920
 from abortion that you didn't want to get,

1194
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,620
 and he told you you needed to get.

1195
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,000
 You've got to let it go.

1196
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,500
 Holding onto it will only hurt you.

1197
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,360
 And one of the most healthy things you can do

1198
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,620
 is to sit down and write out,

1199
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,380
 this is what was taken from me.

1200
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:20,160
 This is what I experienced, and it wasn't right.

1201
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,600
 And I'm not saying it was right by forgiving it,

1202
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,660
 but I'm not gonna live my life allowing my past experiences

1203
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,520
 and past hurts and people that hurt me so deeply

1204
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,160
 to rule my life, to rule my future marriage,

1205
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,160
 to determine the type of person I'm gonna be.

1206
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,460
 I'm not doing that anymore.

1207
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,680
 I'm not putting whether or not I'm gonna have

1208
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,960
 a healthy relationship with my future husband

1209
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,960
 in the hands of somebody who did horrific things against me.

1210
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,880
 I'm not giving you that power, and it won't be easy,

1211
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,080
 and it's really hard.

1212
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,060
 But God promises when we do,

1213
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,880
 not only do we look more like Jesus,

1214
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,880
 we experience freedom because holding onto that bitterness,

1215
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,160
 it's only gonna hurt you.

1216
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,720
 And as you head into life, all of us have sinned

1217
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,160
 against a perfect God.

1218
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,880
 And what we do as Christians, and this is why I say

1219
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,340
 there is no remedy that I know of

1220
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,640
 outside of what Jesus did on the cross.

1221
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,560
 Where the way that we deal with sin

1222
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,800
 that happened against us and terrible, painful things

1223
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,840
 that happened against you is not by pretending they didn't.

1224
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,320
 It doesn't work.

1225
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,280
 It never will work.

1226
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,560
 It's by making the decision.

1227
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:43,280
 What you did was terrible.

1228
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,620
 It hurt me, it deeply.

1229
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,720
 I've carried that pain for years,

1230
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,960
 and it's making the decision.

1231
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,320
 I'm not gonna carry it anymore

1232
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,600
 because I'm bringing like every hurt

1233
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,360
 I've ever had in life

1234
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:06,640
 into the God who was unjustly,

1235
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:12,320
 unfairly killed, crucified,

1236
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,240
 and had his life taken

1237
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,240
 for every father in this room who failed their kids,

1238
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,860
 for every sexual abuser, every racist police officer,

1239
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:34,520
 every atrocious act, all of them were paid for.

1240
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,480
 And this is the only way to experience freedom,

1241
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,840
 is to accept, God, I'm a way bigger sinner.

1242
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,880
 I've done way worse things than what I am asking

1243
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,520
 or what I'm holding other people,

1244
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:54,120
 or I've done equally as terrible things.

1245
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,400
 The forgiveness that you have extended me

1246
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,600
 is far greater than any forgiveness

1247
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,840
 I'll ever be able to give them, and I am accepting.

1248
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,920
 You paid for it on the cross.

1249
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,080
 Every horrific action will be paid for

1250
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,120
 and was paid for on the cross,

1251
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,320
 will be paid for by that person for all of eternity.

1252
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,640
 Every injustice will be made right,

1253
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,640
 even the ones not caught on camera.

1254
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,280
 And I'm not gonna hold onto that bitterness anymore.

1255
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,440
 I'm not carrying that for the rest of my life.

1256
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,400
 And I love you guys.

1257
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,240
 I love you.

1258
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,080
 I love you.

1259
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:22,020
 And I don't want that for you.

1260
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,560
 But I don't have a decision

1261
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,800
 over whether you're gonna release that,

1262
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,640
 whether you're gonna decide,

1263
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,200
 I'm not carrying this any longer.

1264
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,120
 I'm not gonna define my future,

1265
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,360
 but what happened in the past,

1266
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,200
 what happened against me in the past,

1267
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,400
 it's not a decision I get to make, that's one you have to.

1268
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,880
 As you walk through that, if we can serve and care for

1269
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,560
 and come alongside, we'd love to.

1270
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,200
 God has extended to all people.

1271
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,220
 You bring those and you drop them.

1272
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,300
 They have been paid for.

1273
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,760
 You don't have to hold those.

1274
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,800
 You release them to me.

1275
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,760
 You release them to me.

1276
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,240
 Let me pray.

1277
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:07,120
 Father, thank you for the fact that

1278
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,640
 when we didn't deserve it, we don't deserve it,

1279
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,880
 you extended a forgiveness

1280
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,480
 to a debt we could never repay.

1281
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,440
 Candidly, in life, it feels

1282
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,620
 like what you ask us to do sometimes is not possible.

1283
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,560
 And so I pray that you would help

1284
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,840
 hundreds of us in the room

1285
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,400
 who've experienced hurt at levels

1286
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,120
 we can't even really put into words.

1287
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,120
 I pray for the hundreds in here

1288
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,960
 who've been sexually abused or raped.

1289
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,700
 I pray for those who were molested by a family member,

1290
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,660
 their parents divorced, their parents was alcoholic,

1291
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:53,200
 they abused them, they were robbed,

1292
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,260
 they were unjustly treated by coworkers.

1293
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:01,780
 You would help us, God,

1294
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:05,500
 to have the strength to do what feels impossible,

1295
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,020
 but you went well beyond

1296
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,900
 in the lengths you went to forgive us.

1297
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,300
 And you gave us your spirit.

1298
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,660
 And so would you by your spirit help us,

1299
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,540
 strengthen us, and move us,

1300
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,820
 will we be free, forgiven?

1301
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:25,860
 Worship you in song, amen.

1302
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:35,860
