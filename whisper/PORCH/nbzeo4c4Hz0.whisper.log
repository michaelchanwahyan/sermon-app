[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:27.920]   - Love it.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.760]   Hello, friends in the room.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.680]   Hello, friends in Fort Worth
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.600]   and friends in Houston.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.440]   I'm gonna start by reading the passage
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.080]   that we're gonna look at in Romans 8 tonight.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.720]   I'm gonna start in reading a little bit
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.740]   before it in Romans 7 and then dive in
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.560]   and then I'm gonna pray and we will jump into tonight.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.040]   So this comes from Romans chapter seven,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.300]   verses 15 through 19, 24 and 25,
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.080]   and then one through four in chapter eight.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.060]   We'll hang out tonight.
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.760]   Paul writing to the church in Rome says this,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.280]   "I do not understand what I do,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.180]   "for what I want to do, I do not do.
[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.720]   "But what I hate, I do.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.180]   "And if I do what I do not want to do,
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.380]   "I agree that the law is good.
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.580]   "As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it,
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.120]   "but it is sin living in me.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.260]   "For I know that good itself does not dwell in me,
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.400]   "that is, in my sinful nature.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.560]   "For I have the desire to do what is good,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.160]   "but I cannot carry it out.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.320]   "For I do not do the good I want to,
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.060]   "but the evil that I do not want to do,
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.560]   "this I keep on doing.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.980]   "What a wretched man I am.
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.820]   "Who will rescue me from this body
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.120]   "that is subject to death?
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.080]   "But thanks be to God who delivers me
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.520]   "through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940]   "Therefore, there is now no condemnation
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.120]   "for those who are in Christ Jesus,
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.720]   "because through Christ Jesus,
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.280]   "the law of the spirit of life has set you free
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.860]   "from the law of sin and death.
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.560]   "For the law was powerless to do
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.400]   "because it was weakened by the flesh, God did,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.360]   "by sending his own son in likeness of sinful flesh
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.420]   "to be a sin offering.
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.060]   "And so he condemned sin in the flesh
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.060]   "in order that the righteous requirement of the law
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.120]   "might be fully met in us,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.580]   "who do not live according to the flesh,
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.100]   "but according to the spirit."
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.060]   Will you guys pray with me?
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.000]   Father, we thank you for Romans chapter eight.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.060]   Thank you for the weeks ahead.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.880]   And just the chance that Lord,
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.760]   hopefully, if it be your will,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.980]   we will get to share together
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.280]   as we open and study this incredible chapter.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.300]   Father, I pray for tonight,
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.120]   for the message that we're about to walk through,
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.520]   that anything that I say would be consistent with your word
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.000]   and your will.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.800]   And if it's not, that it would be forgotten
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   as soon as it is said from my mouth.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.020]   I pray for friends in the room who know you,
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.080]   would they be encouraged and equipped
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.360]   and deepen in their relationship with you,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.360]   not because of a message, but because of you.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.320]   Pray for those who don't,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.960]   would they encounter the living God tonight
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.200]   and the Savior who died for them on a cross.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.660]   Will we pray for Brussels?
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.240]   And for all those who are hurting.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.780]   And Lord, in the face of terror,
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.080]   we ask that you would strengthen your church
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   in Belgium and in Brussels,
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.480]   and that where darkness is, light would invade
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.820]   and it would stomp out the darkness
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.080]   as light always does.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.760]   As we wait for your kingdom to fully unravel,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   would we be ambassadors of hope,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.100]   of life, of kindness in the face of evil.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.040]   Thank you for Jesus, the King of all Kings,
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.840]   the Lord of all Lords.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.140]   We love you, amen.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.720]   Is anyone filled out,
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.320]   or did anyone fill out a March Madness bracket
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.080]   just by a show of hands in this room?
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   Yeah?
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.020]   Not as many as I would have thought.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.760]   Is anyone still have their bracket alive right now?
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.060]   It's still in perfect condition.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.520]   No, no, I didn't think so.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.560]   I filled one out.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.720]   I filled it out every single year.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.560]   In fact, it's actually a requirement
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.100]   or part of being on staff at Watermark.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.340]   There's a little family thing
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.800]   where you have to fill out a bracket
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.300]   and it's a competition with consequences involved.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.300]   But on staff, you'll fill this out.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.640]   I filled it out every single year.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.940]   And here's what happens with my bracket.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.280]   Every single year, I fill it out.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.320]   I'll choose differently depending on the year.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   And every year, I'm like,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.380]   this year is going to be the year.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.280]   I'm gonna go all the way.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.120]   It's gonna be awesome.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.960]   We're gonna get there.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.920]   And every year, within like one round,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.620]   some random school from generic Midwestern USA conference
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.660]   ends up beating a top school
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.600]   and the total bracket or my entire bracket is blown.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.840]   Year after year, no matter how hard that I try.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.100]   What was that?
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.940]   - SFA.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.540]   - SFA, all right.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.580]   Oh man, yeah, the SFA.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.120]   SFA did it on Friday.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.860]   The last perfect bracket was destroyed by SFA.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.160]   But how about those Aggies?
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.980]   How about that?
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.420]   (audience cheering)
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.200]   That was just a shameless plug for A&M.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.700]   Every single year, no matter how hard I try,
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.300]   no matter what strategy I take, it always breaks up.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.200]   And here's what I know.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.660]   I am in good company.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.860]   And by good company, misery loves company.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.160]   So we're all in this together.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.480]   And I know that your bracket,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.100]   every single year gets broken as well.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.940]   Here's how I know that.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.000]   Because there is never once, this is crazy.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.140]   You can Google this later
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.880]   'cause it's about to distract everyone.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.480]   In the history of these brackets,
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.380]   ever been a bracket filled out that was perfect?
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.460]   It's never happened once.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.760]   Hundreds of millions of people have attempted.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.080]   Every year, people fill them out.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.820]   100 million people filled it out this year.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.900]   And every single year, it has never been successfully,
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.720]   perfectly filled out.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.500]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.740]   We have all imperfectly filled this out.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.640]   In fact, Warren Buffett has offered a billion dollars
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.880]   to the first person who can successfully fill it.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.080]   Yeah, talk about, that's a bracket that changes your life.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.980]   The first person who can successfully fill out this thing.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.340]   The odds, they say, of successfully filling it out
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.020]   are one in 128 billion.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.620]   Yeah, I know.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.460]   I know.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.600]   That we've all, and so regardless,
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.060]   if you've ever filled one of those things out,
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.960]   if you've never filled out a bracket,
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.360]   I don't even know what to say to you.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.040]   We wanna talk to you down front afterwards.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.840]   It is a 64 team thing where you just pick
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.340]   the different teams that you think are gonna win.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.100]   And every single year, no matter how hard we try,
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.740]   no matter how many times we try, we've all failed.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.180]   We all come at it and are not able to successfully do it.
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.280]   Now, the reason I start there is because I think
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.480]   this is the common human experience for all of us in life,
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.280]   that just like every single year, I come at that bracket,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.460]   I'm like, hey, this is gonna be my year.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.560]   I'm gonna take down this bracket.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.400]   It's gonna be awesome.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.820]   We're going all the way.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.020]   And then one round in, I'm like, oh, great.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.400]   Next year, that's gonna be my year.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   It's really the common experience as it relates to life.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.540]   I mean, how many resolutions do all of us make
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.740]   as we attempt to live life,
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.100]   and this is gonna be my year, 2016, it's gonna be my year.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.680]   I'm gonna stop whatever the habit
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.780]   you're trying to get rid of.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.980]   Hey, I'm not drinking anymore.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.080]   I'm not dating him anymore.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.920]   I'm gonna stop dipping.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.740]   I'm gonna stop cussing.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.040]   I'm gonna be more disciplined with my Bible.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.860]   I'm gonna exercise more, whatever that is.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.560]   And then like two weeks in, we're like, all right,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.920]   next year's gonna be my year.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.460]   Let's live a little bit.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.800]   Whatever the different thing is,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.460]   hey, I'm not gonna date that guy anymore.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.460]   I end up going back to him.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.760]   I'm not gonna drink anymore.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.660]   Oh, it's an open bar.
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.660]   I'll start that next week.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.000]   Oh, hey, I'm not gonna do whatever the scenario is.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.340]   We kind of find ourselves where no matter how hard we try,
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.740]   no matter how many times we try,
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.740]   there's something inside of us
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.240]   where we are our own worst enemy.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.280]   And we make these goals,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.340]   and then we talk ourselves out of keeping the goals.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.620]   Why is that?
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.520]   Why are we never,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.980]   or why is this consistent human experience
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.420]   where we just like unsuccessfully filling out that bracket,
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.360]   year after year, moment after moment,
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.300]   attempt after attempt,
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.860]   there's something where for most of us,
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.100]   and maybe you're the type A unicorn in the room,
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.800]   where you're like, no, I've never set a goal
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   that I haven't accomplished.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.200]   For the rest of us,
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.960]   Luke Friesen, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.140]   For the rest of us,
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.180]   that's just not the case.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.280]   And I think there's a reason why.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.940]   And especially for those of us who are followers of Christ,
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.920]   that type of approach is something
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.220]   that we experience in the Christian life.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.220]   Hey, I'm going to read my Bible more.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.420]   This year is going to be the year
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.260]   that I walk totally by faith.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.160]   My relationship with God is going to grow.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.960]   Everything's going to be amazing and awesome.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.100]   And I'm going to take ground.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.620]   And then a couple weeks in,
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.860]   we stumble, we fall,
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.000]   and we go right back to, is it even worth it?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.160]   And there's some reason behind why
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160]   that's the common experience for all of us,
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.100]   especially on the journey of faith.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.500]   So tonight, the Apostle Paul
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.400]   is going to explain what that is,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.300]   why that is,
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.140]   and really offer us a solution
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.680]   to how you and I are intended to live the Christian life
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.280]   from beginning to end,
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.580]   from beginning to end.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.960]   It's going to be found in Romans 7 and 8.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.560]   So here's why we're doing Romans 8.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.420]   Romans has been called that if the Bible was a ring,
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.300]   like a engagement or wedding ring,
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.120]   that the book of the Bible was a ring,
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.440]   that the book of Romans would be the center stone
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.940]   or the stone, the diamond in the middle.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.940]   And the highest facet with the most gleam facet
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.540]   of that diamond would be Romans 8.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.880]   It has been a book that has impacted century after century.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.840]   The Reformation began when Martin Luther
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.680]   read a passage in the book of Romans.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.080]   Romans chapter 8 has had an incredible impact.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.080]   We're going to explore what many have said
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.320]   is the greatest chapter in the entire Bible
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.120]   for the next six weeks as we walk through it,
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.860]   really slowly breaking it down.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.360]   It tells us all about the Christian life,
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.500]   all about justification, which is a big word we'll explain,
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.740]   sanctification, which is another big word,
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.400]   and glorification, what awaits us in eternity.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.140]   And so we're going to explore that
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.840]   for the next six weeks journey with us.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.480]   If you're going to memorize anything this year,
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.880]   this would be a great chapter to put to memory
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.220]   or pick a verse in there.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.020]   If you're like a chapter, did he say a chapter?
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.820]   Memorize a chapter, crazy.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.580]   Yes, put anything in this chapter to memory
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.620]   and it will be well worth your time.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.020]   So we're going to start in verse 7,
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.860]   verse 15 of chapter 7.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.220]   In order to explain where we've been,
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.860]   we're going to pick it up in chapter 7 of Romans.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.540]   The book of Romans was written to the church in Rome.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.360]   I know.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.740]   And it was a group that Paul had never met.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.940]   The city of Rome was the epicenter of culture.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.740]   It is New York City.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.520]   Paul has never met these Christians.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.380]   It's one of the very few groups that he wrote to
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.220]   that he didn't meet and have relationship with,
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.580]   but he knew how influential they would be.
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.480]   They're in the very center.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.420]   They are in New York, New York.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.720]   They're there in the heart of culture.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.200]   And so he writes the longest book that we have from Paul.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.660]   And in it, he lays out the clearest explanation
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.100]   of the Christian faith and how to live the Christian life.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.260]   And so in chapter 7,
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.660]   he's been talking about this persistent problem
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.140]   he has in his own life of not being able to do the things
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.580]   that he wishes he could do and what the problem is
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.280]   that all of us have in common.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.280]   So we're going to pick it up in verse 15
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.840]   as we dive into this incredible, incredible letter.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.420]   Chapter 7, verse 15.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.920]   If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screen.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.180]   Paul writing, says this,
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.420]   "I do not understand what I do,
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.460]   "for what I want to do, I don't do.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.500]   "What I hate, I do.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.260]   "If I do what I do not want to do,
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.700]   "I agree that the law is good."
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.460]   All of us can relate to this, can't we?
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.700]   Like we've all been in a scenario where we're like,
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.380]   "What is wrong with me?
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.100]   "I do the things that I don't think anybody should ever do.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.540]   "I don't understand myself."
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.240]   Like I do, I mean, the simplest example would be like
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.140]   driving in the car.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.300]   I don't think people should cut someone off.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.500]   I don't think you should honk the horn.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.320]   If I could honk that, I'm like,
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.680]   "What, who do you think you are back there?"
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.300]   But then I find myself and I'll be on the other shoe
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.340]   being like, "Oh my gosh, get out of the way."
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.580]   Or I will get ticked if,
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.020]   or I will end up cutting someone off
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.580]   and I always have an excuse and it's always like,
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.640]   "Look, I'm on, can I just merge here?"
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.260]   I will do the things, and not just with traffic.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.300]   We all have experienced something where like,
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.140]   we agree, hey, that's not a good way for someone to behave,
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.240]   but there's something inside of me that wants to.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.840]   I agree that people should not be greedy,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.120]   but I struggle to not be greedy.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.460]   I struggle to not want just more and more and more.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.740]   That exists inside of me.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:17.040]   I don't think anyone should lust after another man's wife
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.780]   or after someone who's not their wife,
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.460]   but I'll tell you, there's something inside of me
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.300]   that wants to.
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.360]   What is that?
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.100]   Paul says, look, that's a common human experience
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.500]   that all of us share.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.980]   There's something inside of you and something inside of me
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.020]   where we even act in a way that we would say
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.060]   no one should ever act that way, but why?
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.300]   It's still this war goes on inside of me.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.300]   He's gonna tell us why that is.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.180]   Verse 17, as it is, it is no longer I myself who do it,
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.180]   but it is sin living in me.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.940]   So he personifies and gives us the answer
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.340]   that there's this sin inside of all mankind.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.580]   And this brings us to our first idea from this text
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.980]   that your problem, any attempt to live, improve your life,
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.420]   to live out the life that you have always wanted
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.020]   to experience, the future marriage that you wanna have,
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.140]   the biggest problem you will face is you.
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.540]   You are your problem.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.440]   And Paul says, look, the problem is there's this thing
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.700]   called sin that lives inside of me,
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.520]   this war going on between my desire to please Christ
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.460]   and yet the sin inside of me.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:20.460]   He says, for I know that good itself does not dwell in me,
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.400]   that I'm not inherently a good person,
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.080]   that is in my sinful nature.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.080]   For what I have the desire to do,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.240]   I have the desire to do what is good,
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.880]   but I cannot carry it out, for I do not know,
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.300]   for I do not do the good I want to do,
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.040]   but the evil I do not want to do, this I keep on doing.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.960]   Paul says, look, the reason why you make promises
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.600]   to yourself, I'm gonna stop this,
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.680]   we're not sleeping together ever again,
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.360]   and the reason you talk yourself out of that
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.000]   is because there's this war and this battle for believers.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.960]   Paul's writing as a believer saying this war
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.680]   between what my sinful nature wants to do
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.480]   and between what Christ and my new heart,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.000]   my new spirit in Christ wants me to do.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Paul says that you and I are not inherently good.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.840]   You may have heard this before,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.220]   I just think everyone is inherently good.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.140]   Paul says, no way, you are inherently evil is what you are.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.060]   You have a sin nature, he says.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.180]   What is a sin nature?
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.380]   It means sin comes naturally.
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.500]   You've thought about this?
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.300]   Like this is why babies come out of the womb
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.660]   and they don't have to be taught to say mine,
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.980]   it just comes instinctively.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.500]   They're never like, no, this is yours,
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.480]   you take it this time.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.940]   They're always like, mine.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.940]   This is why people don't have to work at being sinful.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.780]   You've thought about this?
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.680]   Nobody's resolution this year is like,
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.080]   I am really working on being a little more angry.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.560]   No one's like, man, I just have too much peace in my life,
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.560]   I am trying to get the anxiety up.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.520]   No one experiences that because by nature,
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.200]   we are all sinful.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.720]   Our tendency, it comes natural to us.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.280]   And Paul says that's because you have a sin nature.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.240]   You don't have to work at being selfish,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.380]   it comes naturally.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.200]   That's why there's this war that goes on.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.840]   And Paul as a believer, and I think this is so huge
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.600]   because a lot of times,
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.840]   especially depending on your church experience
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.000]   and background, you may hear testimonies of people
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.280]   being like, look, I used to struggle
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.920]   and then I came to Christ and I became a Christian
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.800]   and everything changed.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.440]   And years and years and years ago, I struggled.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.700]   And Paul says, look, I'm writing the Bible
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.940]   and I'm struggling right now as a believer in Christ.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.880]   Because there's this war that goes on in me
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.460]   and I myself don't have the power to fight against it.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.080]   My spirit is willing, but my flesh is weak,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.240]   he's pointing us out.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.680]   That the problem, my biggest problem,
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.740]   your biggest problem is you.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.360]   The problem with the self-help industry,
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.480]   which is a $10 billion a year industry,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.880]   man, that writes himself help books,
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.000]   is that it involves self.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.520]   Like your biggest problem is you keep trying
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.800]   to help your self.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.640]   And you need something outside of your self
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.480]   if you are going to make progress, as do I.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.240]   And Paul's about to tell us that though
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.100]   our biggest problem is our self, there is a solution.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.360]   Verse 24, he says, "What a wretched man I am.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.300]   "Who will rescue me from this body
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.960]   "that is subject to death?"
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.440]   Verse 24, at the end of that chapter,
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.920]   that man, I keep hurting myself and I can't,
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.520]   no matter how hard I try, I can't get over it.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.000]   My problem is me.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.220]   And then he gives us the answer that it only gets better.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.080]   Verse 25, "But thanks be to God
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.560]   "who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.240]   And the solution, there is a solution, he says,
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.760]   "But it is not in you, it is in Christ."
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.820]   And he says, "What happens when you are in Christ
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.400]   "or have faith in Christ?"
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.680]   There, there is not only deliverance,
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.520]   that Christ is the thing that can deliver you
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.040]   from that internal battle,
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.660]   but not only does he deliver you,
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.600]   he also delivers you from the guilt of sin,
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.320]   of mistakes, all of that,
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.000]   of a relationship broken with God.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.340]   He says this in verse one of chapter eight.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.380]   "There is therefore now no condemnation
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.680]   "for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.880]   What may be the most beautiful verse in this whole chapter,
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.420]   that if you are in Christ,
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.060]   if you have been placed into Jesus,
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.280]   if by faith you accepted Jesus as your Savior,
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.040]   that what he, that's what it means to be a Christian is,
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.520]   hey, I'm putting my faith in what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.280]   He died in my place and he was a payment for my sin.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.000]   And then he was buried and he rose again,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.200]   even death couldn't hold him.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.240]   And his resurrection was evidence
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.160]   that the payment was enough, the check cleared.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.000]   He says, "If you have put your faith in that,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.800]   "then you have stepped into a relationship with God
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.600]   "that has no condemnation in your past,
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.780]   "in your present, in your future.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.040]   "You are now uncondemnable."
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.240]   And I really want you to hear this tonight,
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.040]   because I think most of us in the room, that sounds great,
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.120]   but in our heart of hearts, we were really honest,
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   you just don't believe it.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:58.960]   Like the right now,
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.240]   if you put your faith in Jesus perfectly,
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.160]   you are righteous, clean, pure, blameless.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.240]   When God looks at you,
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.020]   he does not judge you on the basis of your actions.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.880]   'Cause I think that's what most of us feel unrighteous
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.480]   because of, right?
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.360]   Because of the things that we've done,
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.060]   things that we're doing maybe right now.
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.320]   And what Paul says is that,
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.600]   if you have placed your faith in Christ,
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.560]   you are uncondemnable.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.400]   What does condemn me?
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.240]   Guilty.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.400]   You cannot be declared guilty.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.100]   You have been permanently declared innocent.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.840]   The righteousness of Jesus,
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.640]   the blamelessness of Jesus,
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.500]   no matter what is in your past,
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.560]   a divorce, a sexual past, adultery, abortion,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.600]   whatever it is, Paul says,
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.500]   "You are perfect righteousness."
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.320]   If you've put your faith in Jesus, you're uncondemnable.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.580]   You may condemn you, your heart may condemn you.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.460]   A religious system or a judicial system may condemn you.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.540]   But when it comes to God,
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.060]   you are uncondemnable because you're in Christ.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.480]   Your solution, our second idea from the text,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.300]   is that the solution is Christ, is in Christ.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.660]   And he transitions to why there's no condemnation.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.780]   He explains how, why this is.
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.700]   He says this, verse two.
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.020]   Because, here's why there's no condemnation.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.760]   Because through Christ Jesus,
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.820]   the law of the Spirit who gives life
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.780]   has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.860]   So Paul says, when you placed your faith in Jesus,
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.980]   something was accomplished,
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.460]   something took place, and it involves two laws.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.380]   You see what he says?
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.180]   The law of the Spirit who gives life, that's one law,
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.260]   has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.180]   The law of sin and death.
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.620]   What is the law of sin and death?
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.780]   The law of sin and death is that every time you and I sin,
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.180]   we bring death into a situation.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.180]   The law of sin and death is that the wages of sin
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.780]   or the return on sin is death.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.260]   That's Romans 6, 23.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.660]   That any time that you and I sin, we bring death.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.260]   Some of us have eroded and put death to relationships
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.300]   because we lied, we broke trust,
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.700]   and the relationship dissolved.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.820]   My parents' marriage was destroyed
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.700]   because of the law of sin and death.
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.980]   Sin stepped in and it killed the marriage.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.340]   The law of sin and death is that not only eternally,
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.980]   any time there is sin, the return for that is eternal death.
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.940]   That's the law of sin and death.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.820]   But also in this life, any time there's sin,
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.660]   there's always death.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.620]   All of us exist underneath this law.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.060]   You can put it back up there, Jordan.
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.700]   Underneath the law of the Spirit who gives life,
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.380]   a new law has been introduced.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.200]   And when you put your faith, when you became a Christian,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.740]   this new law came in and it overpowered
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.100]   the law of sin and death.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.760]   That this new law has come in and overpowered
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.020]   the old law of sin and death.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.120]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.580]   How can a law overpower another one?
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.940]   The other, last Thursday, JP and I got on a plane.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.460]   JP is a pastor here on staff who teaches,
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.060]   if it's your first time joining with us.
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.260]   We got on a plane, we flew to Missouri
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.100]   to do this thing that we were a part of.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.460]   And when we got on the plane,
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.360]   we were underneath the law of gravity.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.240]   Our bodies were being held down, pulled down,
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.020]   the plane was being held down.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.140]   All of a sudden, the plane began moving forward
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:11.140]   and a new law was introduced, the law of motion and inertia.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.020]   And it overpowered the law of gravity.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.060]   The law of gravity was still in existence,
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.820]   still pulling down, but a greater, more powerful law
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.660]   overpowered the law of gravity.
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.860]   And we were lifted up into the air as the plane took flight.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.380]   In the same way that you and I,
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.280]   underneath the law of sin and death,
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.060]   the spirit who gives life comes in for believers
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.000]   and he overpowers the law of sin and death
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.220]   and he raises your life up,
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.180]   delivering you and setting you free
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.260]   from the law of sin and death.
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.300]   Setting you free from the penalty of sin
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.980]   and from the power of sin in your life.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.180]   From the penalty that you would need to pay at the end
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.220]   and from its power in your life right now.
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.820]   That's what the law has done, Paul says.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.300]   For what the law was powerless to do, verse three,
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.300]   he begins to explain why and how more fully
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.260]   Jesus has stepped in and done what we could not do.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.120]   He says this, "For what the law," verse three,
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.600]   "was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh,"
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.780]   God did.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.620]   What the law, he's talking about Old Testament law.
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.420]   And he says, "The problem with the law,"
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.180]   and really we can broaden it to any law,
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.340]   "The problem with all laws is they're weakened
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.540]   "by sinful people or by the flesh."
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.260]   The problem with the law is I'm a law breaker, right?
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.820]   Like the problem with it is not that it's a bad law,
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.460]   is the problem is that I can't keep it
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.840]   or I oftentimes break the law.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.240]   Paul says, "The problem was the reason the law
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.860]   "could not save you."
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.560]   The reason religion doesn't work,
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.180]   and obedience and I'm gonna be a good person doesn't work,
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.620]   is because you're not a good person.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.880]   And you could try, and religion in general,
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.640]   which is vastly different from relationship,
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.980]   that's what Christianity is about.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.960]   It's not about religion,
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.220]   which is just following a bunch of rules.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.400]   The reason following a bunch of rules doesn't work,
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.740]   Paul says, "Is because of you and because of me."
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.560]   Because of sin, weakened by the flesh.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.780]   And I think there's part of me that thinks like,
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.340]   there's a very common belief in our culture that,
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.540]   yeah, look, the law is weakened.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.900]   The law can't save, I guess, kind of,
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.300]   'cause it is weakened by the flesh.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.780]   But look, if I'm a good person,
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.860]   like if I keep most of the laws most of the time,
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.740]   like that can save me, right?
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.880]   Like as long as I'm good most of the time,
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.820]   this is a very common myth that is believed.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.900]   And I wanna do my best to remove it quickly off the table
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.020]   or to quickly attempt to remove it off the table.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.140]   And the mentality goes like this,
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.340]   "Hey, if I'm a good person,
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.740]   "as long as my good kind of outweighs the bad,
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.180]   "then God will accept me and I'll go to heaven."
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.140]   Many of you in this room believe this.
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.980]   This is so illogical and I'm gonna do my best
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.980]   to explain why I think it's illogical.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.060]   That essentially says that if I follow God's law,
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.760]   you know, majority, 60% of the time,
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.060]   then the scale will move in my favor.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.560]   Then I'll be accepted, right?
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.420]   Like as long as I do good and I obey the law,
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.620]   those obedience to law or obeying the law
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.940]   will remove and discount and get rid of
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.940]   the times I broke the law.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.460]   You with me?
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.460]   Here's why that's crazy.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:19.460]   What system of justice in our universe does that work in?
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.780]   Like, think about it.
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.700]   Like what system of justice anywhere would be like,
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.700]   "Yeah, as long as you do some good things,
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.580]   "those were gonna take away some bad things."
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.900]   So like, yeah, what lawyer would stand before a judge
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.000]   and say, "Look, yes, my client shot him in the leg,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.980]   "but he's never shot someone else in the leg before.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.600]   "Doesn't that stand for something?"
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.640]   Or, "Yes, I intentionally defrauded the IRS,
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.800]   "but I have not frauded the IRS for the last six years.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.380]   "Doesn't that stand for something?"
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.660]   Like seriously, think about it.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.860]   Like it just doesn't make sense.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.180]   We think it's a scale.
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.540]   What system, like there's no nation on earth
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.200]   where you'd be like, "Yeah, that's cool.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.440]   "It's a scale system.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.060]   "You can kill people as long as you're nice."
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.540]   Like that just doesn't make sense.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.800]   But when it comes to God, that's how we think.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.100]   We're like, "Yeah, I'll just obey the law most of the time,
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.460]   "and then it'll kind of make up for any time that I haven't."
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.200]   And it's just crazy.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.880]   And Paul says the problem with the law,
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.000]   the law can't save 'cause you can't obey the law.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And if you've ever broken the law, God's law,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.520]   if you've ever not been perfect, you're toast,
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.880]   unless you're in Christ.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.500]   The law has never been meant to save,
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.340]   and the way that God saved was not by sending an easier law
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.320]   or some new rules.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.860]   He did it by a specific way, Paul's about to tell us,
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.120]   for what the law was not able to do, God did.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.680]   That God stepped in where you and I had created a gap,
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.320]   where you and I had messed up,
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.680]   and God responded, and he stepped in,
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.520]   and he did so by sending his own son, verse three,
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.680]   in the likeness of sinful flesh, to be a sin offering.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.440]   And so he condemned sin in the flesh,
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.980]   that there was this error.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.920]   Mankind had sinned against God,
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.360]   and God's response to the rebel race that is humanity,
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.080]   to the race that had sinned, had ran from him,
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.400]   had taken what he gave them, which is life,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.960]   and had used it for their own glory,
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.840]   for their own selfish desires.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.360]   And he looked at that human race,
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.000]   and he didn't respond with thunder
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.440]   and lightning bolts and anger, he runs towards them,
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.120]   he sends his own son to die on a cross,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.040]   to be brutally murdered on a cross made out of wood
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.280]   that he created, that he gave life to in form of a tree.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.940]   The whole world to be brutally executed
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.680]   by soldiers who nailed nails into his hands,
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.820]   nails that he, by his very own word,
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.500]   Hebrews one says, was holding together the universe.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.460]   He holds it together by the word of his power.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.220]   Christ became a man and died.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.340]   That was God's response to the problem
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.540]   and the dilemma of sin,
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.660]   to the error that you and I have done,
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.580]   that he steps in out of love
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.180]   for the human and the rebel race.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.180]   You will not find other teachings
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.500]   and other religions that are like that.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.660]   God is a God who enters into the world,
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.660]   does not demand something from,
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:09.500]   but gives something for people, his life.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.240]   And that was God's response,
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.280]   that it became a sin offering not to condemn you,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.220]   to condemn sin in the flesh,
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.400]   so that you would be forever made righteous.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.500]   You would be totally clean,
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:28.500]   the perfect sinless son of God says, I will take your sin.
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.420]   I will take every mistake you've ever made,
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.140]   every intentional sin, not just a mistake, an accident.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.120]   Every time you've ever snorted something,
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.480]   every time that you've ever intentionally thrown up,
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.440]   that you've cut, that you've got wasted,
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.080]   that you gave your body away,
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.440]   every lie that you've ever told,
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.620]   every sin that you've ever done, I will take them
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.240]   and I will take on the punishment for those sins
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.220]   so that you go free
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.380]   and I will be brutally killed in your place.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.320]   That's the message in the place of David,
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.420]   in the place of anyone who will accept it,
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.240]   that I will send my son, he will be the offering for sin.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.520]   He will stand in the gap that you've created
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.880]   and that I've created through air.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.080]   And that anyone who accepts him
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.200]   will be made perfectly innocent,
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.800]   stamped, declared righteous for all time.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.680]   The righteousness of Christ will be his
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.240]   and Christ will take the punishment that we deserve.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.940]   He says this in the next verse where he points out,
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.280]   "In order that the righteous requirement of the law
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.180]   "might be fully met in us."
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.420]   What is the righteous requirement of the law?
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.180]   What's the requirement of any law?
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.860]   Perfect obedience.
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.340]   The requirement of the, hey,
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.420]   click it or ticket law is click it.
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.780]   The requirement of pay your taxes by April 15th, tax day.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:48.860]   The requirement of that law is obedience,
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.500]   paying the taxes by April 15th.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.080]   The requirement of God's righteous law
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.260]   is perfect obedience to that righteous law.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.160]   And all of us who have fallen short,
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.440]   who would say I'm not perfect,
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.220]   who've created a gap, Jesus steps in and says,
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.260]   "I will live the life that you could not live
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.080]   "and I'll die the death that you deserve."
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.640]   God will step into the gap
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.380]   and pay for all the air that you and I have ever done.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.640]   That's the message of Christianity.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.480]   It's the message of Easter that's coming up this weekend.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   It's the message of all of Romans eight.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.380]   That the guilty ones will be declared pardoned
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.620]   and murder my son.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.200]   I mean, it's scandalous love
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.580]   that God expresses on a cross for humanity.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.940]   Let the guilty one go free
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.560]   and the innocent one will pay and stand in his place.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.340]   As I was preparing this message this week,
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:43.540]   I was reminded of like an illustration in scripture
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.420]   where this story,
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.300]   a scenario where like the innocent one is murdered
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.380]   and it's Jesus,
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.840]   the innocent one stands and takes the punishment
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.580]   that someone he's eyeball to eyeball with deserves.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.040]   And that person who's guilty,
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.860]   who had actually murdered people ends up walking away free.
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.680]   It's a story that's found in Luke 23
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.460]   and it's a story that's found in all four of the gospels.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.780]   I'm gonna read it really quickly
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.280]   because inside of this story, we find our story.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.560]   It's a story that's found in every gospel.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.120]   In other words, four different times this happens.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.200]   Why is that significant?
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.600]   Because very few stories are repeated
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.960]   inside of the gospels.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.720]   Very few stories make it into all four.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.420]   Some make it into two, some make it into three.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.680]   Very few make it into all four.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.520]   Why would God say,
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.840]   "Hey, I want every single one of them
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.080]   "to have this story in it."
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.400]   And it's gonna feel like, oh, that's kind of a random story,
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.360]   but there's a purpose in it.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.080]   There's a reason why God includes it.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.520]   It's a story that happens minutes
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.040]   before Jesus is about to be crucified,
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.860]   during Holy Week, which is what we're in right now.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.500]   2,000 years ago, Jesus comes riding in
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.360]   during this last week, this weekend's Easter.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.700]   Two days ago was Palm Sunday,
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.700]   and during this week, all kinds of things happen.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.620]   This story takes place minutes and hours before Jesus dies.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.300]   He's arrested and he's led away and he's falsely accused.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.180]   Men begin to make up accusations
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.860]   and basically claim this man deserves to die.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.580]   Jesus is arrested, he's brought before Pilate,
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.480]   if you know who that is, who's the governor,
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.000]   who's gonna essentially understand here
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.880]   and give this guy a trial, Jesus.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.580]   And he shows up and all of a sudden,
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.920]   this crowd begins to gather outside of Pilate's door.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.560]   And Pilate is now seeing this carpenter Jewish peasant
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.640]   and Pilate's a Roman and he's a governor
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.000]   and he's like, "What is this man doing here?
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.960]   "Why are you in front of me?
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.200]   "What crime have you committed?"
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.620]   And Jesus really doesn't give him an answer.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.280]   And Pilate goes out to the crowd
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.480]   that's now gathering around,
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   it's beginning to chant out, "Crucify him, crucify him."
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.720]   And he steps inside and he goes,
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.780]   "Crucify him, he hasn't done anything wrong.
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.440]   "You're calling for the death penalty?
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.100]   "That doesn't happen just to anybody.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.720]   "That's like giving someone the death penalty for speeding.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.560]   "That's crazy."
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.360]   No, he's not getting the death penalty.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.700]   And Pilate goes in and he begins dialogue with Jesus
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.660]   and say, "What could you possibly have done?"
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.060]   And then Pilate says, "Ah."
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.400]   Every single year, there's a chance where basically
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.600]   we let one Jewish prisoner go.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.200]   And since this guy's a prisoner, I'm just gonna let him go.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.540]   It happened at this feast every year.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.600]   So Pilate goes out and he goes,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.440]   "Look, I'm gonna use that get out of jail free card,
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.620]   "literally, and I'm gonna let this guy go
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.640]   "and everything's gonna be great."
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.720]   And in the midst of it, they begin screaming,
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   "Crucify him, give us Barabbas."
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   And the set of just what's going on is all of a sudden,
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.980]   Pilate's in front of this crowd
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.800]   that's screaming for the death penalty
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.640]   for a man that he continues to say is innocent.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.040]   And then there's this other man who's a murderer
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.820]   standing near him and the crowd begins to scream,
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.240]   "Give us the murderer and release him to us."
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.360]   Here's what happens in Luke 23.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:50.420]   Pilate basically says, "I've examined Jesus thoroughly."
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.220]   This is in verse 15.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.120]   "And I find him innocent.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.060]   "Nothing this man has done calls for the death penalty.
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.440]   "I'll have him flogged and released."
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.720]   And the crowd roared.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.680]   And they shouted with one voice, "Kill him
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.800]   "and release Barabbas to us."
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.480]   Barabbas, Luke wants us to know, was in prison
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.160]   for taking part in an insurrection against the government
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.440]   and for murder.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.280]   Who's Barabbas?
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.120]   He's not just the nicest guy on the block.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.280]   He was an insurrectious and by the way, he's a murderer.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.740]   And the crowd is screaming, "Release Barabbas,
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.000]   "but execute Jesus."
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.720]   And Pilate's going, what?
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.320]   Pilate argued with them because he wanted to release Jesus,
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.320]   but they kept shouting, "Crucify him, crucify him."
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.380]   For the third time, he demanded why?
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.320]   Like, what has this man done?
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.240]   Why would you want to kill this man, Jesus?
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.760]   What has he done?
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.920]   As Pilate looks out into the audience of a crowd
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.640]   who no doubt as Jesus did miracles in Jerusalem,
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.160]   had experienced family members, friends,
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.000]   people in their circle of connection
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.420]   whose eyes had been opened.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.700]   Literally, they were no longer blind because of Jesus.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.540]   What had he done?
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.920]   He healed blind people.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.760]   What had he done?
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.360]   He restored lepers to their family.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.760]   When he healed them, he allowed lame people to walk again.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.320]   He opened deaf ears.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.520]   What has Jesus done?
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.480]   Showed compassion for the weak,
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.180]   raised to life sick people.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.160]   What has Jesus done?
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.820]   And Pilate's going, you're gonna demand this man be killed?
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.280]   And you want to set free this murderer?
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.360]   I mean, very clearly there's guilty and innocent.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.240]   Why would you ask for the innocent to die?
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.160]   And he continues as the crowd continues to release.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.860]   "I find no reason to sentence him to death.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.700]   "I will release him."
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.440]   But the mob shouted louder and louder,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.040]   demanding him be crucified.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.760]   Their voices prevailed.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.880]   So Pilate sentenced Jesus to die as they demanded.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.040]   And he released Barabbas, the man in prison,
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.040]   for insurrection and for murder.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.680]   And he turned Jesus over to be crucified.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.680]   And they led him away, the innocent, righteous son of God.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:56.440]   As Barabbas has chains taken off of his hands,
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.620]   off of his feet, and he's set free.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.160]   Now, why is that significant for you and for me?
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.040]   Not just does it give an indication,
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.600]   an illustration of an innocent one going to his death,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.060]   dying the death that a murderer deserved.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.120]   It also tells us a little bit about our story.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.120]   What does Barabbas mean?
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.800]   What does the word Barabbas mean?
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.680]   This is why I think it was included in every single gospel.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   Because though God is sending us a message,
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.320]   I want you to see this.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.360]   What does the word Barabbas mean?
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.040]   Bar-abbas.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.320]   Bar, Simon, Bar, Jonah.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.020]   Simon, Bar means son of, Jonah.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.500]   What does Barabbas mean?
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.920]   Bar, son of the father.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.440]   I wanna paint the picture again.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.480]   Barabbas, the guilty murderer,
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.840]   the one who deserved death, is released.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.220]   The son of the father who is guilty is set free,
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.980]   escapes penalty, while the perfect, innocent Jesus
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.740]   goes to the cross to be killed.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.100]   Why does Jesus, or why does God have the story
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.340]   recorded in every gospel?
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.060]   'Cause it's your story.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.060]   If you are a Christ follower.
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.060]   You are Barabbas, I am Barabbas.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.180]   It's all of our story.
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.500]   It's the story of Easter.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.040]   It's the story of the gospel,
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.980]   where the guilty one is set free
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.020]   and declared no longer condemnable.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:17.040]   And the innocent one dies in his place.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.640]   It's the story we celebrate at Easter.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.100]   It's the story of Romans eight.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.260]   It's your story and my story,
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.300]   and God preserved it and recorded it
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.260]   so that even in the early church,
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.420]   when they would read Barabbas,
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.020]   they would immediately go, son of the father.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.300]   It's like Jacobson, Jacob's son,
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.740]   son of the father was released.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.680]   And so God wants you to know that's all of our story.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.900]   Declared uncondemnable because the righteous payment made,
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.900]   not that we deserved, but that Christ gave us.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.060]   He finishes out the text and he tells us,
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.180]   it's a payment made for all of those
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.860]   who live not according to the flesh.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.780]   What does it mean to live out the Christian life?
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.820]   It is to live not according to the flesh,
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.060]   but according to the spirit.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.620]   You may have who walk according to the spirit,
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.780]   that the life lived or walked by the spirit.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.660]   What does it mean to walk by the spirit?
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.560]   Does it mean to just live a good life?
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.880]   No.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.300]   Paul just spent a chapter saying,
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.700]   look, I can't live a good life.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.500]   What does it mean to walk by the spirit?
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.020]   Is it just mean to be a good person?
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.060]   Those are great things.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.300]   People should attempt to be good.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.460]   But honestly, if you attempt to be good in your flesh,
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.620]   you will always fail.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.020]   Many of you are trying to be good.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.460]   This is why you're having such a tough time
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.860]   living your faith out 'cause you're like,
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.380]   I'm gonna try harder tomorrow.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.580]   All right, blew it today.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.940]   Tomorrow's gonna be my day.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.300]   And you're not living consistent with walking by the spirit.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.140]   You're trying to live in your flesh.
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.780]   It's human effort.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.180]   What is walking by the spirit mean?
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.180]   How do you walk by anything?
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.280]   Dependence on.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.020]   If I said walk by this walker,
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.440]   you would put your weight on the walker
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.380]   and walk to walk by the spirit.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.500]   And this is the way the Christian life is lived.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.260]   This is the way that you and I not just escape
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:02.260]   a penalty of our sin eternally.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.320]   This is the way we live free from the power of sin
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.660]   every single day, every single moment
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.500]   is by total dependence, walking by the spirit.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.260]   I'm totally dependent on you.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.260]   I'm going to live, God, moment by moment.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.180]   I'm totally dependent on you when I'm facing temptation.
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.300]   God, I can't not lust right now,
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.180]   but you can and you can in my life.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.380]   I need your help, Lord.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.780]   I'm asking and I'm inviting you moment by moment.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.020]   You know what I'm going through.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.060]   Lord, you know how anxious I feel.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.860]   I can't conquer this anxiety, but you can.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.620]   And your spirit inside of me can.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.540]   I'm totally dependent on you, God.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.100]   I'm totally in need of you.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.740]   I can't fight this, whatever insecurity,
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.060]   whatever addiction you're facing, but you can, God.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:47.900]   I'm totally dependent on you right now, moment by moment.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.140]   That's where the power is.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.480]   That's where you can experience the Christian life.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.700]   If you try to do it on your own,
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.240]   you're not going to be able to fight against sin.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.580]   Like you're no match for sin in and of yourself.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.240]   You can't even stay on a diet and neither can I.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.080]   Think about that.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:02.920]   And you think we're going to be like,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.060]   no, I'm going to conquer this right now, right here.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.100]   The only way to access the power
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.300]   that Christ has given each of us who are Christians,
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:16.480]   to access the ability to experience that freedom from sin,
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.000]   freedom from comparison, from envy,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.860]   even freedom from shame and guilt
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.100]   and all the things that rob you of experiencing life,
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.540]   is to walk in dependence moment by moment.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.480]   God, I can't, but you can.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.860]   I'm totally dependent on you.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.100]   It's the same way you become a Christian
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.020]   is the same way you live as a Christian.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.880]   And here's what I mean.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.920]   That's not just like a pithy statement.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.960]   It's a fact.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.140]   The way you get into heaven is you go, God, I can't.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.460]   I need you to save me.
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.540]   I need a savior, not a second chance.
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.820]   I can't do it on my own.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.920]   I need you to die on a cross in my place.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.400]   I'm accepting.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.260]   Not that I'll ever be a good enough person
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.620]   because I think I'm pretty good.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:56.940]   Like I'm nicer than these people.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:57.980]   I'm not Hitler.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.540]   But the reality is I'm not good enough to get in
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.060]   because you require perfect righteousness.
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.340]   I'm totally dependent on you
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.900]   if I'm gonna get in at that standard.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.140]   And that's the standard.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.040]   I'm totally dependent on you, God.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.260]   That's the way you become a Christian.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.900]   In total dependence, you cry out
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.300]   and accept his provision in Jesus.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.740]   That's totally dependent.
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:17.580]   I'm totally dependent on you.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.680]   That's becoming a Christian.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.220]   Living the Christian life is the same way.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.700]   I'm totally dependent on you, God.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.540]   Will you help me?
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.300]   I can't, you can.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.860]   I need your help.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.780]   I'm not strong enough to fight the demons in my past.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.340]   I'm not strong enough to have the type of marriage
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.180]   that I want, Lord.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.140]   I'm totally dependent on you.
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.180]   I feel this every day.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.180]   Very practically, you're like,
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.340]   man, it's still like ethereal.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.020]   I promise you, this practically happens to me
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.180]   every single day.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:50.380]   As I look down the past of just the examples that I've had
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.280]   as it relates to parenting, as it relates to marriage,
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.300]   as it relates to just any types of sin struggles,
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.540]   and I have to confess this constantly,
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.580]   God, I can't, but you can.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.100]   I can't get up here and teach a message
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.620]   and not be obsessed about what you're gonna think about me,
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.020]   but you can, God, and your spirit inside of me
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.120]   can release me from that.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.140]   I'm crying out, I need your help.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.620]   Because you're a God who rushes in
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.680]   when we humble ourselves and just ask for your help.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.920]   Whatever you're facing right now,
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.420]   the way you live and experience freedom
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.700]   is by moment by moment.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.180]   It doesn't happen in a minute,
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.420]   or it doesn't happen like today and everything changed.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.400]   It's gonna happen tomorrow.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.140]   You get up, I can't, God.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.380]   You can, will you help me?
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.020]   I'm surrendered and dependent on you,
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.420]   and I'm gonna walk by the spirit,
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.460]   and that's where the power is.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.900]   That's where you can live out the Christian life.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:43.180]   Our posture is dependence,
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.380]   was that third whole section that I forgot to announce.
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.780]   Our posture is dependence,
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.540]   but man, that would've been really great had I.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.220]   Posture is dependence, and I'll close with this.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:42:00.160]   Last week, I got a text during Garrett's message,
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.960]   and he did such an awesome job, Garrett.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.380]   And it was somebody, yeah, get excited.
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.340]   It was texted by someone who said,
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.380]   "Hey, do you wanna go to the Mavs game tomorrow?"
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.700]   And I was like, "Yes, duh, but stop interrupting me
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.600]   "'cause I'm listening to the Bible right now."
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.000]   And I sent back, "Yes, of course,"
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.500]   and I had no idea what I was about to get.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.600]   I go and I pick up the tickets,
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.520]   and it was like a date night, and it was awesome.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.360]   This is great.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.940]   Man, I haven't been to a Mavs game in so long.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:25.940]   This is exciting.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.780]   This is gonna be awesome.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.460]   Go to the stadium, and I realized,
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.180]   oh man, there's a parking pass in here.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.000]   This is awesome.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.180]   I had pulled out cash to be able to park,
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.860]   and park at one of the lots,
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.260]   and I was like, "This is great.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.100]   "There's a parking pass."
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.380]   Not only any parking pass, it's the Lexus parking pass.
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.100]   Holla at your boy, okay, right next to the stadium.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.980]   We're gonna walk in, park, go into the stadium.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.140]   This is gonna be awesome.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:48.980]   This is so cool.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.960]   This free gift that I had accepted
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.360]   came with way more than I thought.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.920]   And so I go inside, we're looking.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.440]   I don't know where the seats are,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.560]   and we go to the gate that we're gonna be at,
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.400]   and I find the gate, and I'm like,
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.680]   "Oh, this is great, 108, this is awesome."
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.200]   And we start walking down to find our seats
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.600]   inside of the gate that we're in,
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.080]   and we keep going down the steps,
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.640]   and I'm like, "Okay, okay, this is not us."
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.400]   We keep going lower, and lower, and lower,
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.120]   and we are on the second row.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.840]   Dirk is like six inches away from me,
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.120]   and a place that I've never been in all my life,
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.380]   ever sat anywhere near this.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.340]   We are right in front.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.180]   It was crazy.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.160]   I was like, I had no idea.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.980]   All that what I was accepting when I accepted this free gift.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.900]   Do you have these free gifts more often?
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.340]   And I'm sitting there, and I'm watching this game.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.620]   Never had anything like this before.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.460]   It's so awesome.
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.680]   And I look around, and it's like such a different experience
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.520]   than I'm used to.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.700]   Like, these are not my people.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.200]   I am among like the who's who of Dallas right now,
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.380]   and I'm like, they know this is an imposter in here.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.080]   What is this man doing?
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.260]   And everyone's like really pretty, and a little plastic.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.240]   And I'm like, that's so wrong.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.700]   And I'm like, I'm sitting there,
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.440]   and the person next to me, like I just feel like,
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.220]   I don't even know, they have concessions.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.860]   Like, you don't go to the concession stand.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.420]   The concessions come to you, and I'm like,
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.860]   oh, I just feel like so, like I don't belong here.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.940]   Like, these people, I don't even know how to order,
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.220]   and I don't wanna ask them,
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.240]   'cause I'm like, my wife doesn't know how.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.940]   How do you order here?
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:16.900]   Believe this?
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:17.740]   Come on.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.620]   I'll have what she's having.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.540]   Oh man, it's just so like, man, I don't,
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.780]   at any moment, they're gonna be like,
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.100]   hey, who is this guy, Bill?
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.180]   Like, he does not make enough
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.740]   to sit down here with all of us.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:32.260]   And it just felt like such, I did not belong.
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.220]   And then it hit me.
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.460]   Wait a second.
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.300]   I do belong here.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.900]   And it's not because like I'm as pretty,
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.740]   or anything else as these people.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.560]   It's not because I earned it to be down here.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.680]   I belong down here for one single reason.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.700]   I got a ticket.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.160]   It's true.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.500]   Like, that's the only single reason
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.740]   that I deserve to be down there,
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.580]   was that I had a ticket.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.580]   It wasn't that I had tried hard enough.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.100]   It's that I had been given this free gift,
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.740]   and I had accepted that free gift,
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.740]   and it gave me access to all kinds of things
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.140]   that I did not earn.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.180]   But in accepting that free gift,
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:10.840]   it opened up and placed me in a place where I do belong.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.420]   And I was able to access and experience all types of things
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.640]   that came along with that free gift.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.560]   Now, here's why I say that,
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.340]   because many of us in the room,
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.520]   as it relates to your Christian life,
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.160]   you think that you either deserve to be down there,
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.120]   sitting in those rows because of the things you've done,
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.160]   because of the type of person that you are,
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.640]   and you have deceived yourself.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.880]   The only reason why you can stand before God
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.240]   and have a relationship with him,
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.800]   why you belong to be called righteous,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.300]   you belong among those who are called redeemed,
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.340]   saved, forgiven, forever forgiven,
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:50.540]   forever declared God's child,
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.000]   heirs of all eternity, heirs of all that is.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.460]   The only reason why you deserve that
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.080]   is not because of anything you've ever done,
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.400]   because of the gift that you've been offered
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.640]   and you have received in Christ.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.100]   If you stand before God,
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.240]   and I really wanna draw this home,
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.660]   if you stand before God,
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.060]   or if you were to die today,
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.360]   and you stood before God,
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.520]   and you were asked the question,
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.860]   "Hey, why do you think you would get into heaven?"
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.000]   And you began to go, "Well, I've been a good person.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.360]   "I pay my taxes on time.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.300]   "I always donate.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:21.260]   "I try to be nice to people.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:22.960]   "My grandma loves me."
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.480]   If you do anything that involves I, I, me,
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:30.120]   anything other than Jesus, the righteous one of God,
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.000]   who I was allowed to go free,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.120]   he was murdered in my place, I did not deserve it,
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.920]   but I am accepted, and I belong among the redeemed,
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.560]   because I've been accepted,
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.640]   because Christ has died in my place.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.040]   If you say anything, that is like me
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.640]   trying to sit on that front row every single night,
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.000]   saying, "Look, I'm a nice person.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.240]   "I deserve to be up here."
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.540]   And the reality is you do not belong up there
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:55.220]   based on your behavior, based on your performance.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.720]   But you are given access up there
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.200]   if you will just accept it.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.180]   That's the free, that's why the message of Christianity
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.640]   is unlike any other message.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.100]   That's why we take this message
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.000]   to the streets of Dallas every week,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.120]   because the world thinks that God
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.560]   wants good people in heaven and bad people in hell,
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.600]   and the message is only forgiven people go to heaven.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.760]   You are not good, and neither am I,
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.800]   and the only way to be forgiven is Jesus,
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.820]   and anyone who will just say,
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.980]   "God, I'll accept you died in my place.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.920]   "I'm just not good enough, and I'll never be good enough."
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.160]   Any person who says that, who accepts that,
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.480]   who believes that, will spend all of eternity
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:39.840]   among the redeemed, the righteous, the saints,
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.400]   the uncondemnable, and any person
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.100]   who is totally dependent like that,
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.920]   and totally dependent moment by moment,
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.200]   will experience the life God wants
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.680]   for the redeemed, the righteous,
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.400]   those who are his children, but you will never get there.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.360]   You do not deserve to sit on the second row
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.000]   except for one reason, Christ,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.940]   and he's giving you a ticket if you'll just accept it.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.440]   I'm gonna pray that we would.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.940]   Father, thank you that you are the God
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.600]   who allows Barabbas' like me
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.560]   to become sons of the Father who walk free.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.480]   You're not a God who wants religious action.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.740]   You're a God who came to establish relationship.
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:25.400]   I pray for friends in the room, God, Lord, please,
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.460]   there is no message that can save someone.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.240]   There is no message that can convince someone
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.040]   that they are living a life
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.600]   dependent on their own actions,
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.160]   even if they're feeling guilty,
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.160]   like, man, I'm just such a bad person.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.500]   They've bought the lie that you look at them
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.200]   based on how they behave,
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:50.020]   and the truth is it's not about whoever behaves,
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.760]   but whosoever believes will have eternal life
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:58.080]   and accepts that, and from that, all of life is changed.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:01.560]   Thank you, you're a God who's given us access
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.460]   to more than we could ever imagine,
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:10.460]   to eternal life and the ability to live this life
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:13.140]   by walking in dependence on you, God.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.460]   We worship you.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.180]   You lived a life that we couldn't live.
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.260]   You died the death we deserved,
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:20.760]   and we sing that and worship you now through song.
