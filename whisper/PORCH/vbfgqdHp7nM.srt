1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
 "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,480
 He makes me lie down in green pastures, He leads me beside still waters.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,400
 He restores my soul, He leads me in the path of righteousness for His name's sake.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,080
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,360
 are with me.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,400
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,080
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,760
 You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,400
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,680
 in the house of the Lord forever."

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,000
 What's up Porch, how we doing tonight?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,640
 Hey my name is Timothy Atik and I'm one of the teaching pastors here on Sunday mornings

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,800
 in here at the Porch.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,280
 If this is your first time with us, I am so glad that you made it.

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,760
 Welcome here in the room and also to everyone watching online.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,520
 I want to say hello to Porch Life, Des Moines and Tulsa, Boise, Scottsdale.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,040
 So glad that you are tuning in tonight.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,800
 It is a really important night because we're starting a new series.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,080
 It's going to last about five weeks and we are walking through the most famous chapter

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,800
 in the entire Bible.

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,080
 So even if you're new to the Bible or new to Christianity, the chances of you having

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,120
 heard the 23rd Psalm are very, very high.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,000
 And so I'm so glad that you made it.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
 It's going to be a great series.

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,200
 I want to start just by sharing with you that when I started dating my wife, Catherine,

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:49,400
 on our third date, I took her to the State Fair of Texas.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,040
 So when we were at the State Fair, I decided that there's no better way to get to know

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:02,280
 someone than by riding the Texas Skycoaster, which is the crane that lifts you up 189 feet

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,440
 in the air while you're strapped together in a harness.

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,240
 And then you pull a cord and it drops you and you swing through the sky.

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:19,520
 The reason that I wanted to do that with Catherine is because you can learn a lot about someone

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,240
 at 189 feet in the air.

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,440
 Because if you just put yourself in a position where you have no control, who you really

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,520
 are comes out.

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,520
 And so if you want to know who someone is, just put them in a place where they feel little

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,960
 control at 189 feet in the air.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,840
 I'll just tell you what Catherine learned about me while we were hanging in the sky.

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,720
 As we were being lifted into the air, I didn't choose to do this.

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,480
 I just did this involuntarily.

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,560
 I just began to sing.

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,120
 It's just what apparently I do when I feel no control.

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,240
 So as we were being lifted up, here's what I did.

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,080
 I go, "It's a beautiful day.

44
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
 Skies are all afield."

45
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,120
 That's a U2 song from a long time ago.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,640
 If you're like U-Hoo, U2, they'll change your life.

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,440
 Anyway, that's what I did while we were being raised up.

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,520
 And then when I pulled the cord and we began to swing through the sky, I began to Christian

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
 cuss.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,200
 I was going to seminary at the time.

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,560
 And so I just began to scream, "Oh my gentle Judas!"

52
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,360
 That is what came out of my mouth.

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,360
 That's what happens when Timothy Atik is not in control.

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,840
 And I tell you that because as we start this new series, it's just good to think about

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,740
 where you're at in life right now.

56
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,440
 And I just want you to think, what is the area of your life right now where you feel

57
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,480
 little to no control?

58
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,020
 Is there an area of your life where you feel little to no control?

59
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,760
 What is the one area of your life where you can't exactly see if everything is going to

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,560
 work out?

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,880
 For you, it might be your relationship status.

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,760
 It might be your job status.

63
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,640
 It might be your financial status.

64
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,160
 It could be your physical health status.

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,720
 I don't know what it is for you.

66
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,200
 But if you feel little to no control over a certain area of your life, I just wonder

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:32,120
 if we bought the video of your life's skycoaster, what would we see you doing as you grasp for

68
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
 control?

69
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,640
 Because it's interesting, when people are being raised up on that Texas skycoaster,

70
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:44,440
 it's like they begin hugging themselves, like grabbing onto the harness is going to do something.

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,400
 And when we feel out of control, we begin to panic.

72
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,920
 And so if you feel out of control in your relationship status, you might quickly settle

73
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,600
 for the wrong person because you're nervous that it's not going to work out.

74
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,000
 Like the wedding circuit has already passed through one round, and more and more of your

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,320
 friends are getting married, but you're not.

76
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,280
 Or maybe you're just in that place where you're in your second job right out of college.

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,720
 You've already gone through one, and you're getting that three, four, five-month itch

78
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,960
 where you're like, "You know what?

79
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,400
 This just isn't my dream job.

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,960
 I'm just not that happy.

81
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,800
 I need to start looking for something else."

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,000
 I don't know what it is for you.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,200
 Maybe you have a struggle with pornography, and the reason that you're struggling with

84
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,760
 pornography, it's a control issue.

85
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,920
 You're like, "I have no clue that that is why I'm looking at porn."

86
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,000
 It's because you're scared of rejection, and so you can slip into a fantasy world, and

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,520
 there is no rejection.

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,600
 It's the one place where you can control every aspect of your sexual experience.

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,000
 And so it's just good for us to dial in.

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Like if there is a video of the skycoaster of your life, whatever that area is of your

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,920
 life where you feel little to no control, how do you panic?

92
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,280
 Like what does it look like for you to panic?

93
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,040
 And what I want to do tonight is I just want to show you that there's a better way.

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,320
 We're looking at the most famous chapter in the Bible, and it was written by a guy named

95
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,960
 David.

96
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,880
 If you're new to the Bible, I guarantee you there's a good chance that you know something

97
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
 about David.

98
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,120
 David's the guy who slayed the giant with a sling and a stone.

99
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,680
 And David writes this psalm, and listen to how he starts it.

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,520
 He says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."

101
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,120
 Another translation puts it this way, "The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing."

102
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,520
 Another translation puts it this way, "The Lord is my shepherd, I have all that I need."

103
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,120
 And you might be sitting there saying, "Yeah, but he was king.

104
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,320
 Of course he had all that he needs."

105
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,720
 You just need to know exactly who's writing this.

106
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,560
 David had some high highs.

107
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,040
 Yes, he was king.

108
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,040
 Yes, he did conquer a giant, but David also lived on the run for 15 years.

109
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,240
 Like he didn't sleep in his own bed for 15 years.

110
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,840
 He was hiding out in caves because the current king was trying to kill him.

111
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,740
 His best friend was killed.

112
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,800
 His daughter was raped.

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,160
 Four of his sons died prematurely.

114
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,040
 He had to lead his country through a multiple year famine.

115
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:47,280
 And yet that guy is able to say, "The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing."

116
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,360
 And so what I'm trying to get you to understand is that David walked through life with peace,

117
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,520
 but that peace wasn't because of what he had.

118
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,520
 That peace was because of who had him.

119
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,800
 And so what I want to do is I want to invite you from panic to peace.

120
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,420
 Like whatever area of your life feels out of control, the good news is this, you don't

121
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,360
 have to be in control because Jesus Christ already is.

122
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:24,880
 And so I am inviting you from panic to peace tonight.

123
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,080
 The key is to know God as shepherd.

124
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,000
 David says, "The Lord is my shepherd."

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Have you ever thought, what does David mean when he says that the Lord is my shepherd?

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,320
 Like if we're not careful, we'll just blaze right past that.

127
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,960
 But we have to take the time to understand what does it mean that the Lord is our shepherd?

128
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,040
 That's a tough analogy because, I mean, maybe there's like one person in here who's spent

129
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,600
 some time around some sheep, but for the rest of us, it's kind of not our thing.

130
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,840
 Like we're not very familiar with sheep.

131
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,480
 And so the analogy doesn't connect, but for David, it did connect.

132
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,000
 Like you need to understand the reason that David used the imagery of the shepherd was

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,680
 because David's dad was a shepherd, but it wasn't just that David's dad was a shepherd,

134
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
 David was a shepherd.

135
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,160
 And it's not just that David was a shepherd of sheep, kings in the ancient near east were

136
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,200
 referred to as shepherd kings.

137
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
 So David shepherded the nation of Israel when he was king.

138
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,920
 But not only that, David was written into God's story.

139
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,200
 And in the old Testament, if you were to read the old Testament, you would see that God

140
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,480
 is pictured as a shepherd of his people.

141
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,000
 That's why Psalm 78, 52 says, "Then he," that's God, "led out his people like sheep and guided

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,240
 them in the wilderness like a flock."

143
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,640
 So when David used this analogy, it's like a football coach using a football analogy.

144
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,760
 Nothing makes more sense.

145
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:09,680
 In fact, David wrote just a little over half of the Psalms.

146
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,440
 And up until this point, when he refers to God as shepherd, it's the most intimate analogy

147
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,280
 that he has used of God to this point.

148
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,920
 Very intimate for David.

149
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,880
 But if we're not careful, we'll just blow past the beauty of God being our shepherd.

150
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,760
 But peace is found in knowing God as shepherd.

151
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,160
 What I hope you see tonight is this.

152
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,200
 Here's the key, don't miss it.

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,240
 His identity, God's identity as shepherd brings peace to our reality.

154
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,840
 So whatever your reality is right now, whatever feels out of control for you, wherever you're

155
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:55,160
 hitting the panic button, his identity brings peace to our reality and clarity to our activity.

156
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,320
 So who he is informs how we live.

157
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,000
 His identity brings peace to our reality and clarity to our activity.

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,280
 So we want to dial into what it means when David says, "The Lord is my shepherd."

159
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:17,520
 And the reason that we need to fight for clarity is because Jesus actually picks up the imagery

160
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,960
 of the shepherd in John 10 verse 11, when he says, "I am the good shepherd."

161
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,040
 The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

162
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,000
 So here at the porch, our hope is that you would see Jesus clearly.

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,680
 By us understanding what David means when he refers to God as shepherd, we will see

164
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:43,360
 Jesus more clearly because Jesus picks up the analogy and calls himself the good shepherd.

165
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,280
 When David says, "The Lord is my shepherd," I believe that he is saying at least five

166
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,700
 things.

167
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,880
 And I want you to understand God's identity so that it will bring peace to your reality

168
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,480
 and clarity to your activity.

169
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,720
 First, when David says, "The Lord is my shepherd," I believe that David is saying, "The Lord

170
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,560
 is my leader."

171
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,720
 The Lord is my leader.

172
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
 Why do I say that?

173
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,280
 Well, look at the verbs that David uses as he continues in the psalm.

174
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,440
 He starts out in verse one of Psalm 23.

175
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,480
 He says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."

176
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
 Verse two, watch this.

177
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,000
 "He makes me lie down in green pastures."

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Now watch the verb.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,760
 "He leads me beside still waters.

180
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,520
 He restores my soul.

181
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,240
 He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake."

182
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,920
 God is leader.

183
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,600
 In the ancient Near East, shepherds didn't drive their sheep from behind like Western

184
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,000
 shepherds do.

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,580
 No, the shepherd would go in front of the sheep and the sheep would follow the shepherd

186
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,580
 as the leader.

187
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,960
 When David says that God is leader, here's what that means for God to be leader.

188
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,080
 It means that he is in charge of the path and the pace.

189
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,760
 He's in charge of where we go and how fast we get there.

190
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,560
 So think about David's life.

191
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,360
 If you don't know much about David, he was told that he would become king of the nation

192
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,080
 of Israel at around the age of 15.

193
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,200
 Do you know what age he actually became king?

194
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,040
 At the age of 30.

195
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,440
 So for a 15 year period, do you know what the path was?

196
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,880
 The path was being on the run from the outgoing king trying to kill him.

197
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,160
 What was the pace?

198
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,840
 15 years.

199
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:34,680
 When God led the nation of Israel like a flock, what was the path?

200
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,960
 It was wandering around in the desert.

201
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,600
 What was the pace?

202
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,880
 40 years.

203
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,440
 God is in charge of the path and the pace.

204
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,560
 Another way to say it is God is in charge of the where's and the when's of our lives.

205
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,480
 And the reason that that is so important for us to identify is that the majority of the

206
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,960
 questions that we are asking that cause us stress either start with where or when.

207
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,800
 When am I going to finally meet someone?

208
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,360
 When and where am I going to meet my people in Dallas?

209
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
 Where am I supposed to get plugged in?

210
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,760
 Where am I going to live?

211
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,040
 Where am I going to work?

212
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,720
 Where am I supposed to invest?

213
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,580
 When am I going to get out of debt?

214
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,040
 When am I going to start feeling better?

215
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
 When am I going to get a better job?

216
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,000
 When am I going to finally figure out what I'm supposed to do with my life?

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,440
 It's the where's and the when's that cause us stress.

218
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,000
 These are questions about the path and the pace.

219
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,760
 If you are frustrated with God right now, you're probably frustrated about his leadership

220
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,680
 because he's in charge of the path and the pace.

221
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:59,520
 You don't like where he's leading you and how fast he is leading you there.

222
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:06,480
 We moved to Dallas from College Station right at the end of 2021.

223
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,920
 So we showed up to Dallas basically January 2nd of 2022.

224
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,240
 And I'm just being straight up honest with you guys, 2022 was the hardest year of my

225
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
 life.

226
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,360
 Hardest year of my life.

227
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,520
 We loved our lives in College Station.

228
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,560
 We loved the ministry that we were a part of in College Station.

229
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,240
 We were content in College Station and God interrupted our lives and he called us to

230
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
 Dallas.

231
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,960
 Like, it was just so abundantly clear that we were supposed to leave what we were doing

232
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,480
 in College Station and come to Dallas.

233
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,720
 And we came to Dallas.

234
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,400
 And man, we just faced one challenge after another.

235
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,560
 We had housing issues.

236
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,240
 We had schooling issues.

237
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,840
 We had significant issues on several different fronts.

238
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,080
 Some stuff if I share with you, you'd be like, that's crazy.

239
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
 Truly.

240
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:12,400
 And there were moments during 2022 where I found myself talking to God as honestly

241
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,520
 as I could saying, why did you call us here?

242
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,960
 Do you know what it is a question of?

243
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,640
 It is a question of the path.

244
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,640
 God, I don't like the path that you have us on.

245
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,400
 I like the place where you had us and now you're leading us on this path which is filled

246
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,680
 with trials, filled with heartache, filled with confusion.

247
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,400
 It's a question about the path.

248
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,280
 Fortunately in 2023, he's led us to greener pastures.

249
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:50,600
 But man, I know what it is like to struggle with the path or the pace.

250
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,280
 But I still remember sitting right there on that front row during a worship service and

251
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,920
 we began to sing the goodness of God.

252
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,640
 And it says, your goodness is running after me.

253
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,200
 That's a line from Psalm 23.

254
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,400
 And it was in that moment that I realized that all of 2022, the hardest year of my life,

255
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,320
 God's goodness was chasing me the entire time.

256
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,320
 Which is pretty cool to think that God was going before me because he was my leader.

257
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,280
 And yet somehow he was coming behind me with his goodness.

258
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,120
 And so I was able to trust him as my leader, even though I didn't like the path and I didn't

259
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,360
 like the pace.

260
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,280
 Some of you guys are trying to decide if you should trust God's leadership by looking at

261
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,000
 the path and the pace.

262
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,120
 But you've got to flip it.

263
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,960
 You have to learn to trust the path and the pace from looking at the leader.

264
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,240
 Don't look, don't flip it.

265
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,240
 Don't figure out if you'll trust the leader by looking at the path and the pace.

266
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,560
 Look at the leader so that you know you can trust the path and the pace.

267
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,680
 You can trust the character of God.

268
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,160
 God's identity informs our activity.

269
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,120
 He is leader.

270
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,000
 So we follow.

271
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,640
 When David says, the Lord is my shepherd, he is saying, the Lord is my leader.

272
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,920
 The second thing that David is saying when he says the Lord is my shepherd is he's saying

273
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,520
 the Lord is my owner.

274
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,080
 Now that's weird wording.

275
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,080
 Where do I get that from in scripture?

276
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,880
 Okay, because I'm not just going to throw out opinions to you.

277
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,320
 Like we stand on the word of God here at the porch because we think that God has gone to

278
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,800
 great lengths to give us his words.

279
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,680
 So where I find that is in John chapter 10, which is the most thorough passage where Jesus

280
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,080
 picks up the analogy of being the shepherd.

281
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,520
 He says in verse 11 that he is the good shepherd.

282
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,480
 Now watch this in verse 12 of John chapter 10.

283
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,760
 Jesus says, he who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, he who is a hired hand and not

284
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,360
 a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees.

285
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,600
 And the wolf snatches them and scatters them.

286
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,920
 He flees because he's a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.

287
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
 I'm the good shepherd.

288
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,640
 I know my own and my own know me.

289
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,560
 Jesus is talking about ownership.

290
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,040
 He says, look, the hired hand, the hired hand does not what?

291
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
 He does not own the sheep.

292
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,440
 The shepherd owns the sheep.

293
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,600
 To say that the Lord is my shepherd is to say the Lord is my owner.

294
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,640
 Now I want you to see the correlation that Jesus makes between ownership and care.

295
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,200
 Because he says that the hired hand doesn't own the sheep, but he says he flees because

296
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,680
 he's a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.

297
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,160
 So because he doesn't own the sheep, he doesn't care about the sheep.

298
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,840
 So the inverse must be true.

299
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:03,280
 For the shepherd to own the sheep means that the shepherd cares about the sheep.

300
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,040
 And here's the reality.

301
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,360
 This is just the way things work in our world.

302
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,880
 When you own something, you are the one who cares about it the most.

303
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
 That's the reality.

304
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,200
 When you own something, no one cares more about it than you.

305
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,400
 Like I'll give you an example from my life.

306
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,720
 When we lived in College Station, I would drive to Houston to speak a lot.

307
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,240
 And I left a speaking engagement.

308
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,800
 It was on a Wednesday night.

309
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,200
 I had not eaten dinner.

310
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,840
 I was driving back to College Station.

311
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,600
 It's about an hour and 15 minute drive.

312
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,040
 And I was super hungry.

313
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:47,000
 And so I Google Maps to Chick-fil-A. And so I found a Chick-fil-A on Highway 290 in Cyprus.

314
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,120
 And it said that Chick-fil-A closed at 10 o'clock.

315
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,240
 And my map was showing that I was going to arrive at 958.

316
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,280
 So I was coming in hot, people.

317
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,040
 Needed a 12 count, some sweet tea with two Chick-fil-A sauce and two ketchup.

318
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,960
 So I'm coming in hot.

319
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,560
 I come around the corner.

320
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,040
 I come around the corner into the parking lot.

321
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,080
 I can see the drive-thru at the end.

322
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,160
 And I am making my way to the entrance of the drive-thru.

323
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,880
 And out of the corner of my left eye, I see a high school kid in a red shirt sprinting

324
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,000
 across the parking lot.

325
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,440
 And I'm like, life goes into slow motion at that point where I'm like trying to figure

326
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,960
 out what is happening.

327
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,240
 I'm driving to the drive-thru.

328
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,240
 Small man in a red shirt sprinting across the parking lot.

329
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,800
 And then I realized he's racing me.

330
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:52,800
 And he's trying to beat me there to put a cone in the entrance to keep me from getting

331
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,080
 my 12 count and the sweet tea.

332
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,640
 So what did I do?

333
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,280
 I floored it.

334
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,400
 I floored it across the parking lot.

335
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,640
 I beat him to the entrance.

336
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
 I rolled down my window.

337
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,200
 I said, were you racing me?

338
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
 He goes, yeah.

339
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
 I was like, cool, man.

340
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
 Sorry.

341
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,760
 And I pulled around and I ordered.

342
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,920
 But in that moment, do you know what I was reminded?

343
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,280
 I was reminded that kid does not own Chick-fil-A. He doesn't.

344
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,320
 He is not an owner.

345
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,800
 Because I've interacted with multiple Chick-fil-A operators.

346
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,080
 I've even had a chance to talk to Dan Cathy for two minutes.

347
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,560
 And it is clear if you talk to someone who operates or owns Chick-fil-A, it is very clear

348
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,120
 that they care about their customers and chicken.

349
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,720
 They care deeply.

350
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:54,360
 It is their pleasure to care about their people.

351
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,440
 Because that's what owners do.

352
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,200
 Owners care the most.

353
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,240
 To know Jesus as your shepherd is to know the one who cares the most about your life.

354
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,360
 So I just want to say something and it's just going to fly past some of you and then some

355
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,480
 of you it's going to hit you between the eyes and it's the one thing God brought you here

356
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,860
 to hear.

357
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:26,300
 No one cares more about you than Jesus Christ.

358
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:34,420
 Jesus Christ cares more about you than you care about you.

359
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:42,900
 Like he cares more about you than even you care about yourself.

360
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:51,260
 So that's why Peter's words in 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 7 should be what some of you take

361
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,020
 as your application for tonight.

362
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020
 Because what does he say?

363
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,180
 He says cast all your anxiety on him.

364
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,380
 Why?

365
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,860
 Because he cares.

366
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,140
 Because he cares for you.

367
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,260
 Cast all of your anxiety.

368
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,220
 So whatever that area is of your life where you can't see around the corner, you don't

369
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,540
 know how it's going to turn out, you can't control the outcome, whatever that thing is,

370
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,060
 cast all of it on his shoulders.

371
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,540
 Take it off of your shoulders, drop it on his, his shoulders are far more sturdy than

372
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:30,820
 yours are, you can walk in freedom that you don't have to carry it because he cares for

373
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,500
 you.

374
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,220
 The Lord is your owner.

375
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,580
 But it's not just that the Lord is our leader or our owner.

376
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:45,340
 Verse 3 when David says the Lord is my shepherd is he's saying the Lord is my provider.

377
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,460
 He's my provider.

378
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,020
 That's why David is able to say in verse 1 the Lord is my shepherd.

379
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:55,140
 I shall not want, I lack nothing.

380
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:01,260
 So remember the Old Testament positions God as a shepherd who led the nation of Israel

381
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,980
 like sheep.

382
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,300
 Well God led them through the desert for 40 years.

383
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,820
 How did God provide for them?

384
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,240
 Well he made a deal with them.

385
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,700
 He said here's the deal.

386
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:20,100
 If you want to eat, like if you want food to eat, here's how things are going to work

387
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,280
 in my economy.

388
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,060
 You're going to wake up in the morning and there is magically going to be food for you

389
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
 to eat.

390
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,740
 It's just going to appear.

391
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,980
 But only take what you need for that one day.

392
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,700
 Don't save anything.

393
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,300
 Don't store it up.

394
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,940
 Don't get out any Tupperware and pack stuff up.

395
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,700
 You eat what you need and then you trust that when you wake up the next morning there will

396
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,540
 be more food.

397
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,620
 What did the Israelites do?

398
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,220
 They tried to stockpile it.

399
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,860
 That's what we do.

400
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:04,300
 They tried to stockpile it just in case God's buffet closed for cleaning one day.

401
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,700
 And so it begins to get moldy and has bugs growing in it.

402
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:16,740
 How long did God expect them to operate with that type of provision rhythm?

403
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:24,700
 Exodus 16, 35 says the people of Israel ate the manna 40 years.

404
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,740
 For 40 years God expected the nation of Israel to just trust that when they woke up in the

405
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:34,200
 morning he as their good shepherd would provide for them.

406
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,500
 It makes sense now that when Jesus teaches us to pray the Lord's Prayer, what does he

407
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,020
 teach us to pray?

408
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,900
 Give us this day our daily bread.

409
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:51,340
 Like Jesus wants that type of relationship with us where we need him to daily show up

410
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,980
 and provide in our lives.

411
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,140
 Here's the issue though that we have.

412
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,660
 We believe that peace and joy is found in control.

413
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,660
 Like we believe that our greatest peace and our greatest joy will be found when we feel

414
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,060
 in complete control.

415
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,340
 And Jesus is like, no joy isn't found in control.

416
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,840
 Joy is found in dependence.

417
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:21,580
 Your greatest joy is found in Jesus showing up in significant ways in your life.

418
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,880
 But we don't want to trust.

419
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,920
 So just think about it, when the pandemic hit, like if you remember like the first week,

420
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:37,000
 it was March 2020, like when the world went like, went bananas, like everyone lost their

421
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,920
 minds.

422
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
 What did everyone do?

423
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,800
 They went to the stores and what's the one thing everyone bought?

424
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,240
 Toilet paper.

425
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,960
 People were like, I can't live without toilet paper.

426
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,520
 Like I'm not going to lose a sock.

427
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,760
 I am going to buy, I don't care if anyone else has something to use when they're going

428
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,760
 to the bathroom, but I'm buying the whole shelf because if I've got to go into hibernation

429
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:12,660
 for the next decade, I'm going to have three squares per moment for 10 years.

430
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,160
 And that's fine.

431
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,360
 I mean, that's fine if a pandemic hits and you want to stockpile toilet paper and bottle

432
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
 water, you can.

433
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,520
 But there are certain things you cannot stockpile in this life.

434
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,600
 Like you can't just stockpile like job offers.

435
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,640
 You can't just stockpile people who want to marry you.

436
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:43,640
 Can't just, some of you are like, I can, that's a problem.

437
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,560
 Can't stockpile everything.

438
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,920
 You will have to trust the Lord to provide.

439
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,800
 And that's where joy is found.

440
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:01,720
 So when we were moving from college station to Dallas, we decided like at the end of November,

441
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,880
 we were actually going to come to Dallas.

442
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,320
 And then we decided we were going to try and get here for our kids to start school by January

443
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
 2nd.

444
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,840
 And some of you are like, oh man, that, that gave you a whole month to pack up the back

445
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
 of your car and move.

446
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,000
 No, people got three kids.

447
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,400
 It, it took like two 26 foot long trucks to move the Atik family.

448
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,920
 This isn't like popping the back window and just putting some stuff in.

449
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,720
 So we found ourselves in a place where we needed to sell our house really quickly.

450
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,160
 We needed to find a house really quickly and we needed, we were looking for a learning

451
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,360
 different school for one of our kids and we had none of those things.

452
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,940
 We were trying to sell our house in two days before we were going to put it on the market.

453
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:56,160
 Some guys came to fix our wood floors and this guy ruined, like we were trying to replace

454
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,920
 just two feet of wood from the door to here.

455
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,800
 He started chopping wood back here and then I watched him stop and realize that he had

456
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:11,760
 made a mistake and we have this massive divot in our floor two days before we're going to

457
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,360
 put it on the market.

458
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,720
 Then we tried to find a house to buy and it was at the point where the market was at the

459
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,920
 peak and there was nothing for sale.

460
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,600
 And then I came to Dallas and I visited six different learning different schools for my

461
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,920
 kids and none of them were a fit.

462
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,160
 So I called the public school and they were like, we don't have room for them.

463
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,160
 We'll have to send them to a different public school temporarily.

464
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,480
 And I was like, God, what are you doing?

465
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,840
 Like this makes no sense.

466
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,480
 You called us to go to Dallas.

467
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,740
 I've got a divot in my floor.

468
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,740
 We can't find a house to buy and there's no place to, not even the public school can take

469
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,180
 my kid.

470
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,140
 And it put us in a place where God had to provide.

471
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:01,660
 So God worked a miracle and some other wood company came, replaced the floor.

472
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,860
 An elder at a church made a phone call and there just happened to be someone renting

473
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,260
 a house, few streets from the public school we were hoping to go to.

474
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,380
 And then the public school called me back and said, we've got a space for your kid.

475
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,800
 And each of those things happened in the short period of time.

476
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,740
 And it was all the Lord just saying, wait and watch.

477
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,820
 Don't panic.

478
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,120
 Just wait and watch.

479
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,900
 It makes me think of John chapter six, where Jesus feeds the 5,000.

480
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,100
 He asked his disciples a question.

481
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,900
 He says, where are we going to get enough food to feed all these people?

482
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,060
 And I love what the text says.

483
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:49,380
 It says, he asked this knowing, he asked us to test them because he knew what he was going

484
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,460
 to do.

485
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,140
 That's so encouraging.

486
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,940
 He said this to test them, knowing what he was going to do.

487
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,940
 I just wonder if there's times where God's like, oh my gosh, where are you going to get

488
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
 a job?

489
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:10,220
 Where do you even get those?

490
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:18,660
 And I just wonder how many moments in our life, like the, the parentheses reads, he

491
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:24,900
 said this to test you because he already knows what he's going to do.

492
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:34,580
 Our job is to wait and watch, is to trust in our Lord who is provider.

493
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:40,780
 Here is the reality, and I need you to hear this.

494
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,820
 You might not always have what you want, but you will most certainly always have what you

495
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,580
 need.

496
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,980
 You might not always have what you want.

497
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,980
 You might not.

498
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,020
 You might not always have what you want, but you will most certainly always have what you

499
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,020
 need.

500
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:03,700
 And some of you are like, wrong, wrong, because I don't have what I need right now.

501
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,540
 And I would just say, you might not have what you think you need, but just remember Jesus

502
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,540
 cares more about you than you care about you, which means God knows what you need more than

503
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,340
 you even know what you need.

504
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:23,100
 So the fact that I know that he has given you what you need is explained by you being

505
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,620
 here tonight.

506
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,860
 The fact that you're still standing.

507
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,700
 Some of y'all might be like, but I'm hanging by a thread, but you're still hanging by a

508
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:42,220
 thread because God has given you this day's bread.

509
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:48,020
 And tomorrow he will be enough for what you need tomorrow.

510
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,300
 And if you ever question God as a provider, all you have to do is read what Jesus says

511
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,140
 in at the end of John 10, as he still uses the shepherd imagery.

512
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,820
 He says, my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me.

513
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,900
 Watch this verse 28.

514
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,020
 I give them eternal life.

515
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,820
 I give them eternal life.

516
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,140
 They will never perish.

517
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,780
 No one will snatch them out of my hand.

518
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,140
 My father who has given them to me is greater than all.

519
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:18,260
 No one is able to snatch them out of the father's hand.

520
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,260
 He has given you what you need most.

521
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,980
 What do you need most?

522
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,380
 Him.

523
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:35,340
 Everything you need is found in having Jesus and being had by Jesus.

524
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:41,500
 And when you put your faith in Jesus, he gives you eternal life, life with him.

525
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,100
 So when David says, the Lord is my shepherd, he's saying the Lord is my leader, saying

526
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,420
 the Lord is my owner, the Lord is my provider, but he's also saying the Lord is my protector.

527
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,580
 The Lord is my protector.

528
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,640
 Remember the most famous story about David.

529
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,140
 It's where he conquers Goliath.

530
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,220
 Well, why was David even at the battlefield?

531
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,680
 Because David was about 18 years old at the time and you had to be 20 years old to fight

532
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,740
 in the army.

533
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:17,180
 David was there because he was basically his dad's chicoterie board boy.

534
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,440
 His dad, you're like, what does that even mean?

535
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
 What is that?

536
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,660
 And where do you get them?

537
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,280
 David's dad says, here's some cheese and some bread.

538
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,460
 Go feed your brothers who are at war.

539
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,100
 So he's basically the cart boy.

540
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,260
 Shows up with some cheese and bread.

541
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,740
 And while he's there, he hears Goliath taunting God's people.

542
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,700
 He says, this is a problem.

543
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,020
 I'm going to do something about it.

544
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,680
 And so he goes and he stands before the king and tells the king that he wants to do something

545
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
 about it.

546
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,220
 And Saul, the king is like, look, you don't stand a chance.

547
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,020
 You're a kid.

548
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
 That guy's a champion.

549
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,540
 He's a warrior.

550
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,300
 Listen to what David says because he uses shepherd imagery and it gives us some explanation

551
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,940
 about what it means for the Lord to be our shepherd.

552
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,700
 David said to Saul, your servant used to keep sheep for his father.

553
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:18,660
 And when there came a lion or a bear and took a lamb from the flock, I went after him and

554
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,580
 I struck him and I delivered it out of his mouth.

555
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,060
 And if he arose against me, I love this.

556
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,780
 This is such a boss thing to say.

557
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:31,260
 He says, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him.

558
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,420
 That is something I will never be able to say in my life.

559
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,700
 Like I grabbed the beard of a lion and dropped him.

560
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,860
 It's amazing.

561
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,020
 But what's his point?

562
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,620
 His point is I'm the protector of my sheep.

563
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:51,620
 So when David says the Lord is my shepherd, he's saying, you're my protector.

564
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,740
 Just as I would protect my sheep, you protect me.

565
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:01,140
 And when we know Jesus is our shepherd, he is our protector.

566
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,020
 Because what David did to that lion is what Jesus has done to Satan, sin and death.

567
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,700
 When Jesus Christ went to the cross and declared, it is finished.

568
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,420
 And then when he was put in a tomb, and then especially when he walked out of that tomb,

569
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:21,620
 it was him grabbing Satan, sin and death by the beard, striking them and killing them,

570
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:29,180
 delivering the death blow that will resound throughout eternity.

571
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,660
 Jesus Christ is our protector.

572
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,940
 He went to the cross to deal a death blow to Satan, sin and death.

573
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,460
 So the victory has already been won.

574
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,580
 Like it's March Madness right now.

575
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,620
 Satan is basically that guy who looks at the score, he's like, I've already lost, but I'm

576
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,980
 just going to foul as much as I can on the way out.

577
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
 He's already lost.

578
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:56,460
 He's just trying to foul until the end.

579
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,580
 So my encouragement to you is to get behind Jesus, your protector.

580
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,420
 You're like, well, what does that look like?

581
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:07,300
 Well, there's three practical ways that Jesus offers us protection.

582
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,060
 Number one, he gives us his word.

583
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:15,940
 He gives us his word so we can know his ways, so we can walk in his will.

584
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,800
 And his will is described as being good, pleasing and perfect.

585
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,320
 Number two, he gives us his spirit.

586
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,740
 God actually comes and lives inside of us.

587
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,820
 And the spirit of God is active and has every intention of living a life through us that

588
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:40,460
 is marked by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, faithfulness, gentleness.

589
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,900
 And then the last one's huge, self-control.

590
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,620
 And then God has given us his people so we can gather here on Tuesday nights and Sunday

591
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,540
 mornings and we can remind ourselves of what is true, but then we can leave here and we

592
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,340
 can walk together through life and we can encourage each other.

593
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:02,660
 We can go to battle for one another and we can hold each other up.

594
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,540
 We can remind one another of what is true so that we can walk in victory.

595
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,540
 He is our protector.

596
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,260
 So if you feel beat down by sin right now, maybe you're living with the schema in your

597
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,860
 mind, I'm a failure.

598
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,180
 There's no way out.

599
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,380
 I will never break free from this.

600
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,580
 What a lie from the pit of hell.

601
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,220
 Because when you say, "I'll never be free from this," no, Jesus Christ, when you put

602
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:34,180
 your trust in him, he already freed you from the penalty of sin and he actually freed you

603
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,020
 from the power of sin.

604
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,380
 It's just that we keep putting the chains back on.

605
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,100
 And Jesus is saying, "No, drop them.

606
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,820
 Take them off."

607
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,100
 But that might mean you changing your relationship with his word, changing your relationship

608
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:55,260
 with his spirit where you actually begin to wake up every day and say, "Spirit, fill me.

609
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,260
 Fill me full.

610
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,100
 Bear the fruit of self-control in my life."

611
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,740
 And it might mean changing your relationship with God's people where you allow yourself

612
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:07,660
 to be fully known and fully loved.

613
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,820
 Finally, when David says, "The Lord is my shepherd," he's also saying, "The Lord is

614
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,580
 my physician."

615
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,980
 The Lord is my physician.

616
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,420
 There's a guy, Philip Keller, who wrote a book, "As a Shepherd."

617
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,580
 He himself is a shepherd.

618
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,140
 He wrote a book on Psalm 23.

619
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,700
 Here's what he said.

620
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,900
 He said, "Sheep require more than any other class of livestock, endless attention and

621
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,420
 meticulous care."

622
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,700
 It's no accident that God has chosen to call us sheep.

623
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,980
 The behavior of sheep and human beings is similar in many ways.

624
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:44,540
 Our mass mind or mob instincts, our fears and timidity, our stubbornness and stupidity,

625
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:50,820
 our perverse habits are all parallels of profound importance.

626
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,060
 When David says, "The Lord is my shepherd," he's saying, "Look, the Lord is my physician.

627
00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:02,500
 He is, he's the one who deals with the hurts and habits of my own life."

628
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,780
 And so let me just say this.

629
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,400
 Like God sees you.

630
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,780
 He sees all of you.

631
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,540
 You can't hide from God.

632
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,380
 You don't want to hide from God.

633
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,940
 But God isn't coming for you in judgment.

634
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:24,940
 If you know him, he wants to bring you in and heal what is broken in your life.

635
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:31,260
 And if you don't know him, like turn to him today.

636
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,700
 Because if you don't, there will come a day of judgment.

637
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:40,540
 But today he is inviting you into relationship with him and he wants to be your physician.

638
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,260
 Because we all have things in our lives that are broken.

639
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,460
 You're like, "What in my life is broken?"

640
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,460
 Let me ask you this.

641
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:53,700
 If, if everything you do, the clothes that you wear, the way that you talk, the car that

642
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:00,340
 you drive, if it is all to win people's approval, can't we agree there's something broken with

643
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,580
 that?

644
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:11,580
 Like if, if, if it does not take much for you to lose control of your temper and you

645
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:17,420
 rage like on a dime, can't we agree there's, there's something, there's something broken

646
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,420
 there?

647
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,500
 If, if you look in the mirror and all you see is something negative, you only see the

648
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,180
 negatives in your life.

649
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,860
 Can't we agree there, there's something broken there?

650
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,940
 If you regularly lie, exaggerate, or tell half-truths about who you are, what you have,

651
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,740
 or what you've done to make yourself look better than you really are, can't we agree

652
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:43,380
 there's something, there's something busted there?

653
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:54,700
 If you use guys or you use girls to make yourself feel significant, invaluable, you're using

654
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,700
 another person.

655
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,820
 Can't we agree there, there's something busted, broken there?

656
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:05,180
 If you continue to do things that you don't want to do, you continually run to porn or

657
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:09,940
 alcohol or drugs or whatever it is for you, can't we agree there's something broken there?

658
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:16,860
 I don't say that to shame you, I, I say that to call you to your good shepherd who wants

659
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,300
 to be your physician.

660
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,700
 And we all have something broken and we all need healing.

661
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,180
 And it is his joy to heal us.

662
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,580
 God wants you to know him as your shepherd.

663
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,860
 His identity is what brings peace to our reality and clarity to our activities.

664
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,620
 So because he is leader, look, because he is leader, we don't have to figure out the

665
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,280
 future now.

666
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,020
 We don't.

667
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:50,700
 Because he is owner, we can rest tonight in the fact that he cares more than we care about

668
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
 ourselves.

669
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,100
 Because he is provider, we can rest in the fact that we might not always have what we

670
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,860
 want, but we will certainly always have what we need.

671
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:10,580
 Because, because he is protector, we can, we can look to his provision for us, of his

672
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:15,620
 word, of his spirit, of his people, and we can take steps towards victory.

673
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:25,020
 And because he is physician, we can step out of brokenness into healing.

674
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,900
 Would you know your good shepherd tonight?

675
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,820
 And then I'll, I'll finish just by saying this.

676
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:36,740
 Some of you tonight, like my hope is that for the majority of people, you're going to

677
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,620
 leave here and this week, all throughout the week, you're going to find yourself just whispering

678
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,620
 under your breath.

679
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,380
 And especially when you feel stressed out or you begin to panic because you're not in

680
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,020
 control, my hope is that all throughout the week, under your breath, you're going to find

681
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,740
 yourself saying, "The Lord is my shepherd.

682
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,820
 The Lord, the Lord is my shepherd.

683
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,820
 I shall not want."

684
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,700
 You're going to put it on your, your home screen.

685
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,620
 You're going to tape it to your computer screen.

686
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:01,780
 You're going to put it all over, all over the place, on your mirror, on your dashboard,

687
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,860
 just to remind yourself, "The Lord is my shepherd.

688
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,220
 I shall not want."

689
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:13,020
 But some of you tonight just need to realize that you can't say with full integrity, "The

690
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,860
 Lord is my shepherd."

691
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,380
 You might be able to say, "The Lord is a shepherd," because you just heard a message about Jesus

692
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:28,260
 being shepherd, but you can't say with authenticity, "The Lord is my shepherd," because you've

693
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,300
 never put your trust in Jesus Christ.

694
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,300
 You've never turned from your sin and put your trust in Jesus.

695
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,220
 And so maybe God brought you here tonight simply so that you could hear the words of

696
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,780
 Isaiah 53 6.

697
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,780
 It says, "All we like sheep have gone astray.

698
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:49,300
 We have turned everyone to his own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us

699
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,300
 all."

700
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,300
 What does that mean?

701
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,600
 It means that every single one of us has wandered away from God in sin.

702
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,660
 And because of our sin, we deserve eternal separation from God.

703
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:05,900
 But the good news is Jesus in John 10 11 says, "I am the good shepherd."

704
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,500
 The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

705
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:20,660
 What's interesting is Jesus, as the good shepherd, laid his life down as a lamb without blemish.

706
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:25,580
 And he was the good shepherd by becoming the lamb that would take away the sins of the

707
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,580
 world.

708
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:31,380
 He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and on the cross he bore all of our sins.

709
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:36,100
 He was put in a tomb, and on the third day he walked out of it, conquering Satan's sin

710
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,820
 and death for all those who had put their trust in him.

711
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,300
 If you don't know him, then my encouragement to you is to come to him in faith tonight

712
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,140
 and invite him into your life to be your good shepherd.

713
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:51,500
 To know Jesus as Savior is to know him as shepherd.

714
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
 Let's pray together.

715
00:46:52,500 --> 00:47:09,180
 Lord Jesus, if there is anyone in the room right now who does not know you, then I pray

716
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:14,180
 that they would just sense in this moment that you are calling them by name.

717
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,180
 John 10 says that.

718
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,340
 "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow me."

719
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:25,580
 I pray that right now someone would hear your voice just calling out to them to come and

720
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,440
 follow you.

721
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,980
 And I pray that they would receive you as Savior and experience complete forgiveness

722
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,980
 of sins.

723
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,060
 Lord Jesus, I thank you that you are in fact a good shepherd.

724
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,300
 I pray that we, your sheep, would do business with you right now and our weeks would look

725
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:46,100
 different because we submit to your leadership and we rest in the fact that you are our owner.

726
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,580
 You care about us the most.

727
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:51,580
 You're our provider and our protector and our physician.

728
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,100
 So do a great work in our lives.

729
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,620
 May we not just leave here unmoved or unchanged.

730
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,940
 Speak to our hearts now.

731
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,940
 We love you.

732
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,700
 In Jesus' name, amen.

733
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,040
