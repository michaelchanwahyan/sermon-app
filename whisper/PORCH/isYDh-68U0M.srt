1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 (dramatic music)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:20,920
 - Porsche, how we doing?

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,840
 (congregation cheering)

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,520
 Come on, come on.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,440
 Hey, if we don't know each other, my name is JP,

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,480
 Jonathan, Percluta.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,080
 It's a privilege to be with you tonight as we continue.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,480
 Jonah, if you're tuning in from somewhere else,

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,600
 listening in your car, watching online,

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,440
 I wanna welcome you.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,680
 And we know there's campuses all over the country

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,920
 that are tuning in as well.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,920
 And so we're so excited that you guys are listening

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,760
 in Fort Worth.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,580
 We love you.

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,420
 We know that you're close.

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,560
 Houston, we love you too.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,840
 And so just excited to be where we are at this evening.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,520
 And I gotta start with a little bit

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,100
 of a disclaimer for you, okay?

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,640
 So I have not always been walking with Jesus,

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,480
 neither have you,

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,960
 but especially in college, I was not walking with the Lord

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,600
 and didn't know Christ.

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
 I was not a Christian.

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
 And so as I tell you this story,

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,720
 the story I'll open with, it's a little bit crazy,

28
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,720
 but there's a reason that I start here.

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,800
 And so my buddy and I,

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,080
 just as indicative of not being a Christian,

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,000
 we were going to South Padre for spring break.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
 And so that's where we wanted to go,

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,400
 Padre for spring break.

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,960
 And we wanted to do all the things that you do in Padre

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,800
 on spring break.

36
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,040
 And so we go down there, it's me and him.

37
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,000
 And I don't know if you remember this,

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,400
 I don't know where you're at in your faith journey.

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,040
 If you can remember,

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,760
 if you were even not a Christian as an adult,

41
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,800
 but you can remember just kind of being with your boys

42
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,680
 or being with your girls,

43
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,360
 you got your crew and you're ready

44
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,560
 for whatever comes your way.

45
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,460
 'Cause you guys just, that's how you roll.

46
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,760
 That was me and him.

47
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,840
 He was a big dude, like worked out a lot.

48
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,700
 And was like on steroids and stuff.

49
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,320
 And so they called us the number 10

50
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,360
 'cause I was like the one skinny guy

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,760
 and he was the big zero.

52
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,400
 And so we go to Padre, we stay at Motel 6 there

53
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,480
 and we go clubbing one night.

54
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,000
 All right, and so we're in the club,

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,240
 Louie's backyard and we're partying up at Louie's

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,820
 till late in the night and we're leaving the club

57
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,240
 and somebody comes up to him and they say,

58
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,960
 "Hey, yo, what's up man?

59
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,920
 "You know where we can score some eggs."

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,280
 And so he just kind of snaps into character

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,320
 because this is what we did.

62
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,640
 We were always looking for an adventure all the time.

63
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,000
 He snaps into character, he's like,

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,160
 "What, you're just gonna ask me this in public,

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,000
 "in front of everybody?

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,740
 "Hey, come over here, JP, you're not gonna believe this guy

67
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,600
 "what he just asked me, come over here."

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,280
 And he takes him across the street

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,800
 and he's like, "So what are you looking for?"

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,360
 And the guy's like, "Man, I'm looking for like 10 tabs

71
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,160
 "of molly, 10 tabs of eggs.

72
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,360
 "You know, you guys got some?"

73
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,260
 He's like, "Man, we can get you,

74
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,980
 "but don't just be coming up to me in public, you know?"

75
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,760
 And I'm like, "We can, we can get, what?"

76
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
 (congregation laughing)

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,040
 Didn't know that, but he's just messing with the guy, right?

78
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,880
 And he's like, "Yeah, no."

79
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,480
 "So you're looking for 10 tabs, okay, yeah,

80
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,780
 "we'll get you, why don't you meet us

81
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,960
 "in that Kroger parking lot in two hours?"

82
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,320
 Which was like, you know, four in the morning or something.

83
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,380
 And so he's like, "Meet us in that Kroger parking lot

84
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,440
 "in two hours."

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,240
 And so we, and we walk away, and then we're like,

86
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,400
 "Okay, now we gotta figure out what X looks like."

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,400
 And so we remember we met this guy at the Motel 6 earlier,

88
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,720
 and he looked like somebody

89
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,080
 that might know what it looks like.

90
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,980
 And so we went, his name was Craig, we said,

91
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,840
 "Hey, Craig, man, let me ask you a question.

92
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,680
 "You know what X looks like?"

93
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,200
 He's like, "Dude, I know what X looks like."

94
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,240
 He's like, "Call me Craig Dog," that's what he said.

95
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,040
 And, and so he's like, "It looks like,

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
 "it looks like Sudafed."

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,200
 And I'm like, "Bingo."

98
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,340
 So we go to the, we go to the gas station,

99
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,680
 and we buy some Sudafed.

100
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,640
 I know, don't do this at home, okay?

101
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
 Like I've lost half of you.

102
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,120
 You're like, "I thought I was in church."

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,160
 Listen, so don't do this, but we go,

104
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,520
 we go get 10 tablets of Sudafed,

105
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,660
 and we go and we meet this guy.

106
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,780
 He's there in his Jeep Wrangler,

107
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,540
 and I pull up and he's like happy to see us.

108
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,500
 And I said, "Hey, you know, I gotta check you

109
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,740
 "and make sure you don't have a wire."

110
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,260
 'Cause that's what I've seen on TV, you know?

111
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,220
 And so dude's like up against the car,

112
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,540
 I'm like searching him,

113
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,300
 and I'm like, "Yo, Matt, he's good," you know?

114
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,980
 And so my buddy comes up and we give him, you know,

115
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,660
 the 10 tablets of Sudafed.

116
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,980
 I told you it was a crazy story.

117
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,340
 10 tablets of Sudafed, he hands us a bunch of money,

118
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,840
 and then we leave, and we're like, we're laughing,

119
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,640
 you know, the whole way back to the hotel.

120
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,080
 We're like, "Man, this is crazy,

121
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
 "'cause you know, he thinks he's rolling on X,

122
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,660
 "and really he's just got clear sinuses and stuff."

123
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,720
 And so, and so we're like, you know, we did this.

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,920
 And don't do that at home.

125
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,540
 I'm telling you, this is not a good story,

126
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,000
 not something to replicate.

127
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,500
 And so the next day we wake up and our tires are flat.

128
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,760
 And I'm like, "Matt, he's coming for us, man.

129
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,800
 "He's got friends, dude, we gotta figure this out."

130
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,600
 So we literally flee to Mexico.

131
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,200
 I'm not kidding, like we run to Mexico.

132
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,640
 I'm not, like, we're like, "Hey, we gotta get away.

133
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,920
 "We gotta let things calm down here in America.

134
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
 "Let's go to Mexico."

135
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,240
 And so we get in the car, we get the tires fixed.

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,520
 We spend the morning doing that and hiding.

137
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,400
 And then we get in the car, we drive to Mexico,

138
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
 and all day we're just thinking,

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
 and we're running, you know, and we're scared.

140
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,280
 And we're like, "Man, what are these guys gonna do?"

141
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,720
 If they, see, that was, it was funny when we were drunk,

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,560
 but now it's like, what are we gonna do?

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,000
 These guys, what are they gonna do to us if they find us?

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,180
 And we're running, right?

145
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,640
 And we're running, and this season of my life I was running,

146
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,880
 but it wasn't from some drug dealers.

147
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,960
 It wasn't from some drug users.

148
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,720
 I was running from my calling.

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,620
 I was running from my purpose.

150
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,160
 I was running from everything that God had for me.

151
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,360
 I was running from the goodness of God.

152
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,160
 I was afraid that I would get caught,

153
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,820
 not just by some drug users,

154
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,240
 but by the Lord God Almighty.

155
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,760
 I was paying Him lip service,

156
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,420
 even going to church sometimes, even singing sometimes,

157
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,600
 maybe raising a hand in worship.

158
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,720
 Meanwhile, running from Him to South Padre,

159
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,040
 to bars, to clubs, to relationships, to dead ends.

160
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,920
 I had the heart of a runaway.

161
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,880
 We're in Jonah.

162
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,480
 And Jonah, if there's a runaway in scripture,

163
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,840
 we covered it in chapter one.

164
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,080
 DeMar and Garrett have done a great job

165
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,760
 taking you as tour guides through this book of Jonah.

166
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,480
 Showing you that this guy is running

167
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,180
 from God's best for him.

168
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,520
 And so if you're just here with us

169
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,600
 for the first time tonight,

170
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,480
 we're gonna be in chapter four,

171
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,700
 but I'll give you a quick recap.

172
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,280
 Chapter one, God comes to Jonah and says,

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
 "Hey, I want you to go to Nineveh

174
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,380
 "and tell them that they have sinned against me.

175
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,280
 "Call them to repentance."

176
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,260
 And Jonah says, "No, thank you.

177
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,300
 "I hate the Ninevites.

178
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,080
 "They're Assyrians.

179
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,280
 "They are the great, great, great, great, great,

180
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,500
 "great, great cousins of ISIS, the Taliban."

181
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,120
 Right there by Mosul, Iraq.

182
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,480
 He's like, "I'm not going there."

183
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,880
 So he gets on a boat and he flees to Spain.

184
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,600
 He's like, "I'll go on a vacation in Spain."

185
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,820
 He's running from Spain.

186
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,760
 God sends a storm.

187
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,300
 Sovereign over the weather, storm comes.

188
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,760
 Jonah is found sleeping in the bottom of the boat.

189
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,600
 How can you sleep at a time like this?

190
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
 "Hey, why is this storm here?"

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,140
 He's like, "I think it's me."

192
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,880
 They're like, "Throw him overboard."

193
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
 All right, a big fish comes and swallows him.

194
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,360
 Don't get caught up on the fish.

195
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,920
 It's just like God called him an Uber

196
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,320
 to get him where he needs to go.

197
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,280
 And so the fish shows up, swallows Jonah.

198
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,320
 Jonah's in the fish for three days.

199
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,100
 Fish throws him up on the shore three days later.

200
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,400
 And the people of Nineveh,

201
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,680
 Jonah walks through with five words in the Hebrew.

202
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,880
 It's five words.

203
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,800
 God is going to bring judgment in 40 days.

204
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,600
 That's his message.

205
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
 God's going to judge you in 40 days.

206
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,780
 And the people of Nineveh listened to him and repented.

207
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,420
 They sat in sackcloth and ashes.

208
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,260
 Their heart grieved before the Lord.

209
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,300
 They turned from their ways.

210
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,860
 And so you see now Jonah, now in contrast with chapter one,

211
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,280
 Jonah's doing all the right things, but with the wrong heart.

212
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,020
 He still has the heart of a runaway.

213
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,240
 He doesn't love these people.

214
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,460
 He doesn't love God.

215
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,360
 He doesn't want God's best for anybody.

216
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,500
 Jonah cares about him.

217
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,600
 That's it.

218
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,160
 And so as we move through this chapter,

219
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,360
 we're going to see how the rebellious heart

220
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,800
 of a runaway seeks to control,

221
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,020
 how the rebellious heart of a runaway seeks comfort,

222
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,300
 and how the rebellious heart of a runaway

223
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,800
 has misguided concerns.

224
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,440
 If you're here and you're like, man, I'm a good person.

225
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,960
 You know, I've never been to the bar or the club

226
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,800
 or drunk or doing X or selling X

227
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,640
 or selling Sudafed like it was X or sleeping around.

228
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,540
 I never done any of those things.

229
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,200
 But your heart is still hard

230
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,580
 and you still have the heart of a runaway.

231
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,760
 And you need to hear this message.

232
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,080
 And maybe you're here and you're like, dude,

233
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,520
 I did Molly this past weekend, man.

234
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,420
 You don't know me.

235
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,600
 I came in here, I'm hiding in the back.

236
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,520
 And I'm glad you're here.

237
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,400
 I'm glad you're here.

238
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,960
 You're running and God's faster.

239
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,240
 And he's going to catch you in the most beautiful way.

240
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,760
 His grace is going to catch up with you

241
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,040
 in the most beautiful way.

242
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,320
 In chapter three, it ends,

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,360
 when God saw what the Ninevites did in their repentance

244
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,840
 and how they turned from their evil ways,

245
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,180
 he relented and did not bring on them

246
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,160
 the destruction he had threatened.

247
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,360
 This is the most successful missionary

248
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,080
 that maybe had ever lived up until now.

249
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,240
 He walks in with five words and the entire city,

250
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,120
 600,000 people repent, but to Jonah, chapter four,

251
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,720
 but to Jonah, this seemed very wrong.

252
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,560
 Why?

253
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,480
 Because he's a racist.

254
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,320
 He hates the Ninevites.

255
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,280
 He hates them.

256
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,680
 He knows that they have been called to,

257
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,800
 or he's heard the prophecy that they're going to come

258
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,080
 and conquer Israel.

259
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,960
 And he hates them.

260
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,000
 He knows, he's heard how they skin people alive,

261
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,440
 how they're wicked people, and he hates them.

262
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,840
 But to Jonah, this seemed very wrong and he became angry.

263
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,640
 He prayed to the Lord, isn't this what I said, Lord,

264
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,960
 when I was still at home?

265
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,200
 That is why I tried to forestall,

266
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,340
 that means tried to keep from happening,

267
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,040
 by fleeing to Tarshish.

268
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,280
 I knew you are a gracious and compassionate God,

269
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,240
 slow to anger and abounding in love,

270
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,600
 a God who relents from sending calamity.

271
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,080
 Now, Lord, take away my life,

272
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,480
 for it is better for me to die than to live.

273
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,040
 He's complaining that God is gracious and abounding in love

274
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,180
 and slow to anger.

275
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,000
 He's actually quoting what God says about himself

276
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,380
 in Exodus 34, after he's led the Israelites from slavery.

277
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,520
 He's freed them.

278
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,660
 And God says this about himself,

279
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,520
 that he's a gracious and compassionate God,

280
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,120
 slow to anger, abounding in love,

281
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,160
 one who relents from sending calamity.

282
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,360
 But he also says this in Numbers 14,

283
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,480
 also in Nehemiah 9, in Psalm 86, in Psalm 103,

284
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,960
 in Joel chapter two, the same description, God is gracious,

285
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,320
 slow to anger, abounding in love, compassionate.

286
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,600
 This is the God you serve.

287
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,860
 This is the God who loves you.

288
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,320
 The God of the Old Testament, God of the New Testament,

289
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,400
 same God.

290
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,760
 And the Lord replied, is it right for you to be angry?

291
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,500
 See, and if you just read in chapter one,

292
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,520
 you'd think the reason Jonah doesn't wanna go to Nineveh

293
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,880
 is because the Assyrians there, they're gonna kill him

294
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,860
 and they're wicked savages.

295
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,680
 But the reason he doesn't wanna go to Nineveh

296
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,280
 is 'cause he knows that if he goes,

297
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,800
 that God is gonna show them mercy,

298
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,600
 and he doesn't want them to have mercy.

299
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,720
 He wants to control the situation.

300
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
 That's why it says he went to Tarshish.

301
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,540
 And he's disappointed in God because God did

302
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,220
 what God says he's going to do,

303
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,600
 and he's angry that he didn't get revenge,

304
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,680
 that he didn't get to control the situation.

305
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
 He's angry he's not in control.

306
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,680
 And he did what many do when they realize

307
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,520
 they're not in control.

308
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,640
 He wants to die.

309
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,680
 That's the last thing that he can control is his own life.

310
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,180
 And so the rebellious heart of a runaway seeks to control.

311
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,920
 That's my first point today.

312
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,000
 The rebellious heart of a runaway seeks to control.

313
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,080
 Here's what you need to know, friends.

314
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,360
 You're not in control.

315
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,320
 God is in control, and you don't want to resent

316
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
 the one who is in control,

317
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,000
 because when you begin to resent the one who is in control,

318
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,800
 you stop seeing his goodness.

319
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,080
 You stop seeing him as good.

320
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,360
 This is the craziest verse,

321
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,320
 potentially in the entire Scripture.

322
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,400
 I knew that you were a gracious and compassionate God,

323
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,360
 slow to anger, and a bounty in love.

324
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,200
 Wah!

325
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,440
 He's whining about how good God is.

326
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,840
 It's so weird.

327
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,080
 Have you ever been disappointed with God?

328
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,120
 And maybe now you even see purpose in it.

329
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,040
 I don't know if you lost a friend,

330
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,320
 and now you see, oh man, they weren't any good for you,

331
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,880
 or you start to see God's purpose,

332
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,720
 but when you're hurt,

333
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,840
 you can't see God's purpose through your hurt.

334
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,160
 You can't see God's purpose through your pain.

335
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,480
 I've heard this, like, maybe a relationship,

336
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,000
 maybe that's an idol for you,

337
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,040
 is a relationship.

338
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,880
 I've talked to people, you know, multiple stories,

339
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,840
 not any one of you, over and over.

340
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
 You know, somebody comes up,

341
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,960
 "TP, I can't believe I'm so mad at God."

342
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,000
 Why are you mad at God?

343
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,040
 "Because I got in this relationship with this guy,

344
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,880
 "and I thought he was good, and he had a Bible,

345
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,960
 "and he knew some verses,

346
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,880
 "and then he just took advantage of me,

347
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,400
 "and like, why didn't God show me?

348
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,680
 "Why didn't God tell me?

349
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,880
 "And I just don't understand why God let this happen."

350
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,200
 Let me ask you a question.

351
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,160
 Did you guys sleep together?

352
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,520
 Did you guys sleep together?

353
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,640
 Was it physical?

354
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,160
 Yeah, yes.

355
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,200
 Are you in community?

356
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,360
 Did your community group say,

357
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,560
 "Oh yeah, man, he's the one for you."

358
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,640
 No, I mean, you know, when the relationship

359
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,520
 came into my life, it just became kind of consuming,

360
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,200
 and so I didn't have time for community,

361
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,080
 and church, and I just was so focused on the relationship.

362
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,920
 Hey, my hunch is, my hunch,

363
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,360
 I'm just gonna go out on a limb here,

364
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,960
 that God is in heaven, jumping up and down,

365
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,800
 waving his arms, saying,

366
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,080
 "Hey, he's no good for you.

367
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,720
 "He's no good for you, don't do that."

368
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,040
 But you just didn't listen.

369
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,040
 And now, as you walked into obedience

370
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,240
 to a place of pain, you're mad at God?

371
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,200
 That's what's going on here?

372
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,780
 It's God's fault that you didn't listen?

373
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,440
 This problem is God's fault?

374
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,400
 Hey, and can I tell you something great and amazing?

375
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,320
 God is abounding in love.

376
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,480
 And so if I saw one of my daughters

377
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,960
 in a relationship that was not good for her,

378
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,160
 I would wanna do everything in my power to take it away.

379
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,280
 And this is gonna be one of the best things

380
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,400
 that ever happened to you.

381
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,800
 You just can't see it right now, past your hurt,

382
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,580
 past your pain.

383
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,280
 God has a purpose in it.

384
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,940
 So often, our hardships,

385
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,360
 they're the biggest blessings, right?

386
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,240
 But not always, right?

387
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,680
 Sometimes, they're only hurt.

388
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,920
 As I talk to people, they say,

389
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,680
 "Man, I'm so mad at God.

390
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,980
 "He took my mom.

391
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,480
 "I'm so mad at God.

392
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,240
 "I don't want anything to do with Him.

393
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,080
 "He took my dad.

394
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,680
 "He took my brother, my cousin."

395
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,760
 And I hate that, man.

396
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,920
 Part of the human experience is the pain of loss.

397
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,720
 And I wouldn't say this in that moment, right?

398
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,820
 I can say things to the many of us

399
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,520
 that I wouldn't say in a pastoral moment

400
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,240
 where I just would wanna sit with someone in their hurt

401
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,480
 and grieve with them and cry with them and weep with them.

402
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,680
 But to you, I'd say,

403
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,180
 it's a little bit of a weird concept

404
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,340
 if you think about it for a minute, right?

405
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,280
 Because everyone who's been born dies.

406
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,660
 I mean, God just did what He does for everyone.

407
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,540
 Like, everyone dies.

408
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,100
 And really, you're not mad that God took your mom.

409
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,780
 You're mad that God took her before He took you.

410
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,860
 You're mad that He took her

411
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,900
 before you agreed with His timing,

412
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,220
 before you approved His timing.

413
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,380
 That's really what you're mad about, right?

414
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,680
 And I hate the grief

415
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,600
 that comes with the pain of loss.

416
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,260
 But can I tell you something?

417
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,920
 As lovingly as I can, I wanna tell you something.

418
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,320
 I want you to hear me lean in and think about this.

419
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,420
 God's never hurt you.

420
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,280
 God's never offended you.

421
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,040
 You don't need to forgive God.

422
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,960
 He's never done anything against you.

423
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,360
 Everything that He does to you is out of love.

424
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,080
 It is what is best for you.

425
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,880
 And maybe the greatest thing

426
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,020
 that you could believe and learn right now is that,

427
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,980
 that a good, holy, righteous, perfect Father

428
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,920
 only gives good gifts to His children.

429
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,940
 And so if what you have is not good,

430
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,960
 He's not done.

431
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,800
 Hold out and trust Him.

432
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,320
 He's got a purpose in it.

433
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,440
 See, when you seek to control, you miss out on God's calling.

434
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,600
 When you start to ask the question,

435
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,280
 God, what do you want to do with me in this situation?

436
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,380
 That's what you can ask.

437
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
 It may hurt, but you're like,

438
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,220
 okay, God, what are you teaching me here?

439
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,520
 What do you want me to see here?

440
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,740
 What do you want me to do here?

441
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,940
 What is my purpose in this?

442
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,500
 And when you start focusing on your control,

443
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,820
 you miss out on God's calling.

444
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,780
 And if you've ever been in a place where you're like,

445
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,520
 God, I don't like where this is going,

446
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,960
 that's you seeking to control.

447
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,060
 I don't like where this career is going.

448
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,460
 Calm down, God has a purpose in it.

449
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,800
 I don't like where this is going.

450
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,980
 I don't like where I'm, how long am I gonna be single?

451
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,820
 Hold on.

452
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,080
 Hold on, God's hand's not off the wheel.

453
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,100
 He's still sovereign.

454
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,820
 He's still in control.

455
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,580
 See, in Sal Padre, I was running from God's calling.

456
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,820
 And I thought it was awesome,

457
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,740
 but let's all that craziness aside,

458
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,780
 what's cool about that?

459
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,820
 That's lame, man.

460
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,520
 Sold some guys some Sudafed, stole from them.

461
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,780
 That's not living.

462
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,160
 Nothing amazing about that.

463
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,800
 Like you go with my old boys,

464
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,460
 like that's the story they're gonna tell you.

465
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,520
 That's like the trophies.

466
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,840
 They're like, man, you remember the time in Padre?

467
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,200
 That was crazy.

468
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,140
 No, it was stupid.

469
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,040
 That's the truth, it was stupid.

470
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,180
 No, I remember that time in Haiti

471
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,200
 when we hiked that mountain,

472
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,240
 we sat under that waterfall

473
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,280
 and there was that voodoo temple

474
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,120
 and we got to share the gospel

475
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,640
 with that dude who was sacrificing that snake.

476
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,600
 That was crazy.

477
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,240
 Remember that time when we went into Africa

478
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,680
 and then we drove six hours into the bush

479
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,440
 and we got there and we talked to that person

480
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,800
 who trusted Christ because of a dream they had?

481
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,080
 That was crazy.

482
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,880
 That time in Padre, that was stupid.

483
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,120
 Wasn't life.

484
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,920
 I was in my control, not his control, right?

485
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,580
 Wasn't surrendered to God.

486
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,200
 Jonah hates these people.

487
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,720
 He doesn't think they deserve God's grace.

488
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,040
 Who do you think God doesn't,

489
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,680
 how can we empathize with Jonah?

490
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
 I don't know who it is for you.

491
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,640
 I don't know who you hate.

492
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,720
 Maybe it's Aggies or maybe it's Republicans

493
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,720
 or Democrats or Trump or the KKK, right?

494
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
 We don't like those people, right?

495
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,160
 Racist.

496
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,360
 And you might think, well, they don't deserve heaven, right?

497
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,720
 Whoever it is for you, like ISIS, okay?

498
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,500
 Like cutting off, sawing off the heads of Christians.

499
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,000
 Don't give them grace.

500
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,440
 Like that, they would be ISIS.

501
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,000
 That would be the equivalent.

502
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,320
 So we would be like, God, no, no, no.

503
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,580
 Don't give them abundant riches forever in your kingdom.

504
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,680
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not that.

505
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,180
 You guys know who Jeffrey Dahmer is?

506
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,560
 Maybe the most notorious serial killer in America's history.

507
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:17,080
 17 victims that he raped, that he butchered,

508
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,200
 that he ate, that he did things

509
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,160
 that honestly I can't even say up here.

510
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,040
 That horrific, that grotesque.

511
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,480
 He was evil in every sense of the word.

512
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
 A wicked, wicked man.

513
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,340
 And you know where he's at right now?

514
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:47,000
 As best I can tell, with Jesus,

515
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,720
 in his kingdom forever, enjoying your inheritance.

516
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,080
 How do you feel about that?

517
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,600
 Any part of you like, no, no, no, no.

518
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,120
 He doesn't deserve that.

519
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,180
 Neither do you.

520
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,960
 You see that?

521
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,880
 You deserve that.

522
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,320
 It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

523
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,920
 Neither do you.

524
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,240
 It's grace, the essence of grace,

525
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,600
 getting something great when we deserve something harsh.

526
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,400
 Jesus, Jesus gave up his control.

527
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,960
 He didn't seek to control the situation.

528
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,120
 He said, not my will, but thy will be done.

529
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,200
 Verse five, Jonah had gone out and sat down

530
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,760
 at a place east of the city.

531
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,000
 There he made himself a shelter and sat in its shade

532
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,040
 and waited to see what would happen to the city.

533
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,280
 He's still hopeful that God's gonna destroy the city.

534
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,840
 He's like, okay, like he sets up shop and he's watching,

535
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,040
 he's gonna be entertained.

536
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,320
 He's like, please God, bring your wrath, bring your wrath.

537
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,680
 Then the Lord God provided a leafy plant

538
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,640
 and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head

539
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,720
 to ease his discomfort.

540
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,880
 And Jonah was very happy about the plant.

541
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,240
 But at dawn, the next day, God provided a worm

542
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,860
 which chewed the plant so that it withered.

543
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,080
 When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind

544
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,520
 and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint.

545
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,680
 He wanted to die and said,

546
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,120
 it would be better for me to die than to live.

547
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,280
 But God said to Jonah,

548
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,880
 is it right for you to be angry about the plant?

549
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,760
 It is, he said, and I am so angry.

550
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,840
 I wish I were dead again, wanting to die again,

551
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,200
 like an adolescent or complaining,

552
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,840
 whining like a five-year-old.

553
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,120
 God sends a plant to protect him.

554
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,920
 God sends a worm to kill the plant.

555
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,980
 Here's what's going on.

556
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,440
 The Ninevites repent and God has mercy on them.

557
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,220
 Jonah's angry and wants to die.

558
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,320
 God covers his shelter with a leafy plant.

559
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,040
 Jonah is happy and wants to live.

560
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,720
 The plant dies, Jonah is hot.

561
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,360
 Jonah wants to die again.

562
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,920
 He's dramatic, right, back and forth.

563
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,920
 His happiness is determined by his comfort.

564
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,220
 You know anyone like that?

565
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,240
 Like if he's happy or not,

566
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,300
 depends on what's going on around him.

567
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:12,040
 He doesn't want to be uncomfortable.

568
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,840
 He's weak in his spirit.

569
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,720
 He has no fight, only whine.

570
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,680
 Whine, whine, whine, whine, whine.

571
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,760
 You know, today it's Holy Week.

572
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,600
 Moving toward Easter this weekend,

573
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,640
 and on this day, what we reflect on

574
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,680
 is it's the day that Jesus stood

575
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,120
 outside the city of Jerusalem

576
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,940
 and wept over the people who had not repented.

577
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,020
 That's where we're at in Holy Week today.

578
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,480
 But contrast that with Jonah.

579
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,960
 We see him set up outside the city.

580
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,080
 He's got his feet propped up.

581
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,040
 He's looking to be comfortable

582
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,200
 and he's ready to be entertained.

583
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,040
 And I would just tell you,

584
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,200
 the rebellious heart of a runaway seeks comfort.

585
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,360
 That's my second point.

586
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,440
 The rebellious heart of a runaway seeks comfort.

587
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,080
 Not to be on mission for God, but to be comfortable.

588
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,040
 To spend your 76 years

589
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,120
 as comfortable as you can with a security system

590
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,120
 and a 401K and a good career

591
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,080
 and some kids maybe.

592
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,880
 You know, maybe a boy and a girl,

593
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,080
 or maybe two girls and a boy.

594
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,120
 I don't know where you're at with that.

595
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,520
 You know, and maybe a German Shepherd

596
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,040
 or a Golden Doodle or something.

597
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,840
 And you know, out in the suburbs, right?

598
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,280
 'Cause that's when you're gonna cross, you know,

599
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,880
 the 635 or wherever you're at, Fort Worth and Houston.

600
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,120
 And so it's just like, it's like, I wanna be comfortable.

601
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,760
 Guys, let me tell you something.

602
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,600
 Let me tell you a story.

603
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,440
 People ask all the time,

604
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,800
 "Hey, how did you know you wanted to go into ministry?

605
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,040
 How did you, JP, how did you know

606
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,880
 you wanted to go into ministry?

607
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,760
 Can I tell you something?

608
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,320
 I never wanted to go in ministry.

609
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,040
 Never, never even crossed my mind.

610
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,400
 Never even thought about it for one second,

611
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,680
 not one time, never once.

612
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,960
 When I graduated from college, I moved to Dallas.

613
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,840
 I was in corporate America.

614
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,960
 I was climbing the corporate ladder.

615
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,500
 I was in business development for a Fortune 15 company.

616
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,960
 I saw my career path.

617
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,280
 I wanted my boss's job and then his boss's job.

618
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,620
 It was very clear to me what I wanted in life.

619
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,900
 And I experienced some success there, but I also met Jesus.

620
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,720
 I walked into a church, hung over, sat in the back row,

621
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,080
 and God came into my life, invaded my heart,

622
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,440
 and began to turn it upside down.

623
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,500
 He began to have me fall in love with him.

624
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,340
 I began to fall in love with Jesus.

625
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,100
 And I remember sitting at my desk.

626
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,940
 I was there at my desk, and I was on my computer,

627
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,120
 and I was reading the scriptures.

628
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,880
 And I heard, and I can't explain this, okay,

629
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,940
 I'm just gonna tell you what I experienced.

630
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,960
 I heard the voice of God say,

631
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,220
 "You're going to come and work for me now."

632
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,440
 I had never heard that.

633
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,560
 You know, it wasn't something super familiar to me.

634
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,440
 It doesn't happen all the time,

635
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,280
 and very rarely, I would say,

636
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,680
 but this particular day, what it seemed like

637
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,280
 is that I heard God say, "You're going to come work for me."

638
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,660
 I shut my laptop, and I walked out at 1.30 in the afternoon,

639
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,360
 and I got in my car, and I drove home,

640
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,540
 and I called a friend, and I said,

641
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,500
 "Dude, you're not gonna believe what just happened.

642
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,580
 "You gotta meet me at my house."

643
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,420
 He's like, "I'm at work."

644
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,240
 I said, "No, you gotta leave.

645
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,280
 "You gotta come to my house.

646
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,120
 "Meet me at my house."

647
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,800
 He did at two o'clock in the afternoon.

648
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,000
 We're sitting there, and I'm like,

649
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,840
 "Man, the Lord spoke to me, bro.

650
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,340
 "He said I'm gonna come work for him now.

651
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,640
 "I guess this means I gotta go into ministry."

652
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,200
 I don't know what that looks like.

653
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,120
 Never thought about working for the church.

654
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,960
 True story, never thought about it.

655
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,320
 I said, "I guess I'll hire an attorney,

656
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,140
 "start a not-for-profit organization,

657
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,200
 "raise money, and give it away.

658
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,640
 "I'll be like the Christian United Way.

659
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,120
 "That's what I'll do."

660
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,440
 And he said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."

661
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,120
 Was a good member of my community group.

662
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,180
 Said, "Hey, hold on, man.

663
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,660
 "If this was God,

664
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:44,680
 "then you should ask him what he wants you to do.

665
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,700
 "Like, if he's gonna tell you

666
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
 "you're gonna come work for me,

667
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,060
 "you should say, 'Well, God, what is my job?'"

668
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,080
 And I thought, "Well, that makes sense.

669
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,920
 "That makes sense."

670
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,160
 So I started praying.

671
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,080
 Say, "God, would you put me where you want me

672
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,860
 "and help me find contentment there?"

673
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,100
 Still have not considered the church.

674
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,300
 God, put me where you want me

675
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,420
 and help me find contentment there.

676
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,220
 Put me where you want me and help me find contentment.

677
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,580
 On the fifth day, the church called.

678
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,380
 The church, Watermark Community Church called me.

679
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,340
 Guy's on the other end of the phone,

680
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,840
 "Hey, I've got a job I think you should consider."

681
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,820
 What, who, who, who is this?

682
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,900
 Yeah, I'm at Watermark,

683
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,320
 and I'm looking over this job description,

684
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,300
 and I was praying about who should do it,

685
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,760
 and your name came to mind.

686
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,180
 I said, "What?

687
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,400
 "The church?

688
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,740
 "I can't, I don't go to seminary.

689
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,780
 "I can't work at the church.

690
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,740
 "What are you talking about?

691
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,060
 "This is crazy."

692
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,620
 I said, "Oh, you talked to my friend."

693
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,380
 "No, I didn't talk to anybody."

694
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,460
 I said, "I was praying about who would do this,

695
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,780
 "and I feel like the Lord's leading me to you."

696
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,100
 I'm like, "What?"

697
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,380
 So I went to an interview.

698
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,580
 They said, "Why should we hire you?"

699
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,260
 I was like, "You'd be crazy to hire me.

700
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,820
 "Don't do that.

701
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,100
 "That's not gonna be good for anybody.

702
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,000
 "I'm gonna be broke,

703
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,560
 "and you guys are gonna have a pastor

704
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,400
 "that's not any good.

705
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,620
 "You know, don't do that."

706
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,420
 And they were like, "Yeah, you might be right.

707
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,100
 "Let us think about it."

708
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,740
 They took a week to think about it.

709
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,700
 You know what happened?

710
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,660
 A company in St. Louis called, said,

711
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,500
 "Hey, come up here.

712
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,660
 "We wanna interview you."

713
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,060
 I went up there to interview, and they said,

714
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,640
 "Hey, we want you to build a sales organization

715
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,480
 "for us in Dallas.

716
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,000
 "You can work out of your house.

717
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,300
 "You're gonna be making twice as much

718
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,320
 "as what you're making right now.

719
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,980
 "It's gonna be amazing.

720
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,220
 "By the way, we wanna offer you the job right now."

721
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,660
 It was like my dream job.

722
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,260
 I got on a Southwest flight back from St. Louis to Dallas,

723
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,520
 and you know what I did?

724
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,740
 Watermark called, said, "Hey, we want to offer you the job.

725
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,020
 "We got two jobs."

726
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
 You know what I did?

727
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:55,580
 I said, "Man, I think I gotta go do this other thing,

728
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,860
 "the sales job."

729
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,500
 Turned it down.

730
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,500
 After I had said I'd been called to ministry,

731
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,900
 God was so big, right?

732
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,740
 You know what I mean?

733
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,300
 Five days later, it was a miracle.

734
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,360
 It was a miracle.

735
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,900
 The Lord provided, He did everything, He was so faithful.

736
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,100
 I said, "I think I gotta go make money, man.

737
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,900
 "I'll make some money, I'll save some money,

738
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,140
 "and then I'll do that ministry thing.

739
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,020
 "That's how this will work.

740
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,220
 "It'll be beautiful."

741
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,900
 I did that job for six months.

742
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,140
 Every single day I woke up,

743
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,140
 and I knew I was being disobedient.

744
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,700
 Every single day I woke up, I knew I was running

745
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,320
 from my calling, what God had clearly ordained.

746
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,380
 And on the day of my six-month anniversary,

747
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,160
 I went and told them, "Hey, I've gotta go do

748
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,260
 "this ministry thing."

749
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,860
 "I've gotta go do that."

750
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,180
 And you would think that'd be the end

751
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,380
 of this beautiful story, but every single day,

752
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,020
 my heart wants comfort.

753
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,860
 Every day, my heart wants control.

754
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,620
 Even in the midst of seeing God do miracles

755
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,740
 and change the lives of young adults,

756
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,540
 and to see a revival right before my eyes,

757
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,580
 a great awakening through 20 and 30-somethings,

758
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:08,580
 and every day, I'm tempted by the world to run from God.

759
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,460
 And you hear, "Well, how does that relate to me?

760
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,560
 "Because God, He's not calling you to ministry.

761
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,420
 "Can I tell you something?"

762
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,380
 God is calling you to ministry.

763
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,980
 He's calling you to ministry.

764
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,740
 You look and audit the last eight hours of your life,

765
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
 and can I tell you something?

766
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,460
 If you didn't do ministry, you missed your calling.

767
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:31,820
 If you didn't do ministry, today, as you look backwards,

768
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,780
 you missed out on your purpose.

769
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,580
 What, you thought God put you here just to make money?

770
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,580
 Just to be comfortable?

771
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,700
 That's why you think God left you here?

772
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,980
 So that you could be as comfortable as possible

773
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,820
 and then die?

774
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,780
 That's why you think He left you here?

775
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,180
 No, He called you to Himself to be a part

776
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,700
 of the greatest mission that has ever existed.

777
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,540
 What are you gonna do with your life?

778
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,780
 You're gonna live the American dream

779
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,380
 and then die the American dream?

780
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:08,020
 And have no eternal significance whatsoever?

781
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,200
 That's it?

782
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,920
 You've been called to ministry.

783
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,640
 In the same way that I was called to ministry

784
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,220
 long before working for a church.

785
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,160
 Could you imagine if we have a good job,

786
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,780
 a nice house, success, great friends,

787
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,640
 minimal pain, and nothing in heaven?

788
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,220
 It's like Francis Chan said,

789
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,460
 "Our greatest fear should not be a failure,

790
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,800
 "but of succeeding at things in life

791
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,100
 "that don't really matter."

792
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,860
 Let me say it again.

793
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,640
 "Our greatest fear should not be a failure,

794
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,380
 "but of succeeding at things in life

795
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,780
 "that don't really matter."

796
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:53,660
 So,

797
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:00,500
 if the temptation for you is to be more comfortable,

798
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,580
 wouldn't the most loving thing God could do

799
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,880
 is start to remove some of that protection?

800
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:14,460
 So that you don't make protection your God,

801
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,320
 so that you don't make comfort your God.

802
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,420
 See, sometimes God removes our protection

803
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,620
 for our own protection.

804
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,200
 Sometimes God kills the leafy plant covering our head

805
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,260
 from the hot sun for our own protection.

806
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,220
 Sometimes God removes our protection

807
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,260
 for our own protection.

808
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,980
 Can I tell you something really interesting here?

809
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,560
 Is the word God provides,

810
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,660
 it's the word manna with the H at the end of it.

811
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,320
 It's where we get the word manna,

812
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,340
 where in Exodus 16, God provides food out of heaven,

813
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,600
 like food from nowhere.

814
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,300
 Manna is what that's called.

815
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,220
 God provides manna.

816
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,680
 And so this word God provides,

817
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,420
 it shows up in this book over and over and over.

818
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,840
 God provided a whale or a big fish.

819
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,160
 God provided a plant.

820
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,600
 Then he provided a worm.

821
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,260
 And then he provided a scorching east wind.

822
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,660
 Sometimes God removes our protection

823
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,720
 for our own protection.

824
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,740
 So we don't make a God out of comfort.

825
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,800
 We're Christ followers, right?

826
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,780
 Jesus followers.

827
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,860
 We're to emulate Christ, to be like Christ.

828
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,700
 Can I tell you something?

829
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,280
 Did Christ pursue comfort when he was here?

830
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,540
 You remember in Matthew 16, where he's talking to his boys,

831
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,380
 he's got them huddled up.

832
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,940
 He said, "Man, you guys know what's gonna happen to me

833
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,160
 "is I'm gonna go to Jerusalem,

834
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,360
 "and they're gonna spit on me and curse me

835
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,560
 "and torture me and then publicly kill me."

836
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,820
 And Peter's there and he's like,

837
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,080
 "No, no, no, no, no, Jesus.

838
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,900
 "That's not going to happen."

839
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,420
 And he turns to Peter and he says,

840
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,960
 "Get behind me, Satan.

841
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,060
 "You are a stumbling block to me.

842
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,840
 "You do not have in mind the concerns of God,"

843
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,480
 underline concerns, "but merely human concerns.

844
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,140
 "You're just thinking about your own comfort, Peter.

845
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,640
 "I didn't put you here to be comfortable, Peter."

846
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,280
 Then Jesus said to his disciples,

847
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,040
 "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves

848
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,780
 "and take up their cross and follow me,

849
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,960
 "for whoever wants to save their life will lose it,

850
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,880
 "but whoever loses their life for me will find it."

851
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,540
 What good will it be for you,

852
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,620
 porch goers,

853
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,760
 to gain the whole world and yet forfeit your soul?

854
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,520
 And what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?

855
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:20,240
 The Christian life is not one of comfort, but of commission.

856
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,200
 The Christian life is not one of comfort,

857
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,200
 but of commission, that's you being on mission with God,

858
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,460
 living out your purpose, living out your calling.

859
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,160
 You're not too cool for that, man.

860
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,800
 Okay, you've got to get past yourself

861
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,280
 and your fears and your insecurities,

862
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,160
 and you've got to start surrendering.

863
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,640
 Lord, I can't, but you can.

864
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,760
 I know I'm so afraid to even mention the word Jesus,

865
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,320
 but God, would you embolden me and give me courage,

866
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,300
 'cause I know you didn't give me a spirit of timidity.

867
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,540
 What a power of love and self-discipline.

868
00:34:53,540 --> 00:35:01,340
 If God calls you to something uncomfortable,

869
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,680
 are you willing to go?

870
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,240
 Jesus gave up his comfort for you and I,

871
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,360
 so that we would live for him.

872
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,660
 Verse 10, "But the Lord said,

873
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,380
 "you have been concerned about this plant,

874
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,760
 "though you did not tend to it or make it grow.

875
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,800
 "It sprang up overnight and died overnight.

876
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,360
 "And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh

877
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,880
 "in which there are more than 120,000 people

878
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,360
 "who cannot tell their right hand from their left,

879
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,280
 "and so many animals?"

880
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,100
 Question mark, end of book.

881
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,320
 Walk off the stage, done.

882
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,240
 Are you serious?

883
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,480
 Is that not the craziest chapter in all of the Bible?

884
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,040
 Like that's how that book just ended.

885
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,300
 Let me break it down for you.

886
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,300
 He says, he says, "You're so afraid of it,

887
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,660
 "I mean, you're so concerned about this plant,

888
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,460
 "but you didn't even make the plant.

889
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,360
 "You didn't even tend to the plant.

890
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,720
 "You didn't even care for the plant.

891
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,480
 "You don't even have a green thumb.

892
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,940
 "But the Ninevites I made, all 600,000 of them,

893
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,420
 "and 120,000 children,

894
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,460
 "those who don't know their right from their left,

895
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,220
 "120,000 children, and even the animals there I made.

896
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,140
 "Since you don't care about the Ninevites,

897
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,440
 "do you care about their kids, Jonah?

898
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,900
 "Do you care about their kids, Jonah?

899
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,440
 "How about their animals, Jonah?

900
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,260
 "If you don't care about them, do you care about their kids?

901
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,500
 "Do you care about their golden doodles, Jonah?"

902
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,220
 God's punking him, man, like in a righteous, holy way.

903
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,120
 Somehow he's like, "What about the animals, Jonah?

904
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,560
 "Do you even care about them?

905
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,220
 "You didn't make that plant.

906
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,080
 "You care about your succulent more than your neighbor.

907
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:58,380
 "You care about your ficus tree more than your coworker,

908
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:05,180
 "and they're both dying."

909
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,580
 And they're both dying.

910
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,640
 Some of us, we care about our bicycle, or our vehicle,

911
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,640
 or our watch, or a purse, or a bag, or a retirement plan

912
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,000
 more than our neighbors.

913
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,120
 We check our bank accounts more often

914
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,360
 than we share the gospel.

915
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,000
 What's wrong with us?

916
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,760
 The rebellious heart of a runaway has misguided concerns.

917
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,580
 That's my third point.

918
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,280
 The rebellious heart of a runaway has misguided concerns.

919
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,460
 "Jonah, if you're concerned about the plant,

920
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,840
 "should I not be concerned about these people

921
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,520
 "whom I've created?"

922
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,280
 See, you have misguided concerns

923
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,440
 because your concerns are driven by your desire to control

924
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,160
 and your desire for comfort.

925
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,920
 Your desire for control and comfort

926
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,600
 has misguided your concerns.

927
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,300
 And it's not just of non-believers.

928
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,560
 Even Christians can drift to this place.

929
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,940
 Even younger brothers become older brothers.

930
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,080
 All of a sudden, you fall in love with Jesus.

931
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,880
 You wanna share the gospel with everyone.

932
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,920
 You start reading your Bible, and by the world,

933
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,840
 you're beat down to lukewarm Christianity,

934
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,660
 which may not even be Christianity.

935
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,200
 So tired.

936
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,040
 That's because you're doing stuff by your strength,

937
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,000
 not God's strength.

938
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,840
 God uses the weak to shame the strong.

939
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,040
 You're tired because you're so wrapped up

940
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,160
 in the current of the world,

941
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,260
 you weren't meant to swim in that current.

942
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,740
 You start standing against that current

943
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,420
 by the power of the Lord,

944
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,520
 with the power of His Holy Spirit.

945
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,160
 And I don't think you're gonna be so tired.

946
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,000
 Even a Christian can drift to this place.

947
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,360
 I would say it's natural for a Christian

948
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,760
 to drift to this place, not surrendered, but to God,

949
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,240
 not surrendered to His Spirit.

950
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,040
 And be careful, because what's gonna happen

951
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,400
 is you're gonna gain the whole world,

952
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,720
 and yet forfeit your soul.

953
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,240
 So here's a question for you.

954
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,360
 Do you care that people are going to hell?

955
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,160
 I mean, do you really believe that people are going to hell?

956
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,360
 And if you really believe that people are going to hell,

957
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,400
 where would you go and not share the gospel?

958
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,760
 On the day of my anniversary, my marriage to Monica,

959
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,000
 which is the 25th of every month,

960
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,620
 I buy her some hydrangeas.

961
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,800
 She likes hydrangeas.

962
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,700
 And so worked it out with a local florist

963
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,240
 that on the 25th of every month,

964
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,680
 she gets some fresh hydrangeas.

965
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,380
 Do you know why I have to buy them for her every month?

966
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,720
 Because they die.

967
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,320
 They last about two weeks, and then they die.

968
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,720
 And they're tossed out.

969
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,280
 And this is a metaphor that the Scriptures give us.

970
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,240
 Wheat and the tares, the grass thrown out, threshing floor,

971
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,640
 that we are all dying, that we're going to face judgment,

972
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,960
 that every person you bump into,

973
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,560
 every person you talk to is a soul on this earth

974
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,800
 dying, headed towards judgment.

975
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,760
 So like Jonah's plant died, so will the Ninevites,

976
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,080
 so will your neighbors, so will your coworkers.

977
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,020
 And so if God is cared, you know who God loves?

978
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,440
 Every person God created.

979
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,920
 I just think about how much I love my kids

980
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,040
 and the really small role I played in their creation,

981
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
 really tiny role.

982
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,800
 And God, He ordained your days ahead of creation

983
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,240
 so that you might walk in Him,

984
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,800
 in the works that He desires to do through you.

985
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,560
 He's crazy about you.

986
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,200
 He's not mad at you.

987
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,200
 He loves you, and He really wants you to surrender to Him

988
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,160
 so that you might live out your purpose for the first time.

989
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,480
 He has such incredible plans for you,

990
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,480
 but you're so distracted by your sin,

991
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,360
 and you're so distracted by the world,

992
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,280
 and you're so distracted by your own agenda

993
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,600
 that you can't see God's agenda.

994
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:23,000
 And there's freedom in life

995
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,360
 when you care for what God cares about.

996
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,520
 It's really the essence of having the heart of God.

997
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,360
 So why did this crazy book happen?

998
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,720
 Why is it in the Scripture?

999
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,640
 Why did God preserve these four chapters

1000
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,440
 that we would teach in here tonight?

1001
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,480
 To teach us about Jesus.

1002
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,440
 He did this to teach us about Jesus.

1003
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,340
 See, Jesus trusted the Father.

1004
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,640
 This weekend, it's Easter.

1005
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,280
 It's a layup opportunity for you to invite someone to church

1006
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,760
 and to talk about the gospel.

1007
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,200
 People are really willing to listen

1008
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,320
 to the gospel this time

1009
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,160
 because it explains the holiday

1010
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,320
 that we're about to celebrate.

1011
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,160
 You can test me.

1012
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,280
 If somebody gets angry at you

1013
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,680
 for talking about the gospel, come find me.

1014
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,640
 I'd love to hear about it,

1015
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,920
 but I'm telling you, you can take a risk tomorrow.

1016
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,320
 You should every day, but specifically this week,

1017
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,360
 you can talk to someone about Easter, and you should.

1018
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,400
 And some of you are like,

1019
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
 you know, I wouldn't have the rebellious heart of a runaway

1020
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,200
 if I just had a sign from God.

1021
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,240
 You're like talking about JP, like, God talked to you.

1022
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,400
 Like, if God would just do that to me, I'd follow him.

1023
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,240
 I'd give him my heart.

1024
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,700
 If he just gave me a sign, he did.

1025
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,960
 It was an empty tomb.

1026
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,200
 Find me the bones of Jesus.

1027
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,320
 He gave you a sign.

1028
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,400
 This man from a town you wouldn't know about

1029
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,920
 except he was born there, Bethlehem,

1030
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,080
 lived in a town, Nazareth.

1031
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,560
 You wouldn't even know where it is on a map

1032
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,440
 except he lived there,

1033
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,700
 became the single most polarizing character in history

1034
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,160
 that on his birthdate, every atheist friend you have

1035
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,000
 signs the date of his birthdate on their checks,

1036
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,320
 or they count from it anyways.

1037
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,800
 2018 years from the day he was born,

1038
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,400
 he reset time, this guy.

1039
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,080
 And the empty tomb is the sign that you need.

1040
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,520
 'Cause you're like, if he was real,

1041
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,480
 if he'd give me a sign,

1042
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,680
 I wouldn't have the heart of a runaway.

1043
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,160
 He has, it's Matthew chapter 12, verse 38.

1044
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,060
 "Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law said to Jesus,

1045
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,500
 "'Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.'

1046
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,780
 "He answered, 'A wicked and adulterous generation

1047
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,140
 "'asks for a sign, but none will be given

1048
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,500
 "'except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

1049
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,620
 "'For as Jonah was three days and three nights

1050
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,860
 "'in the belly of a huge fish,

1051
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,200
 "'so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights

1052
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,540
 "'in the heart of the earth.

1053
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,520
 "'The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment

1054
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,920
 "'with this generation and condemn it,

1055
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,960
 "'for they repented at the preaching of Jonah,

1056
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,440
 "'and now something greater than Jonah is here.'"

1057
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,440
 The Ninevites, those wicked people,

1058
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,440
 will stand as we face judgment.

1059
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,800
 And those of us who have not trusted in Christ

1060
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,600
 will be way, way, way infinitely worse off than they are.

1061
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,600
 Guys, can I tell you why this story's in there?

1062
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,160
 Think about this, if you know the Bible at all,

1063
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,320
 I don't know if you know in Mark chapter four,

1064
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,320
 when the storm comes and Jesus is there with his disciples

1065
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,280
 and Jesus is sleeping and they come to him,

1066
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,320
 they say, "How could you be sleeping at a time like this?"

1067
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,360
 And they're like, "Hey, you gotta stop this storm."

1068
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,180
 Well, I don't know if you remember in Jonah chapter one,

1069
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,880
 there's a boat and a storm and Jonah's sleeping.

1070
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,760
 And you know what they said is the same phrase.

1071
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,440
 How could you be sleeping at a time like this?

1072
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,960
 We gotta stop the storm.

1073
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,840
 The way that Jesus stopped it is he said, "Stop."

1074
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,500
 The way that Jonah stopped it, he's like,

1075
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,080
 "Man, you gotta sacrifice me to the sea."

1076
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,380
 See, Jonah was a sinner who ran from God.

1077
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,920
 Listen, Jonah was a sinner who ran from God.

1078
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,580
 Jesus is the God who runs towards sinners.

1079
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,640
 Jonah was thrown overboard as a sacrifice for his sin.

1080
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,820
 Jesus was sacrificed for our sin.

1081
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,840
 Jonah was resurrected from the depth after three days.

1082
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,880
 Jesus was resurrected from the grave after three days.

1083
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,380
 Jonah brought a message of condemnation.

1084
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,640
 Jesus brought a message of reconciliation.

1085
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,880
 It's John chapter three.

1086
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,920
 "For God did not send his Son into the world

1087
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,840
 "to condemn the world, but to save the world through him."

1088
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,000
 Jonah didn't wanna see one nation bow their knee to God.

1089
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,240
 Jesus is the God to whom every nation and knee will bow.

1090
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,960
 Jonah spent 40 days hoping for destruction on a city.

1091
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,920
 Jesus spent 40 days after his resurrection

1092
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,920
 ministering so that we would not be destroyed.

1093
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,680
 Jonah waited for his enemies to be punished.

1094
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,200
 Jesus was punished for his enemies.

1095
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,920
 Jonah had a heart of anger.

1096
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,640
 Jesus has a heart of love.

1097
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,280
 Jonah needed a savior.

1098
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,760
 Jesus is Jonah's savior.

1099
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,840
 Jesus is the greater Jonah.

1100
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,120
 Jesus is the greater Jonah.

1101
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,240
 Jesus has everything under control.

1102
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,800
 He's got the whole world in his hands.

1103
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,080
 He's got the whole world in his hands.

1104
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,860
 Jesus sacrificed his comfort to give us eternity.

1105
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,700
 And Jesus' greatest concern is saving you

1106
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,140
 and helping you live out your real calling.

1107
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,080
 What Jesus did that Jonah didn't

1108
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,760
 is Jesus trusted the Father.

1109
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,200
 Jesus did the will of the Father.

1110
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,400
 Friends, can I tell you, there is not any life

1111
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,800
 that you will live as magnificent and wonderful

1112
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,920
 and fantastic and incredible as you every day

1113
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,160
 waking up and trusting the Father.

1114
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,980
 That is the adventure, man.

1115
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,200
 That is your purpose.

1116
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,500
 That is your calling.

1117
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:37,400
 Last week was my daughter's spring break,

1118
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,160
 and so we went to a friend's lake house,

1119
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,040
 and God gave us this beautiful day out there.

1120
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,000
 It was perfect weather, bright, sunny sky, clear skies.

1121
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,400
 And we sat out on the deck,

1122
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,880
 and I was fishing with two of my kids,

1123
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,800
 and my daughter, Presley, wanted to go on a paddleboard.

1124
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,240
 And so she gets on the paddleboard,

1125
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,840
 and she's paddling out there,

1126
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,160
 and I'm like, yeah, have fun, have fun.

1127
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,800
 It's a beautiful day, have fun.

1128
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,360
 And I'm fishing with the other two,

1129
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,520
 and I'm watching her because when one of my kids

1130
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,080
 is not right there with me and in potential danger,

1131
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,120
 I'm watching, every move, I'm fishing,

1132
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,840
 but I'm watching her, I'm watching, I see you, Presley.

1133
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,840
 And she goes out a little further and a little further,

1134
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,760
 and she's almost to the middle of the lake now,

1135
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,200
 like just a speck on the horizon.

1136
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,160
 But I'm watching her, and I can see, you know,

1137
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,800
 boats are going by and whatnot, and I'm watching her.

1138
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,560
 And she keeps, I'm thinking she's gonna come back

1139
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,520
 right about now, but then I notice

1140
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,000
 there's a strong crosswind on the lake.

1141
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,240
 And she keeps drifting further and further and further.

1142
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,120
 And right about now, a loving father,

1143
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,760
 I'm like, okay, I don't have a boat, you know?

1144
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,800
 And so I'm like, somebody, I gotta find a boat,

1145
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,480
 you know, anybody got a boat?

1146
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,240
 And so I finally flagged down someone with a boat,

1147
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,720
 and I'm like, hey, can you take me to get my daughter

1148
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,660
 on the other side of the lake?

1149
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,660
 Now she has reached the other shore.

1150
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,500
 I'm serious, all the way across the lake,

1151
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,960
 she's climbed out on the other shore.

1152
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,880
 Can you take me to get her, to bring her back?

1153
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,960
 He says, sure, the whole family gets in his boat,

1154
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,360
 and this nice stranger, you know,

1155
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,680
 takes us across the lake there,

1156
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,320
 it's a really large cove, takes us across the lake,

1157
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,880
 and we get there, and the kids, you know,

1158
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,800
 her sister and brother are like,

1159
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,320
 were you scared, were you scared?

1160
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,000
 She's like, no, I wasn't scared,

1161
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,440
 I knew Daddy was watching me.

1162
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,440
 I wasn't scared.

1163
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,360
 I wasn't scared.

1164
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,480
 And they said, what were you thinking?

1165
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,880
 Like, when you were out there in the middle,

1166
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,720
 were you concerned?

1167
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,040
 She said, no, I wasn't concerned,

1168
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,120
 I was watching Daddy to see if he was concerned,

1169
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,200
 'cause if he's not concerned, then I'm not concerned,

1170
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,880
 I know he's watching me.

1171
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,880
 I was like, oh, you must not have seen my concern,

1172
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,320
 you know? (laughing)

1173
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,440
 Were you scared?

1174
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,760
 No, I knew Daddy would come get me.

1175
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,000
 I knew he'd come for me.

1176
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,920
 I wasn't scared.

1177
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,320
 And what a beautiful picture of faith,

1178
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,400
 which she didn't know, 'cause her daddy can hardly swim,

1179
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,520
 you know, he's not even very,

1180
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,200
 you know, I'm like, I need a boat.

1181
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,120
 But God, man, he's watching.

1182
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,120
 You've never been anywhere, he's not watching you, man.

1183
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,880
 Some of you, that's your biggest fear, right?

1184
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,720
 He's watching.

1185
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,720
 He sees you.

1186
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,800
 I want you to take a deep breath.

1187
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,520
 Breathe in, exhale, do it again now, okay, ready?

1188
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,440
 Take a deep breath.

1189
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,400
 Exhale.

1190
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,120
 He's watching.

1191
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,240
 He's got you.

1192
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,720
 He's got a plan for your life, it's beautiful.

1193
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,080
 You're never gonna regret risking anything for him.

1194
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,280
 You can't even use the word risk,

1195
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,960
 it's not a risk when it's for God.

1196
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,960
 That you live out his purpose.

1197
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,400
 You don't have to be concerned,

1198
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,040
 you don't have to be afraid.

1199
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,240
 You know what you can do?

1200
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,560
 It's just like Presley said,

1201
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,760
 you can live the adventure that he has you on.

1202
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,280
 Not the stupid one in South Padre,

1203
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,680
 but the one in your place of business,

1204
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,120
 the one in your communities,

1205
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,040
 the one overseas maybe.

1206
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,680
 Some of you, you might move overseas,

1207
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,560
 I don't know what he has, but it's gonna be amazing.

1208
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,440
 And you can trust him, friends.

1209
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,760
 He loves you, he is a gracious God,

1210
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,720
 compassionate, slow to anger.

1211
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,920
 Isn't that good news?

1212
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,000
 He's slow to anger, he's slow to anger.

1213
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,360
 And abounding in love.

1214
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,120
 He's got enough for you.

1215
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:46,640
 So this story here, it's to teach us about him.

1216
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,840
 See, when I was in Padre, we ran to Mexico,

1217
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,200
 I was afraid to get caught.

1218
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,320
 What I've learned since then,

1219
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,960
 what I've learned since then,

1220
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,000
 is the most amazing thing that ever happened to me

1221
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,600
 is I got caught.

1222
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,080
 God caught me with his grace.

1223
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,360
 Changed my life forever.

1224
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,960
 Gave me purpose, a mission, a calling, direction.

1225
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,440
 A new reason to live.

1226
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,720
 Jonah kept wanting to die,

1227
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,620
 I have a new reason to live in Christ.

1228
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,400
 That's my prayer for you.

1229
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,320
 That's my prayer for you, I'm gonna pray right now.

1230
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,920
 Father, would you give my friends a new reason to live?

1231
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,920
 Would you show them their purpose in Christ?

1232
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,760
 Father, I pray for friends listening

1233
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,280
 wherever they're at right now.

1234
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:43,200
 You are the God of the storm.

1235
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,400
 The fish obeyed you.

1236
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,880
 The Ninevites obeyed you.

1237
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,880
 The plant obeyed you.

1238
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,880
 The worm obeyed you.

1239
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,920
 The sun obeyed you.

1240
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,960
 The wind obeyed you.

1241
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,960
 And God, Jonah obeyed you eventually with the wrong heart.

1242
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,760
 And we don't wanna walk in obedience with the wrong heart.

1243
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,600
 God, would you protect us from that?

1244
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,360
 And Lord, we know that sometimes you remove our protection

1245
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,560
 for our own protection,

1246
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,640
 so that we might turn to you for protection.

1247
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,720
 God, would you help us to do that right now?

1248
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,920
 Would you increase our faith?

1249
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,480
 As we sing this song, would you align our hearts

1250
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,200
 as we move towards Easter,

1251
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,560
 and not just a dead God on a cross, but an empty tomb?

1252
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,280
 A payment for our sins,

1253
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,800
 so that we don't have to pay for our sins.

1254
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:48,760
 Father, would you stir our hearts for you?

1255
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,640
 That every young adult listening right now

1256
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:57,680
 would leave here or leave their place loving you more.

1257
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,240
 Would you do that even now?

1258
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,600
 In Christ's name, amen.

1259
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:11,600
