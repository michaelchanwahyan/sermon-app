[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   (drum roll)
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.580]   - We need to all pray for Eminem's salvation.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.500]   How awesome would that be?
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.600]   To do as a believer, sick.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.100]   In 2009, Chris Brown faced felony charges.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.960]   The reason he did is he was at the very height of his career.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.760]   It was the night before the Grammys.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.520]   He's on a date, or out with his girlfriend
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.700]   but he's also at the height of her career.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.060]   In fact, Ryan Seacrest said she may be the greatest artist
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.000]   that ever lived, said that about her at this time.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.800]   She was, of course, Rihanna.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.800]   They were in a rented Lamborghini in Beverly Hills
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.640]   and they got in a fight.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.360]   She threw his keys out the window
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.240]   and he began to choke her, as one witness said.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.240]   And then he began to beat her
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.840]   until she was nearly unconscious,
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.380]   which sent this picture viral over the internet.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.640]   This is a picture of Rihanna after her fight
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.840]   with her boyfriend, Chris Brown.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.180]   The reason that he faced felony charges.
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.920]   And what's crazy about that,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.680]   some of you may have known that story.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.180]   It happened a little while ago.
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.600]   What was insane about that to me
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.520]   was not just the fact that he beat her up,
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.360]   it was the fact that she then went back
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.120]   into a relationship with him after that.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.360]   I remember watching the news and reading the articles
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.220]   and I was like, what?
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.700]   How could she get back with that monster?
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.200]   How could she get back with someone
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.740]   who would do that to her?
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.400]   Now, every sense of logic, as you watch on,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.480]   would say, wait a minute, no, no, no, no,
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.260]   he abused you, don't go back to him.
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.380]   That's what logic would say,
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.180]   but then emotions would say, but I love him.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.760]   And we would say, Rihanna, you're crazy, except for,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.640]   we do the same thing.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.140]   Logic, logic, unbiased parties would say,
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.120]   no, no, that's not, no, you shouldn't,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.200]   you shouldn't poison yourself until you throw up.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.800]   But emotions say, but I like having a good time.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.060]   You ever been somewhere, you ever been hugging a toilet?
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.400]   I'll be like, I'll never drink again.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.200]   Evidently you have.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.120]   And then you do, right?
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.720]   Or ever been in a relationship,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.680]   or maybe it's like logic says,
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.680]   I shouldn't have sex with a picture of a girl
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.600]   I don't know by myself.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.040]   But emotions say, man, I need that release.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.440]   I wanna seek that pleasure.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.520]   There's something broken inside of us.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.320]   We look at Rihanna and we're like,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.480]   how could you pursue that which is going to hurt you?
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.320]   And then we look at our lives and we're like,
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.820]   oh, wait a minute.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.480]   Why do I do the same thing?
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.240]   Why do I do what I don't wanna do?
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.120]   The good I wanna do, I don't do.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.160]   No, it's the evil I don't wanna do.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.800]   This I keep on doing.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.600]   It's a little verse David covered a couple weeks ago
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.960]   when we talked about being a Christian hypocrite.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.680]   Paul says it like this.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.840]   For I do not do the good I wanna do,
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.880]   but the evil I do not wanna do.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.800]   This I keep on doing.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.440]   One republic in a song called Counting Stars
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.520]   and it goes this way.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.680]   I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.600]   So let me ask you a question.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.080]   What do you do that you don't wanna do?
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.000]   What are you doing in the season that you don't want to?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.600]   What is that thing in your life that you're like,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.440]   man, I just don't wanna do?
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.400]   I want you to think about that for a second.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.240]   What is it for you?
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.680]   What is the thing for you?
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.760]   Is it a relationship?
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.280]   Is it spending?
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.120]   Is it sex?
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.280]   Is it porn?
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.400]   Is it drinking?
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.640]   Is it partying?
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.880]   What do you do that you don't wanna do?
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:12.960]   Is it a sense of jealousy?
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.960]   Man, jealousy's so dark.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.480]   I don't like her 'cause she's pretty.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.980]   How gross is that?
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.240]   How dark is that?
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.080]   I don't like her 'cause she's with him
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.680]   and he was mine but he wasn't really mine.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.880]   I mean, I've never even talked to him,
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.640]   but I don't like her.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.800]   When someone fails, you celebrate it.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.880]   How dark is that?
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.200]   Like in your heart, not publicly,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.120]   but in your heart, you're entertained by their failure.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.800]   Or is it greed or materialism?
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.080]   You're like, man, maybe if I just buy this one more thing,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.920]   it's gonna fill the void in my heart
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.240]   even though my closet full of purses
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.600]   and my closet full of jeans,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.320]   my last car, my last apartment,
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.160]   it didn't fill that void.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.880]   Maybe it's sex for you.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.760]   Maybe you believe the lie one last time
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.120]   which actually feeds the monster
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.640]   so that that last time won't be that last time
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.440]   because that's the lie you keep on believing.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.840]   One last time, I'm gonna look at that image.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.560]   I'm gonna do that one last time.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.520]   One more time at 2 a.m. by myself in bed.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.920]   I'll do it one more time.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.760]   Last time.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.600]   I'll go back to him one more time.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.360]   Is it discontentment,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.200]   just wanting badly to be in another season?
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.840]   I'm just not, I just can't rely.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.840]   I'm just not content.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.120]   I just, I don't like my body.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.120]   I'm discontent with my body.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.240]   I'm discontent with the way God made me.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.240]   I'm just not happy with it.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.280]   I want something else.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.440]   Is it anxiety?
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.760]   I say that I believe in God.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.920]   I say that I'm saved by grace through faith,
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.000]   trusting God,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.880]   but I can't really trust God
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.040]   because I'm marked by anxiety.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.200]   I'm afraid that he's gonna give me what is not good.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.520]   (congregation mumbling)
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.480]   Is it just loving the party?
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.200]   Weekend warrior, man, can't wait 'til Friday.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.040]   Just can't wait.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.880]   Go back out there.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.240]   It's when I feel alive in the club, JP, in the bar.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.920]   That's when I'm alive, running up that bar tab.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.760]   That's what it is.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.240]   Or maybe it's not just drinking.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.400]   Maybe it's getting high for you or whatever that is.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   Love not feeling normal.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.840]   Maybe it's returning to old relationships like Rihanna.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.320]   Going back to that, what you know was not God honoring,
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.640]   and you think, well, maybe this time it is.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.480]   Maybe he changed.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.320]   Maybe she changed.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.720]   Maybe she's different.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.000]   What are you doing that you don't wanna do?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.240]   And the question that I seek to answer tonight is why?
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.160]   From the scripture.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.840]   See, the monster that Rihanna felt victim to
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.260]   is not Chris Brown.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.400]   The monster that Rihanna felt victim to
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.240]   was, she appropriately says today, within her.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.520]   It was something within her that she followed,
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.720]   and it's the same monster you and I follow today.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.760]   It's the same monster Paul regrets following
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.560]   thousands of years ago.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.360]   It's the same monster that has marked humanity
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.440]   since the garden, and it's not Satan.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.800]   It's something within us, and so today we're talking
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.280]   about the monster that kills from within.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.440]   As we move through a series called Lyrics and Lies,
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.320]   we're looking at the message that music that we listen to
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.720]   tells us what is the truth from that message,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.200]   what is the lie from that message,
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.040]   and what is the theological truth that we can pursue
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.800]   in the scriptures, in God's words,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.920]   around the message that that song kinda touches on.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.680]   And so the song today is The Monster by Eminem
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.600]   featuring Rihanna, where she just says,
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.080]   I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.360]   Get along with the voices inside of my head.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.680]   You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.960]   and you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.240]   And so what I hope to do this evening is,
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.080]   one, I wanna define the monster.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.800]   What is this monster that Rihanna's singing about?
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.160]   And two, I hope to define how we can be saved
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.440]   from this monster through the scriptures.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.080]   Why is it that we've trusted in Christ,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.040]   but we keep on sinning, and then before we leave here
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.960]   this evening, how do we kill the monster?
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.160]   How do we put to death the monster?
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.920]   How do we stop doing that which we don't wanna do?
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.400]   I'll be in Romans 7 and 8, as Shane said,
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.440]   to set this up, Romans was written in around 57 AD.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.280]   It was written to new Gentile and Jewish believers
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.280]   in the city of Rome.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.000]   They were gathering their new in their faith,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.760]   and they have all these questions that Paul,
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.720]   the apostle Paul, is trying to answer.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.040]   Like, why do I sin?
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.280]   And like, if Christ saved me from sin,
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.080]   what does it look like that Christ saved me from sin,
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.960]   but I keep on sinning?
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.440]   I mean, I'm supposed to be a new creation,
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.920]   but I don't really feel like a new creation
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.360]   'cause I'm falling into the same things
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.240]   that I did before I was a new creation.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.840]   That feels like an old creation.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.160]   And so they have these questions,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.440]   and Paul's attempting to answer these questions
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.560]   through some very theological-heavy texts,
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   Romans 7 and 8.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.440]   And so we'll start right after that scripture
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.440]   that David touched on.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.160]   He says this in verse 20, in 7, verse 20.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.240]   Now, if I do what I do not wanna do,
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.080]   it is no longer I who do it,
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.240]   but it is the sin living in me that does it.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.280]   Underline that, sin living in me that does it.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.440]   So I find this law at work,
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.480]   and when you see law there, it's a principle.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.200]   So I see this principle at work.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.640]   Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.720]   For in my inner being, I delight in God's law,
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.000]   God's rules, God's instructions.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.160]   But I see another principle at work in me,
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.080]   waging war against the law of my mind.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.640]   Rihanna says, I get along with the voices inside my head.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.360]   Paul says, hey, there's a war waging in my mind
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.000]   and making me a prisoner of the law of sin
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.440]   at work within me.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.400]   Again, underline within me.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.200]   And so my first question this evening is,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.840]   who is the monster?
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.880]   And verse 20 and verse 22 says,
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.720]   it is the sin living in me.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.980]   Verse 22 says, the sin at work within me
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.400]   that I've become a prisoner to.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.680]   Okay, some other terms that you might have heard
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.160]   this labeled as your flesh.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.960]   That's just my flesh, man.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.280]   Your sinful nature.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.320]   I have a sinful nature.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.160]   Do I still have a sinful nature after Christ?
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.040]   You have a sinful nature.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.040]   There is a natural predisposition to humans to sin
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.760]   or original sin.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.000]   You have something in you that desires to seek
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.120]   that which is not good for you.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.720]   And so stop blaming Satan.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.520]   Satan plays a role, but it's not that role.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.840]   His job's not that hard.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.320]   It is your own natural desires that cause you to sin.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.520]   It says in the scripture over and over.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.040]   And everyone has had this monster inside of them.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.920]   Spurgeon says it like this,
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.160]   beware of no man more than of yourself.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.360]   We carry our worst enemies within us.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.320]   This has been in everyone since the garden.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.880]   Worst of all my foes, I fear the enemy within,
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.040]   John Wesley says, to men of faith from the past.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.800]   And so as you think, well no,
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.960]   but it's Satan that makes me sin.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.800]   No, no, no, no.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.500]   Satan only presents to you that which you already want.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.800]   Okay, let me, Satan and the world and your sinful nature,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.600]   these are three forces that work against you this evening.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   Okay, there's this desire within you that wants something.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.440]   There's the world that presents to you what you want
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.240]   and then Satan speaks lies to you.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.500]   Yeah, you can get away with it.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.800]   God says, God wants to rip you off.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.360]   God wants to withhold good for you.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.820]   That's why he says he doesn't want you in that relationship.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.080]   Is it really what God says?
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.760]   I would go ahead and get in that relationship.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.120]   Let me, it's confusing, so let me say it again.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.040]   You have a desire within.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   The world presents that desire to you
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.600]   and Satan says, yeah, go ahead.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.440]   But what causes you to sin?
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.740]   It is your desire, the desire within you.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.560]   James 1, verse 14 says, but each person is tempted
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.320]   when they are dragged away by their own evil desire
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.580]   and enticed.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.220]   And so Satan, he presents to us what we naturally want,
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.560]   be it sex or thrills or the party or pleasure.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.220]   But here's the problem.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.380]   A lot of those things are not bad things.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.720]   Sex, for example, it's not, like God invented sex.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.980]   I told you that over and over throughout the years.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.300]   Sex was God's idea.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.340]   He created the parts.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.940]   He made them work the way that they do.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.380]   It's his brilliant creation, his invention.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.500]   It's a good thing.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.300]   No one is more pro-sex than God,
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.100]   but he says, hey, there's a way to it.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.340]   And so you have this desire within you
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.920]   that you think, mistakenly, that that desire is for sex.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.980]   It's not.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.220]   It's for intimacy.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.980]   It's for real love.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.400]   It is to give yourself to someone.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.580]   But what happens is you start to pursue shortcuts.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.180]   You turn that act into just an act of pleasure.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.180]   And when you begin to pursue those shortcuts,
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.580]   all of the sudden, now listen, this is the important part,
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.500]   all of the sudden, you can no longer enjoy that thing
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.480]   that God gifted to us the way that he intended.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.100]   Listen, let me say it again.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.140]   There's sex as God intended in marriage
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.940]   between a man and a woman, committed to each other for life.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.400]   And we say, hey, I wanna experience that before that
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.520]   or in some other way.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.740]   So we start to experience that and pursue that.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.280]   We begin to feed that monster and that monster grows,
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.820]   and then all of the sudden, that's not available to us.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.840]   You know why?
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.040]   Because now we don't want love and intimacy.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.280]   We want sex.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.400]   We want pleasure.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.400]   We want release.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.380]   And that's different than love and intimacy.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.980]   In fact, we don't even know how to have love and intimacy
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.820]   because we've become addicted to the monster within
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.680]   that which is just sex.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.900]   Do you see that?
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.200]   God loves you.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.440]   He's not trying to withhold something from you.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.200]   He's trying to give you something greater,
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.680]   something better than what you think it is that you want.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.440]   And so you want sex.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.600]   The world says, hey, there's all kinds of sex.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.440]   You can have any kind of sex you want.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.140]   Satan says, yeah, you should have sex.
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.120]   But it all started with you want sex.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.940]   Now, maybe that's not what you want,
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.900]   and so insert your sin struggle, right?
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.880]   Maybe it's like, no, I don't want sex.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.380]   I want a purse.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.520]   Okay, I want Tory Burch, all right?
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.000]   And so you're like, I know what it is.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.120]   No, it matches my shoes.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.480]   It's gonna be awesome.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.880]   And this is gonna be the ultimate end all, be all.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.000]   I just want this.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.560]   And then all of a sudden you open your closet
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.440]   and you realize it's full of purses
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.380]   that didn't fill that void.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.240]   But this one Tory Burch, this is gonna be the deal.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.280]   This is gonna be the game changer.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.800]   And it won't be.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.480]   And you just feed that monster.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.960]   It's like, okay, it's the party.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.160]   Dude, I just love just kind of, man, just getting loose,
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.140]   just feeling relaxed.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.040]   Couple shots of Patron.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.400]   Then a couple shots of Patron don't do it anymore.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.360]   I need something out of a little Xanax.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.380]   Maybe a line or two.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.040]   I need something more.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.480]   I gotta fill that void more.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.080]   And you're chasing that thing.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.420]   And God says, no, man.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.860]   You have never felt the goodness
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.360]   of being in an intimate relationship with me.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.240]   It's greater than Coke.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.760]   It's greater than Patron.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.240]   It's greater than a couple tabs.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.840]   It's greater than anything you could pursue in the world.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.280]   I'm literally out of the world.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:13.040]   This is what he's telling us here.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.960]   But once you partake your desires for that perversion grows
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.300]   and you feed that perversion and the perversion grows
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.440]   and you get stuck in this cycle
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.180]   and sexual perversions or any kind of sinful perversions
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.900]   are real and they grow when they're fed.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.720]   That's the lie of one last time.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.660]   When you feed it one more time, it gets bigger.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.100]   So the next time it's actually more difficult
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.040]   to abstain from that.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.500]   Whether it's being addicted to cocaine
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.740]   or addicted to negative attention from men.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.780]   It could be any of that thing.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.820]   I want attention from guys and I realize
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.500]   when I wear my shirt low, they give me attention.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.900]   And so I'll just wear it lower and lower.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.500]   And then all of a sudden I'm doing something
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.980]   that I promised I never would do.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.760]   Because I'm an addict of attention from men.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.260]   I fed the monster.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.440]   And so what can we do?
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.960]   Where's the hope?
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.740]   We carry our worst enemies within us, Spurgeon said.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.440]   So what is it that we need to do
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.040]   if we become friends with the monster?
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.040]   Eminem actually knows the answer.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.300]   He articulates it very well.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.760]   Let me give it to you.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.400]   I think it went wandering off down yonder
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.380]   and stumbled onto Jeff Van Vonderen.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.920]   Does anybody know who that is, Jeff Van Vonderen?
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.080]   He's the host of the reality show on A&E, The Intervention.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.580]   Eminem's a genius.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.280]   And I stumbled onto Jeff Van Vonderen
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.060]   'cause I need an interventionist
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.580]   to intervene between me and this monster
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.340]   and save me from myself and all this conflict
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.720]   'cause the very thing that I love's killing me
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.000]   and I can't conquer it.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.300]   My OCD's conking me in the head, keep knocking.
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.840]   I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying,
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.500]   don't shoot the messenger.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.000]   I'm just friends with the monster that's under my bed.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.520]   Get along with the voices inside of my head.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.860]   Did you just hear Eminem preach the gospel?
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.760]   He just said,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.200]   there's me and the monster,
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.880]   which we've defined is our sin, the sin within us.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.220]   Paul says it's the sin within us.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.280]   He says there's me and there's the sin within us
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.720]   and I need someone to go between
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.000]   and fight this battle for me.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.920]   I need someone to intervene for me.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.960]   Who will save me?
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.380]   Paul says this, Romans 7, verse 24.
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.460]   What a wretched man am I.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.560]   Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.460]   Thanks be to God
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.500]   who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.460]   He's the interventionist you're looking for, Eminem.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.500]   Romans 8, 1, the next chapter says,
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.480]   therefore there is now no condemnation
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.260]   for those who are in Christ Jesus
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.100]   because through Christ Jesus the law
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.780]   or the principle of the spirit who gives life
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.500]   has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.500]   For what the law was powerless to do
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.940]   because it was weakened by the flesh,
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.040]   this is what this means,
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.240]   is that the law can't save me because I can't keep it.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.100]   See, if I could keep the law perfectly,
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.540]   then the law could save me,
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.140]   but the law is these instructions from God
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.140]   I can't keep, therefore it can't save me.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.460]   It was weakened by what?
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.440]   My own sinful desire.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.680]   My own sinful desire made it to where the law
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.360]   couldn't save me because I couldn't keep it.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.440]   God did, so what the law was powerless to do
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.760]   because it was weakened by the flesh,
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.740]   God did by sending his own son
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.660]   in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.260]   This is the intervention.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.260]   And so he condemns sin in the flesh.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.660]   In order that the righteous requirement of the law
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.540]   might be fully met in us who do not live
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.800]   according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.840]   And so the second question is,
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.340]   who will save me from the monster?
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.180]   And the answer is Jesus Christ.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.920]   The answer is the gospel.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.460]   The text says, Romans 8, 1,
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.260]   for there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.440]   What is that no condemnation?
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.460]   I get lost in that.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.040]   And so in the Greek, what it literally translates is,
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.960]   there is now no punishment for sin,
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.220]   for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:19.820]   Now it's talking specific, of course, eternal punishment.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.180]   God does not punish eternally
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.420]   those who have trusted in Jesus Christ.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.680]   There's no punishment for them.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.440]   That's good news, guys.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.860]   You will not be eternally punished for your sin
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.340]   because Jesus was punished in your place for your sin.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.920]   Jesus paid the price for when you followed the monster.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.340]   The times you followed the monster,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.380]   the times you become friends with the monster
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.620]   under your bed, as Rihanna says,
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.340]   he actually has paid the price for those times,
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.380]   and he not only has paid the price,
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.800]   but he gives you something new to follow.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.520]   He gives you something new to follow.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.500]   Okay, so there's two things
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.740]   absolutely true about Christians.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.760]   Every Christian in the room,
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.620]   every person here who has trusted in Christ
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.700]   for the forgiveness of their sins,
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.720]   they're gonna be with God forever.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.420]   There's two things that are true for you.
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.080]   One, you will eternally get away with your sin.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.780]   What I mean by that is you will not have to pay
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.220]   for your sin after death, past, present, and future sin.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.940]   Eternally, you get away with it.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.120]   Christians get away with it.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.740]   Why, why do they get away with it?
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.380]   Because Christ paid for it in their place.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.220]   It's a great exchange.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.860]   He got what you deserve, therefore you get what he deserves,
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.500]   being a perfect God, eternity with God.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.900]   That's good news for sure.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.240]   Okay, the second thing that's true for Christians,
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.100]   now listen to this part.
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.840]   So first thing that's true
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.180]   is eternally you get away with sin.
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.760]   Second thing that's true
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.420]   is you will never get away with sinning
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.240]   because the Spirit of God is going to pursue you
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.660]   and chase you and convict you
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.380]   and tell you it's wrong.
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.100]   First thing, you eternally get away with sin.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.100]   The second thing that's true, eventually,
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.760]   at some point, now or in the future,
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.220]   the Spirit of God is gonna taunt you down
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.140]   in the most loving way he can and say, "Hey, that's wrong.
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.380]   "I've been telling you that's wrong.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.020]   "You just have not been listening to me.
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.600]   "You've been listening to the voices in your head.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.760]   "You've gotten along with a monster that's under your bed."
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:25.360]   And so Jesus did not just give his life for you,
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.860]   he gave his life to you.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.700]   Let me say that again.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.960]   Jesus did not just give his life for you,
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.960]   he gave his life to you in the form of the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.420]   And this Holy Spirit, this is our other interventionist.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.640]   It's the same one as Jesus,
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.140]   but now it's Jesus' Spirit who stays with us
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.880]   and shows us the way.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.280]   God's Spirit is with you.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.420]   If you're a believer in the room,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.980]   God's Spirit lives with you and directs your path.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.060]   The world has always been trying to show and display
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.480]   this reality, this theological reality that exists
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.120]   in the world that it has created.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.600]   Atheists have tried to understand this.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.020]   Buddhism tries to give an understanding of this.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.420]   Hinduism tries to give an understanding of this.
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.120]   The Islamic faith, Jewish faith,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.660]   all faiths that exist out there try to explain
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.520]   this reality of good and evil.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.660]   I'll give you another example.
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.440]   When I was 18, well, when I was 16 years old,
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.120]   there was a brand called Mossimo.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.520]   Anybody heard of Mossimo?
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.820]   It was the real deal when I was 16.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.100]   And so Mossimo had this angel and this devil on the shirt.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.000]   You guys remember this?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.100]   There was an angel and devil.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.380]   I desperately wanted to get that angel tattoo, okay?
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.920]   That was a dream that came true on my 18th birthday.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.840]   I got it right here.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.620]   I got the Mossimo angel right here.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.720]   Now, it wasn't just the Mossimo angel, though.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.680]   There was a Mossimo angel and a Mossimo devil.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.900]   Okay, I lost some of you on Mossimo.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.320]   And then what happened is then Target bought the brand
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.040]   and it became the most uncool tattoo anybody could have.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:48.880]   And so I've got it.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.620]   Sad day.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:57.420]   I'll go Disney with you for a minute.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.100]   Goofy.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:00.940]   There's this cartoon.
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.800]   It keeps playing in my head.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.520]   And it's like where Goofy has the opportunity
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.940]   to do something bad.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.120]   And this angel pops up and this devil pops up.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.660]   And the angel says, "No, you can't do it."
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.320]   And the devil says, "No, you can.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.220]   "Go ahead, it's no big deal."
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.960]   And what he ends up doing, and he sits there
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.340]   and you see this kind of, this trial.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.000]   And he ends up knocking off the angel
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.020]   and then becoming friends with the monster.
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.420]   And he says, "Let's go, partake."
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.060]   And then later on, he puts the monster in a cage
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.020]   and the angel and they go and do good together.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.540]   This is how the world has portrayed this.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.980]   Except for that breaks down, that's dualism.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.980]   It's not a devil and an angel.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.980]   It's a devil or a demon.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.220]   It's actually, it's not even that, I'm sorry.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.500]   That's terrible theology.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.020]   It's your flesh, your own desires,
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.700]   and the God, the creator of the heavens and the earth
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.860]   who formed you in your mother's womb,
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.520]   who made even Satan.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.180]   Who made all things.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.760]   The most powerful thing that you could ever think of.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.000]   He invented power.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.400]   All power is his, he's sovereign.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.560]   It's not dualism, it's not good and evil at war
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.960]   and who's gonna win.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.300]   It's evil and then it's God.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.840]   That's good news, okay?
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.760]   And God wins.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.960]   We've read the back of the book.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.800]   We know how this goes.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.040]   God wins, okay?
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.960]   And so, but the reality is, is some of you like Goofy,
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.240]   and I know that's Goofy,
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.000]   but some of you like Goofy have said,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.320]   "Hey, God, I just wanna be friends
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.480]   "with the monster for a little while."
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.620]   I had someone tell me today,
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.040]   "You know, I don't really feel bad
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.580]   "about what I do on the weekends."
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.200]   To which I said, "As lovingly as I possibly could,
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.600]   "that should really concern you
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.720]   "because the spirit will always convict you of sin
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.160]   "and so if you're doing something
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.560]   "that the scripture has said is sinful
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.640]   "and you don't feel a conviction,
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.280]   "that in and of itself is evident
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.040]   "that the spirit of God is not at work in your life."
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.200]   And that's the most loving thing I can tell you.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.520]   If you're sinning and there's not a conviction there,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.120]   the spirit of God may not be at work in your life,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.080]   meaning you may not have actually trusted in Christ
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.200]   for the forgiveness of sin
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.480]   so that the spirit of God is deposited with you
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.840]   in your life to guide and direct you
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.280]   because that is the evidence of the real believer
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.400]   that the spirit of God would direct their steps.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.960]   Not that you don't sin, but that when you do sin,
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.720]   the spirit of God convicts you of that sin.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.120]   When you do follow your flesh instead of the spirit,
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.080]   that you would feel a conviction there.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.240]   And so you literally have God inside of you directing you.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.040]   And so your course of action then
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.000]   is to tune out the monsters,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.600]   to have a sinful desire and to listen to the spirit.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.800]   And so what does it mean when it says
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.640]   the righteous requirement of the law
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.840]   might be fully met in us who do not live
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.160]   according to the flesh but according to the spirit?
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.240]   Here's what it means.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.320]   It means that as you live by the spirit,
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.160]   you pursue a holy life.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.760]   As you live and listen to the spirit,
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.040]   as you feed the spirit of God
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.840]   through the fruits of the spirit in your life,
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.120]   he is making you holy.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.160]   He is making you like Christ.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.800]   Christ's spirit is in the process of making you like him.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   That's called sanctification.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.760]   Okay, so how am I sanctified, JP?
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.920]   It is simple as listening to the right voices
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.360]   and tuning out the wrong ones.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.320]   This weekend, girls were about to start school.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.120]   And so we kind of had one last hurrah at the pool.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.720]   We went to the neighborhood pool.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720]   We're hanging out there.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.040]   My son, he's 23 months old.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.800]   He can't swim, and so he has to wear
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.240]   this goofy little puddle jumper.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.080]   It's what it's called.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.880]   It's like a big life jacket.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.960]   And so he has to put that on before he gets in the water
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.920]   so that he can just kind of float around and chill.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.360]   And we hadn't put it on him yet.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.240]   And we set him down.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.360]   We're kind of unpacking the bags.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.840]   And he's running.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.360]   And so this pool is like full of people.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.640]   And so just picture like 100 people at a pool.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.440]   And so he's kind of, he begins actually slowly walking
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   towards the side of the pool.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.480]   He sees the water, and then he kind of increases his step,
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.840]   to which I responded kind of poorly.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.200]   And I just go, "Weston, stop!"
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.240]   I'm there with the community guy,
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.360]   and he's like, "Whoa, dude."
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.360]   And so what it looked like, it literally looked like
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.440]   if you're watching a DVD and someone pushed pause.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.480]   I mean, the entire 100 people at the pool
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.600]   just stopped what they're doing and looked at me.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.360]   I mean, there were kids in the air just frozen
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.200]   looking at me.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.520]   And so they looked at me, and except for,
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.520]   there was one thing moving, little Weston.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.400]   He kind of looked, and he's like,
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.000]   "No, I don't think so," right?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.440]   And so here's what's happening.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.020]   Is Weston going to listen to his desires, he wants to swim,
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.440]   or is he going to listen to a father who loves him
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.400]   and doesn't want him to die?
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.640]   I mean, that's, and it's funny, it's funny, okay?
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.600]   But it's the same thing that you're in the middle of
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.900]   right now.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.400]   Are you going to listen to that,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.520]   what you really, really, really, really, really, really want
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.280]   called your desire?
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.000]   Are you going to listen to a father who loves you,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.640]   sees the future and the past, and doesn't want you to die?
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.720]   He loves you, he's for you.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.020]   But I really, really, really, really love him.
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.920]   I know you do, and I really, really, really, really,
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.960]   really love you.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   And I have paid a price so that you don't have to follow
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.640]   what you really, really, really, really, really want to do.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.520]   That you can follow something else,
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.220]   my spirit inside of you.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.940]   My spirit that lives with you.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:58.460]   Paul says, verse five,
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:03.480]   those who live according to the flesh, i.e. the monster,
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.420]   have their minds set on what the flesh desires.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.540]   But those who live in accordance with the spirit
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.620]   have their minds set on what the spirit desires.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.780]   The mind governed by the flesh is death,
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.540]   but the mind governed by the spirit is life and peace.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.300]   Jump to verse 12, he's going to say that same idea again.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.300]   And then in verse 12 he says,
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.240]   therefore, brothers and sisters,
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.180]   therefore, believers, therefore, porch,
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.420]   therefore, watermark, therefore, the village,
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:33.420]   IBC, Christians, the saints, we have an obligation.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.980]   But it is not to the flesh to live according to it,
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.640]   for if you live according to the flesh, you will die.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.020]   But if you live by the spirit,
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.400]   you put to death the misdeeds of the body.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.800]   You will live, you will find life.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   And so my third question is simply this,
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.080]   tonight, who are you going to listen to?
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.680]   Who will you listen to?
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.320]   It says when you feed your flesh,
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.000]   your mind is set on what it desires.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.320]   Tell me this isn't true.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.920]   Tell me this isn't true.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.560]   Tell me you don't look at pornography,
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.320]   go to work and think about pornography.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.520]   Tell me you don't get drunk
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.600]   and then can't wait to get drunk again.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.120]   Tell me you don't meet some dude
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.680]   who you know is not good for you,
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.940]   but you can't change your mind.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.080]   You just keep thinking about him.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.960]   Tell me when you feed the flesh,
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.420]   your mind is not stuck on that which you fed your flesh.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.520]   Paul said it thousands of years ago.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.400]   This is what's going to happen to you.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.800]   When you feed it, it's gonna spin around.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.540]   You're going to listen to the voices inside your head.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.240]   Rihanna says.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.440]   But when you live by the Spirit,
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.340]   your desires are conformed to what the Spirit desires.
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.360]   Do you see why we say read your Bible?
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.960]   Because it's the word of God.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.580]   God's words, God's voice become familiar to you.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.440]   I hear you, I see your commands, I see your desires.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.840]   God, I have a greater understanding of who you are.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.000]   I'm listening, God.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.580]   It's not just to check the box.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.560]   It's not a punishment.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.440]   Hey, you better read a chapter of Romans today.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.920]   No, no, it's like God, I want to know you,
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.140]   who you are and what you desire for me.
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.160]   God, I want to hear you.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.720]   You've got to speak louder to me
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.760]   than the monster inside my head.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.320]   This is why we pray.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.200]   God, I want to hear you.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.720]   This is why you're in community,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.640]   because God speaks to you through people
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.400]   who are yielded to his Spirit in your life.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   Friends, I really want to date her.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.800]   And they're like, no, but she's no good for you.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.840]   I don't know, this thing inside me says she is good for me,
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.120]   but we're telling you, yielded to the Spirit of God,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.280]   that she's not.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   But it seems like she is.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.080]   I know, but she's not.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.380]   Right?
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.600]   This is what's going on.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.800]   This is what's happening.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.840]   And so the world's, what happens when you have
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.160]   the Spirit of God inside of you,
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.280]   the world's ways become difficult.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.760]   It actually becomes more difficult to sin.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.760]   You can still sin, but you desire to follow God.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.560]   There's something else in you at war within you
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.920]   when you have the Holy Spirit saying,
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.720]   hey, no, sin is not bad.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.720]   I'm not talking about your conscience now.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.360]   I'm talking about the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.440]   Some of you have mistaken your conscience
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.340]   for the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.240]   Those are two different things.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.960]   I'm not just talking about your natural conscience,
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.400]   which exists as evidence that there is a God creator.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.160]   I'm talking about his Spirit within you
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.360]   making you like Jesus.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.000]   And so you may still desire to sin,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.920]   but there's something competing with that desire.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.520]   It says we have an obligation to live by the Spirit.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.480]   What does that mean, we have an obligation?
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.240]   Think about it like this.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.800]   If I've paid for you to go somewhere,
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.520]   I purchased your ticket, you have an obligation to go
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:59.440]   because it's been paid for, but you still have a choice.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.600]   Do you see that?
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.600]   So Jesus has said, I have paid for you
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.720]   so that you no longer have to follow the monster,
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.680]   but you still have a choice.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.980]   I have paid the price so that you don't have to,
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.660]   but you do still have an option.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.400]   See, the non-believer, the non-Christian in the room,
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.520]   you don't have an option.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.080]   You only follow the monster.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.120]   You have no Spirit to follow.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.760]   That's why non-believers, when they sin,
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.400]   that should never surprise you.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.680]   They're just fulfilling their job description.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.800]   Sinners should sin.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.000]   Non-believers, those who do not know Christ,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.280]   non-Christians, they should sin.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.000]   It's the only thing that their flesh can do is sin.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.680]   But for the believers, Christ says,
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.840]   no, I have given you an obligation not to sin.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.440]   I have paid the price so that you don't have to sin.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.640]   I purchased your ticket, but you still have a choice.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:55.560]   And so believers now have a choice
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.880]   as His Spirit finishes His work within us.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.240]   And He says this, verse 13,
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   "But if by the Spirit you put to death
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.960]   "the misdeeds of the body, you will live."
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.560]   And so the command there is live by the Spirit,
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.760]   put to death the deeds of the flesh.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.720]   And so how do you put to death the deeds of the flesh?
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.000]   You kill the monster.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.960]   How do you kill the monster?
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.180]   Stop listening to Him.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:24.780]   Stop feeding Him with deeds.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.960]   Stop listening to Him.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.780]   Stop obeying Him.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.000]   Stop being His prisoner.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.480]   Stop being His friend, as Rihanna would say.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.900]   Stop listening to Him.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.540]   There's a movie that I love called "A Beautiful Mind."
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.440]   I don't know if you've seen it.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.360]   If you haven't, heads up, I'm about to ruin it, okay?
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.200]   And you may wanna see it, so close your ears or something.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.080]   At the end of "A Beautiful Mind,"
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.800]   the movie's about this man who's brilliant,
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.280]   but he's also schizophrenic.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.080]   What that means is he actually sees this other guy
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.360]   who talks to him and tells him to do bad things.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.680]   And so he sees the dude and the guy's no good for him,
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.960]   and the guy convinces him to do things that are not good,
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.680]   things that appear crazy to other people,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.320]   'cause they were.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.560]   And so at the end of this,
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.080]   and he takes medication for schizophrenia,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.680]   but the medication has other side effects in his life
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.760]   that he decides the medication's not worth it,
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.560]   the side effects are not worth the medication.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.520]   And so what he has to do is he has to learn
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.440]   not to listen to the guy who he still sees
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.800]   and tells him to do things.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.120]   And so at the end of the movie,
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.460]   you see him, Russell Crowe, and he's there,
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.640]   and the guy is there, the guy who the whole movie's
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.080]   been telling him to do things,
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.360]   and the guy is there, and Russell Crowe sees him,
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.320]   and then he asks someone else,
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.480]   he goes, "Let me ask you a question, sir.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.400]   "Do you see a man over there in the corner?"
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.040]   To which the guy says, "No."
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.200]   And he goes, "I didn't think so."
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.240]   And he moves on.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.040]   And so what he does is he's never healed of schizophrenia,
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.960]   he just stops listening to the voice in his head.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.800]   He says, "It's still there, I'm just,"
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.480]   he just stops trusting his feelings and his emotions.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.800]   That's the same thing for us, right?
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.600]   Like some of us, we have these strong feelings and emotions
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.240]   that surpass logic, he beats me, but I love him.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.240]   Okay, that hurts me, but I want to.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.720]   That's not good for me, but I really, really,
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.800]   really, really want to.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.800]   And we just stop trusting our emotions and feelings,
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.360]   and we begin to trust the Spirit as he conforms
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.020]   our emotions and feelings to what he desires
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.820]   as he makes us like Jesus.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.600]   That's what we're doing.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.880]   And so you stop listening to the monster,
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.480]   you start listening to the Spirit.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.800]   And so what does this look like?
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.680]   Let me try to make this more even practical.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.000]   My two little girls, every now and then,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.080]   they're afraid of monsters.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.400]   And so what this looks like is I'll be in bed,
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.160]   usually sound asleep, and I'll hear, "Daddy!
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.960]   "Daddy!"
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.080]   And they will not stop until I get up.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.520]   And so I eventually get up, and I go in the room,
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.960]   and it's like, "I'm afraid!"
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.800]   What are you afraid of?
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.600]   "That thing, it's a monster!"
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.040]   I'm like, "Okay, what do I do?"
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.680]   I turn on the light, like, "It's not a monster,
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.040]   "it's a towel hanging on the door."
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.840]   You see, it's not a monster, it's just a towel.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.460]   And so I turn on the light, and I show them
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.280]   that it's not a monster, and then I sit down on their bed,
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.700]   and it works like, it looks like this every single time
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.120]   this happens, about once a week.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.660]   I say, "Hey, listen, there are no monsters.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.620]   "They're demons."
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.960]   No, that scared them.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.600]   I did that.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.240]   Truth be told, I did do that once,
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.840]   and then I realized that was not wise.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.000]   She didn't sleep for weeks.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.780]   But no, no, just let me reel you back real quick.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.880]   I say, I turn on the lights, I expose it,
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.400]   and then I tell the truth.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.240]   And so when you have a strong feeling or emotion,
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.100]   you expose it.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.000]   Hey, friends, I just wanna tell you,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.800]   I really, really wanna buy that purse.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.920]   Hey, I just wanna tell you, I really, really,
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.760]   really wanna date that girl.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.440]   I really wanna date that boy.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.880]   I really, really wanna go out this weekend.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.640]   Man, I just feel like getting wasted this weekend.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.560]   Yeah, I really, really wanna do that.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.080]   You turn on the light, you expose it,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.000]   and you won't want to.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.960]   Like, I just wanna give you a heads up,
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.720]   you won't want to do that.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.640]   Satan will be right there like,
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.600]   hey, you don't need to expose it.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.440]   You don't need to tell them.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.320]   You don't need to say that.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.920]   Hey, justify, justify, justify, justify.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.000]   Rationalize, rationalize, rationalize, rationalize.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.460]   And you say, hey, guys, I wanna tell you right now,
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.700]   I really wanna do that.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.960]   Right?
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.240]   And so you turn on the light,
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.280]   and then you pursue the truth.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.100]   What is the truth?
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.560]   What does God want for me?
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.760]   That's better than that.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.320]   And that's how you kill monsters.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.800]   You turn on the light, you expose them,
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.680]   and you pursue the truth.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.000]   You listen to the Spirit.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.880]   And so here's the truth.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.580]   As a believer, you have the truth inside you.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.920]   You're learning to listen to it.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.440]   And Spurgeon again says,
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.120]   "Beware of no man more than of yourself.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.200]   "We carry our worst enemies within us."
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.060]   And so in summary,
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.240]   the monster within us is our sinful nature.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.320]   But Christ saves us from the consequences
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.920]   of following the monster,
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.720]   and gives us his Spirit to follow instead.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.080]   For Christians, those who have trusted in Christ,
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.440]   for the forgiveness of their sins.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.600]   And we put to death this monster by not listening to him,
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:09.040]   but rather listening to God's Holy Spirit within us.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.600]   And so in closing, I read this,
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.640]   and I just thought I'd read it to you.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.560]   It's a old Native American tale
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.560]   about a Cherokee Indian talking to his grandson.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.400]   He says this.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.680]   An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:31.040]   "A fight is going on within me," he said to the boy.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.960]   "It is a terrible fight, and it is between two wolves.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.880]   "One wolf is evil, he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret,
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.660]   "greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment,
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:49.660]   "inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego."
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.220]   And he continued, "The other wolf is good.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:59.140]   "He is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:06.620]   "goodness, gentleness, faithfulness,
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:11.620]   "self-control, benevolence, empathy, generosity,
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.620]   "truth, and compassion."
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.900]   The same fight, he said, is going on inside of you
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.480]   and inside every other person, too.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.740]   And the grandson thought about it for a minute
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.220]   and then asked his grandfather, "Which wolf will win?"
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:32.780]   And the old Cherokee simply replied, "The one you feed."
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:38.380]   The one you feed.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.100]   Everyone here is feeding something.
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:45.220]   Paul says it like this in Galatians,
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.340]   "Whoever sows to please their flesh,
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.720]   "from their flesh will reap destruction.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.220]   "But whoever sows to please the Spirit,
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.180]   "from the Spirit will reap eternal life."
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.580]   So I'm asking you this evening,
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.380]   what are you feeding that's growing?
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.420]   Let me pray.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:10.140]   Father, we can't fight the monster by ourselves.
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.180]   As you know and you see,
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:18.340]   we can't overcome our sinful nature without you
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.500]   and we desperately need your help
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.980]   to kill the monster within us,
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.980]   to put to death the deeds of the flesh,
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.680]   to yield to your Spirit at work within us.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.640]   Help us to hear you, God.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.200]   Help us to separate your voice from the rest.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.500]   Help us to have the courage to walk in obedience.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.820]   Thank you so much that you sent Jesus Christ
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.540]   to die for our sins, to pay the price for our sins,
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.060]   and that you overcame death on our behalf
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.260]   so that we could be with you forever, God.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:52.620]   That we don't have to listen to our sinful desires anymore.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:53.960]   We don't have to follow them.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.400]   We have an obligation that is not to the flesh,
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.560]   but to your Spirit.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.540]   Would you help us follow that obligation, God?
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.280]   You're such a good God to us.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.860]   Thank you for the ways you lead us.
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.780]   Thank you for the ways you desire to give us life
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.300]   like a loving father desires to give life to his son.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.780]   You desire life for us.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:21.260]   We applaud not the performance, not the singing.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:25.060]   We applaud that incredible truth.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.280]   Jesus, we long to be like you.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.420]   Some of you are here and you're like,
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:33.940]   man, I wanna put to death the deeds of the flesh.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.900]   I wanna stop following that sinful nature.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:36.740]   You said expose it.
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.580]   Expose it, too.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.420]   I don't even know.
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.980]   Everybody I know in my life's doing the same things
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.620]   I'm doing and not feeling bad about it.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.660]   We wanna help.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:48.340]   Every week we say this idea about open community group,
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.300]   which means right now for men, right down this hallway,
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.000]   there's a room full of guys that say,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.260]   hey, we'd love to get to know you and run with you
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.580]   and share Christ with you and talk more about that.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.860]   We call that here community.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.480]   You might have heard it small groups
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.320]   or cell groups or home groups.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.940]   Here we call it community groups.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.860]   You can hear more about that in that room.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.740]   If you're a girl, you walk down this hallway,
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.140]   it's right in that room, right outside the hallway,
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.780]   there's something going on in there.
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.300]   It's the same thing for ladies.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.660]   We're glad you're here.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.500]   I love running with you and enjoying this series with you.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.980]   I've been stretched by the scriptures as well.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:26.420]   Super excited about this weekend.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.180]   I do wanna invite you to pray.
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.500]   Just give you a heads up that if you didn't get in,
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.540]   that in just a few months, we'll open registration up again
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.920]   and we hope you'll join us then.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.380]   But please do partner with us in prayer.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.220]   We would love that.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.620]   And for the rest of you, I can't wait to be with you
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.720]   in just a few days.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.560]   I love you guys.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.420]   Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:49.000]   (congregation applauding)
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:54.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:45:04.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
