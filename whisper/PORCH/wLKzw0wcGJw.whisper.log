[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   [Music]
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   All right, well, we're continuing this series, but I wanted to start by just addressing
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   clearly everything going on. And I hate that what I'm about to do is going to fall so short
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   of communicating and expressing how tremendously grieved, hurting, sad, confused, shocked,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   and just really heartbroken over not just the death of George Floyd, but the pain that
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   is rippling through so many people, but especially inside the church, and our black and brown
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   brothers and sisters in Christ. I have been sick all day and this weekend thinking about
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and praying about and fasting about how to use just the moments we have here tonight.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And I want you to know that we are standing with you, that we are praying with you, and
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   that I see you as more family and more blood than members of my own family who don't know
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Jesus. There's a saying that blood is thicker than water, which means just family runs deeper
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   than friendships. And while blood is thicker than water, the cross is thicker and stronger
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   than them both. And you are our brothers and our sisters, and we mourn and are just really
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   grieved alongside of you, and are listening. And when you hurt, we are hurting with you
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   and are so grateful that we get to be in a family that has all of the different spectrums
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   of ethnicity and race. And you matter, and all the pain that you're feeling, we are heartbroken
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   over. So let me pray, and we'll dive in. Father, I do thank you that because of the cross of
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Christ, every person, red, yellow, black, and white, who trusts in you is connected
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   and bonded and sealed and kindred spirits for all of eternity because they have the
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Holy Spirit. I pray that you would continue to eradicate and expose and remove injustice,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   racism, police brutality, and all kinds of evil from our land. Would you help us as the
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   church to cling to you, to love one another, and to look like you did when you walked this
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   earth? So help us, God. Would you fill in gaps just with your grace, even on... I know
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   there are no words and no things that can be said that in a message can heal so much
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   of the pain that's being felt. But you can. So help us. In Christ's name, amen.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Well, if you're listening and joining us online, there's a handful of friends and volunteers
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   that are here. And I thought I'd start by asking just a question, or give us some direction
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   for where we're going tonight. If there was one sin that you could remove from the
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   earth, what would it be? One that you are most angry, opposed to... What would you say?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   What would you say? Yeah. Pride. Pride. What would you say? Lust. Lust. Murder. Murder.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Other ones? Rape. Prejudice. Abuse. Hatred. Jealousy. Jealousy. That's a great Winster
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   move. I think if you look at Scripture and you ask that question, which sin is God most
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   opposed to, there's one that over and over and over he seems to highlight, and it is
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   the sin of pride. He says in Proverbs 8, chapter 8, verse 13, "I hate pride and arrogance,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   evil behavior and perverse speech." He says in Isaiah chapter 57, verse 15, "The high
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and lofty one, God, who lives in eternity, the Holy One, says this, 'I live in a high
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   and holy place, and with those whose spirits are humble, are contrite and humble.'" He
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   says, "Hey, I dwell not only in eternity and heavens of heavens and the highest place,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   but also only with the humble." Over and over and over the Scriptures say God is opposed
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   to the proud. He gives grace to the humble. The image is like, hey, you're in a boxing
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   ring. You got you over here if you're proud, and God over here. And that's how he feels
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   towards pride. What's crazy about pride is honestly it's one of the more acceptable sins,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I think, in most of our lives or in my life. Like if I was up here and I was like, hey,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I've just been struggling with any of the ones or a lot of the ones that you just named.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Like, hey, I've been struggling with abuse, or I've been struggling with, you know, having
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   sex outside of marriage with someone other than my wife. Most of you would be like, dude,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   what? You just lost the right to talk up here. But if I was to say, man, I've been struggling
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   with pride, most of us would be like, who isn't, right? Like it's one of the more acceptable
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   ones that we feel or we're almost so accustomed to. And yet when you read the Bible over and
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   over and over, God is so clear. I am opposed to pride. Partially because so many of the
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   other sins we're going to talk about in this series of seven deadly sins, which is a funny
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   title because every sin is by definition deadly. The wages of sin is death, the Bible says.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   But we're just grabbing these huge pillars of sins that our generation can wrestle with
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   and tonight on pride. And one of the reasons God is opposed to it is because as many theologians
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   have said for a long time, you can trace the root of so many other sins back to pride.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   C.S. Lewis put it this way, sexual sin, anger, greed, drunkenness, etc. are all nothing in
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   comparison to pride. It was through pride that the devil became the devil. In other
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   words, Satan was cast out of heaven because he wanted to be God, which was pride. Pride
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   leads to every other sin. It is the complete anti-God state of mind. God hates pride because
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   it kills relationships and pride will keep you out of heaven because it will not allow
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   you to say, I need a savior. The challenge of a message like this, let you into the preaching
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   world, is pride is a weird topic because people who are proud are not going to listen to a
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   message on pride because they don't think they need it. So it's a frustrating thing
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   because the people who actually need to hear it are the ones that are least likely to.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And so if you're listening right now and you're going, oh man, pride, that really doesn't
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   apply to me. I'm not really a prideful person. You are exactly the person I'm talking about.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And pride, to any degree that it creeps into our life, is always toxic and poisonous,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   especially to relationships. What we're about to discuss, if the church will do, it won't
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   overnight heal every problem that's taking place. It won't overnight remove and eradicate
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   racism, but it will move the church in the direction of unifying together and bringing
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   healing into our world, what we're about to talk about for the next 25 minutes. So I just
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   want to walk through Philippians chapter 2, where Paul talks about pride and humility.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I'm going to incorporate some other scriptures that will inform it, but I just want to talk
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   about how pride presents, what it looks like, what pride prevents in our life, and then
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   where pride ends. So if you're taking notes, those are the three ideas I just want to talk
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   through from Philippians chapter 2. Philippians, Paul wrote to the church in Philippi, this
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   letter that he wrote from a jail cell. Today we call it Philippians, or the letter of Philippians.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And here's what he says in verse 3 of chapter 2. "Don't be selfish. Don't try to impress
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   other people. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourself. Don't look out only
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   for your own interests, but take an interest or look out for the interests of others."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   As we launch into a conversation about pride and humility, one of the challenges is that
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   pride masquerades or wears different faces when it surfaces in our life. Like pride inside
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   of all of our lives looks different in different ways. It can come up and pop up, and it's
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   not always overtly, like sometimes it's easy to spot the guy who's like overly cocky, he's
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   still talking about his high school football days and how great he was, and just he's all
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   about himself. That person, it's clear, like man, that guy's arrogant, he struggles with
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   pride. But pride, this obsession with self and self-focus, which is what pride is, can
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   pop up in a lot of different ways. It can pop up as self-love, but it also pops up as
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   self-hate, because at the center of your thoughts and your focus and all of those is still self.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Both of those can be pride. Pride can pop up as insecurity, where I'm afraid to talk
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   and I'm afraid of what other people think about me, because at the center of your thought
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   is still you. I'm constantly looking. Like some people, like there are people who are
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   tremendously quiet who struggle with incredible pride, because they're just afraid. There's
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   times the Bible commands us to speak, and they're afraid to speak because they're afraid
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   of, "Oh no, what are people going to think?" That's pride. It's not always overtly clear
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   if somebody's struggling with pride. It can also look like being judgmental towards other
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   people, who struggle with sins, sexual attractions, who have challenges or struggles in their
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   life that you don't and you look down on, or I look down on them because of it. Pride
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   also looks like taking credit for things that you didn't earn, you didn't deserve, that
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   everything that you've been given, the Bible says, is all a gift of God's grace in your
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   life. Paul in 1 Corinthians 4, verse 7 says this, "What do you have that you did not receive?"
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   The way that you look, the mind that you have, the job that you have, the family you were
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   born into, the city that you live in, everything, Paul says, is something that's foolish to
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   be proud about, because all of it was a gift that you can't take credit for. You're not
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   responsible for being born into whatever family you were. And you may be thinking, "No, but
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I work hard at my job." You're not responsible for having the mind that God gave you that
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   allowed you to work, for having legs that allow you to get up and move around every
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   day. Paul says everything has been a gift from God and it's foolish, and pride looks
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   like, "Hey man, I'm taking credit because I worked really hard. I earned this." Pride
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   looks like entitlement instead of gratitude. I'm focused on what I don't have that other
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   people had. Again, at the center of that is self. Pride looks defensive. "Man, I hate
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   this one because I is this one." And that a lot of times in my life, defensiveness can
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   pop up where I will dismiss or defend or I don't want to listen. And at the center of
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   that is a pridefulness that thinks that I'm right. Pride can look in all these different
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   ways instead of like pride can look like shame. And you may be going, "Pride? Shame? Guilt?"
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   For a Christian who's trusted in Jesus, pride can look like shame because any time that
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   I rehearse that and I just get covered in shame, I am saying that my sin is more powerful
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   than the grace of God. Or my sin is more powerful than what Christ did. My actions are more
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   powerful than the actions Jesus took on the cross. Pride can pop up in all kinds of forms
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   in our life. It can look like being stressed out because I'm so worried and I feel like
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   the entire world rests on me, which is a lie. And that's pride. And it still has me at the
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   center of it. Pride can look like being easily offended. Like somebody who's prideful is
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   often easily offended because, "Hey, you hit self and the most important thing in the universe
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   is myself and you offended me." Pride can pop up in lots of different ways. Pride looks
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   like unwillingness to apologize until someone else owns their part. I know Josiah's been
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   there before and I'm totally kidding. We all have. Pride looks like I'm unable to see anything
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   other than the issues and the reasons why I'm justified in not doing something else
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   and I don't have to move towards that person. That's pride. Pride, even in this moment for
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   me, is more concerned about what you and you think of what I'm going to teach tonight than
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   what God thinks about what I'm going to teach tonight. Pride can pop up in lots of different
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   ways. One exercise that would be helpful you should consider doing, because pride is a
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   little bit like bad breath. If you have it, you can't really tell that you have it, is
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   to ask people in your life, "How do you think pride manifests itself in my life?" My guess
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   is they're going to have an answer. You probably won't like the answer because you're prideful,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   just like I am. But knowing, "How does pride pop up in my life?" This week I did that practice
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   with several different people and asked, "Hey, how do you feel like pride pops up in my life?"
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And the answer, multiple times, was, "You have a bent and in default, you think that
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   you are right, always. And that makes you less quick to listen and less quick to be
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   empathetic. And I hate it. And they're right. And I'm prideful. And there's areas where
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I need God to come in and expose and kill. I don't know what areas you have, but you
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   need to know, "How does pride pop itself up in my life?" And if you don't think it does,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   you have deceived yourself and you are prideful. And having other believers in your life that
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   can help you go, "Hey, this is how pride is going to pop up," or, "This is how I've seen
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   it pop up in your life." Ask them that question this week. If they take nothing else away
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   from this message, if you just get that, you will be on the step towards not allowing pride
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   to kill relationships and kill your faith. Paul, in defining humility, he also gives
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   us a look into what pride prevents us from having in our own life. So the second idea
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   from this text is just, here's what pride prevents, specifically, relationships. Pride
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   is the enemy of relationships. Like Paul is saying, "Hey, in humility, look to other people,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   care and be concerned about the needs of other people. Be less concerned about yourself and
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   more concerned about others." And pride comes in and it says, "Don't care about them. You
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   need to focus on you. They're all wrong." It begins to turn your focus inward and it
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   creates a prison where I begin to lock other people out. I lock God out and myself in,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   where I'm not willing to listen to others. Pride right now looks like a white person
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   saying, "I didn't do anything wrong," or, "I didn't do anything racist. Let's move on,"
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   without first listening. Pride can look like a black person saying, "Man, this is never
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   going to change. I'm over it. I'm done." Both of those things can be anchored in pride.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   And anytime pride is present, the enemy or Satan is working and winning and wants to
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   take that and drive as deep as he can a wedge and division because he hates relationships
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   and pride is the enemy of relationships. It kills them every single time. Pride will prevent
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   and shut you out from true greatness in your life because in order to be truly great, Jesus
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   said in Mark chapter 10, "That involves you serving other people, not focusing on yourself."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   In Mark chapter 10, verse 43, he said this, "Whoever wants to be great must be your servant."
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   He redefines what greatness is. This is what greatness is. This is why pride prevents you
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   from ever having true greatness, because you're unwilling to be a servant. "Whoever wants
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   to be first must be slave of all, for the Son of Man," that's God, "did not come to be
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many." Serving requires humility.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Pride also prevents you from growing. Proverbs chapter 12, verse 15, says, "The way of a
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   fool seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice." You know what's interesting about
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   that verse? I think everybody thinks, for the most part, what's right to them is right
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   to them. Like, most of us are not like, "You know, this is what I believe, but I'm pretty
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   sure I'm wrong." Most of us think, "I'm right." The difference in the verse is that one is
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   willing to listen to others and receive instruction and one is not. The fool is just saying, "I
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   know I'm right. I'll always be right. There's nothing I'm missing here." And the wise person,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   it's not that they don't still think they're right, they're just willing to listen. Pride
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   prevents you from growing because it prevents you from listening, from growing, from receiving
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   feedback from other people in your life and in your world. And to the degree that you
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   are unwilling to listen to others is the degree to which you are not going to grow. Grow in
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   your faith, grow in maturity, grow overall. Finally, pride prevents you from a relationship
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   with God. Pride prevents you from coming to a place where you say, "Man, I need a Savior.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I don't need just another chance. I'm not a good enough person." It prevents you from
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   seeing God as perfect and holy and you not being worthy of it. Jesus, in Matthew chapter
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   5, in one of the first words that we're told that he taught people, he said, "Blessed are
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   the spiritually poor or the poor in spirit for they will receive or for theirs is the
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   kingdom of heaven." What does it mean to be spiritually poor? It means I see myself as
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   not worthy, that if I'm going to have a relationship with the God who's there, it's not because
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   I earned it or I deserve it, it's because God is going to initiate and God has provided
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   a way for that to happen. If you can't come and candidly, this is the issue I think that
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   sends more people to hell than any other issue. They never arrive at a place where they see
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   themselves as, "Look, I'm not a good enough person. I'm not ever going to be deserving
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   of a relationship with God. I try to pay my taxes. I try to be nice. I give to the poor
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   every once in a while and five bucks to the guy in the corner, but I'm not a good enough
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   person." Most people hide behind like, "No, I'm really, at the end of the day, like I'm
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   a good person. God, you know, I'm sure he's going to accept good people." The Bible says
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   there are no good people and only those who recognize that they bring nothing to the table
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   and are willing to accept the free gift that God has given are going to experience eternity
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   with God. Pride doesn't just kill relationships here. It will end or keep you out of heaven.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   It's a thing that through Satan, as I mentioned early, and so pride is satanic in many ways.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   As I mentioned earlier, pride also puts you in the opposition of God. Over and over, three
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   times in the New Testament, it's the same phrase. It's really interesting. If you're
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   God and you're writing, you know, inspiring the writers and over and over, he includes
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   this phrase that, "Hey, God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. God opposes
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   the proud but gives grace to the humble. God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   It's as though he's defining or helping you see what people who God is along with or on
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   the same team as and those who he is opposed to or playing in opposition against. "Hey,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   these people who are on my team, they're clothed in humility. Those who are not on my team,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   they're clothed in pride." I mean, think about that. You guys remember when we had sports
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   RIP, when that was a thing? You could tell a team by what? You could tell who was on
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   the team by the jersey that they were wearing, right? From the biblical perspective, pride
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   is the jersey of the opposing team. That God says, "Man, if that is what you're wearing,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   you are in opposition to me." Anytime that is the attitude or the posture or the way
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   that you are operating, you and I place ourself in the opposition of the thing that God wants
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   to bless and that God does bless. God hates pride because it kills relationships and it
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   kills people's ability to have a relationship with him. Pride is the thing that is killing
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   our country right now. Pride was the original sin that was introduced when white superiority
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and white pride was introduced, that there could be inferior races. Pride continues to
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   plague and be a part of dismantling and dividing and creating division and unwillingness to
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   come together and say, "Man, I want to listen and I want to listen to you and I want to
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   hear." And both sides doing that will continue to perpetuate division and it is killing our
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   country. This obsessiveness of self is killing just society and it will kill our faith and
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   it will kill relationships. Do you guys know how many selfies a day are taken in the world?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Take a guess. A million. Not a bad guess. Two million? Hundred million? Close. 93 million.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   That is what I read this week. 93 million selfies. The selfie apparently came on the
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   scene in like 2011 and who knows if before that people were turning around a Kodiak camera
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   that they wind up and take it. But at least then with smart phone and all those things
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   that terminology kind of got launched on the scene and since then people have been taking
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   selfies. It is kind of a picture really of how society has only further moved more and
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   more towards a focus on self. Do you guys know there is something called selfie, death
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   by selfie? And it is pretty tragic honestly. Death by selfie is what they would term the
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   hundreds of people who in effort to get the best selfie possible ended up dying because
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   they fell off some cliff in Machu Picchu or they got attacked by a walrus that actually
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   happened or they fell off some cliff. In order to get the best possible picture of themselves
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   and the place that they were at they ended up losing their life. But through a selfie
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   and self-focus it cost them their life and it is costing the self-focused pride. Anytime
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   it enters any of our hearts it will cost you relationships, it will cost you future marriage,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   it will cost you your life and your eternal life if you are not willing to through humility
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   accept you are unworthy and undeserving of a relationship with God and it is killing
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   and will kill our country but it doesn't have to. And Paul says humility should mark the
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   people of God which brings us to our third point which is where pride ends. He lays out
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   what humility is and then he says this, "You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   had or the same mindset. Though he was God he did not think equality with God as something
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   to cling to. Instead he gave up his divine privileges, he took the humble position of
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   a slave, was born as a human being. When he appeared in human form he humbled himself
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   in obedience to God and died a criminal's death on the cross." Paul lays out and gives
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   us the greatest picture of humility that there could ever be and he says Jesus not only had
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   a mindset of humility it led him to actions and moved him to act in humility by humbling
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   himself to such a great extent that I'm confident no illustration I could possibly give would
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   put into words what it just said. The passage just said though he was God period anything
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   that it follows up with after that. That doesn't include he decided to destroy anybody who
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   opposed him or he decided you know I'm just going to start this whole universe over or
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I'm going to make up some anything that would involve him saying I'm going to go to the
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   world I created to become like one of the humans that I created and to die in the place
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   of all people everywhere and for all people everywhere. The analogy has been used that
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   it would be like you know if you had an ant farm and you were like man I want to save
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   this ant farm and so you decided because you were God you could become an ant you became
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   an ant and then the ant farm rallied around it was like get rid of him and they decided
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   to crucify and kill you. But even now it would fall incredibly short of the eternal perfect
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   holy God who came to this earth reflected perfection did nothing wrong was completely
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   wronged though he was completely right himself and yet he made the move and sought to reconcile
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   to such a length that it wasn't just you know he said he initiated the apology conversation
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   he was willing to move to such a degree that even if it cost him being crucified for people
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   who didn't respect him who didn't want him who didn't care about him he was willing to
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   do it. And Paul instructs that as a church what should Marcus is the mindset and the
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   movements of humility. It's been said that humility is not thinking less of yourself
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   it's thinking about others more or thinking about yourself less. It's moving towards people
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   in the conversation. It's moving towards and owning your part even before they've ever
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   said they're sorry. Humility is a thing that allows you to do things like this some of
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   you may have seen pictures of police officers and people protesting. Here's another one.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   You can't have that without humility. Here's another one or the last one. That's something
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   that doesn't take place unless one person is willing to say hey I'm not here to you
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   know choose sides or decide who's wrong or who's right I'm here to move towards unity
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   and healing and coming together and you cannot do that without humility. Peter says in 1
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Peter chapter 5 all of you clothe yourself with humility towards one another because
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   God opposes the proud but he shows favor to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   God's mighty hand that he may lift you up in due time. He says the analogy of wearing
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   humility continually it's like clothes that you wear just like you get up and every day
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   you put on clothes to go to your job you never would go to your job without wearing clothes.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Peter says that's the way you're to think about humility which makes sense because the
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   moment that humility is something that I'm like oh man I feel like I'm being humble right
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   now five minutes later I'm angry I'm defensive I'm dismissive I'm prideful and he says you've
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   got to constantly be putting this thing on like something that you wear. What's further
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   interesting is humility is one of those things that man it just looks good on everybody like
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   unlike pride that looks good on nobody like the guy who's like I want to talk about me
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   myself and I and let me tell you how great I am that guy is repulsive or that girl is
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   repulsive am I right like if you're listening and you want to be more attractive overnight
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I'm about to give you the key if you were hit by the ugly stick when you were born this
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   will make you more attractive by the time this message is over just be humble. Am I
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   wrong ladies? Am I right? Like the guy who's like hey I'm going to take credit I'm going
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   to give credit I'm going to serve I care about you they're going out of their way and they're
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   like I'm so sorry was that was that over the line you're like why are you even apologizing
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   right now and they are overly humble it's unbelievably attractive and the same thing
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   is how unattractive pride is in our lives it's at the same time not always very comfortable
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   to put on humility in other words it's like this thing that is so attractive when you
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   wear it but it's also uncomfortable you know kind of when you wear it because I think sometimes
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   we think like oh you know when I'm humble it'll feel comfortable I don't think it feels
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   comfortable all the time I think there's times where I have to be like look I don't want
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   to move forward in this conversation and own my part but that's because I'm prideful so
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   I'm making the decision I'm pushing through it I'm not letting pride own me I'm going
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   to decide hey will you please forgive me I'm going to make the phone call I'm going to
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   initiate and take the first step it's not always comfortable but it's the thing that
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   I'm supposed to wear it's like anything that our ladies probably can relate to there's
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   items of clothing that you're like yeah hey it's not the most comfortable but it's my
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   favorite item I feel like I like how I look the best in it this is just a dangerous ground
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   that I'm walking on right now but it's like that it's that item that it's not always comfortable
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   it's always attractive and it's always the thing that brings healing and allows relationships
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   to flourish and Peter says and the Bible affirms it's something that you and I are to put on
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   every single day I have a friend who thinks of just his day in the morning and he begins
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   to think through all the different ways he needs to put on humility as he anticipates
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   I'm going to go in that meeting I'm going to be tempted to be prideful or defensive
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   or angry or hurt or and I need to put on humility I want to think through the lens of the other
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   person I want to think through how to care for them and he says he goes through and every
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   single day he begins starts his day part of it by thinking through how do I put on humility
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   and everything that I'm going to face and experience today what does that look like
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   and Peter says every day you wake up you put it on you put it on the two ways that scripture
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   just pointed out is humility towards God and towards other people humility towards God
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   and then I trust God's timing hunter humble yourselves under God's mighty hand that he
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   will lift you up in due time I trust his timing over the circumstances and the story he's
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   writing in my life I trust his timing over when I'm going to get married I trust his
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   timing over the opportunities or lack of opportunities that I have at work I trust God in the midst
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   of all of it I'm humbling myself and trusting he's sovereign over everything that I'm experiencing
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   facing I trust him and then it's also acting towards others and serving other people it's
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   seeking to serve it's being humble towards other people seeking to be quick to listen
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   and put on humility through my actions I don't know what Jesus would call you in your life
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   right now to do in terms of humble but I know that that mindset is supposed to lead to actions
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   and all of us so some of us may need to leave this message and you got to go pick up the
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   phone you got to make a phone call whatever link he would call you to I know it's not
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   as far as he went by humbling himself to such a point that he would even die a criminal's
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   death on a cross I don't know where pride manifests itself in your life and I don't
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   know where you need to move in through the uncomfortable action of humility but to all
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   of us Jesus says this is the thing that brings healing and no one is being asked to go anywhere
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   or to any place that is farther than the links that I went for you for me humility really
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   is like habits like these humble habits and so as we kind of wrap up here's what I really
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   I hope you leave here I hope you hear me I want you to pick a fight with your pride I
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   want you to pick a fight and say hey I'm not going to let you control my life anymore like
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   you don't get to control my relationships anymore pride you for the last 22 years you
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   have decided whether or not I'm going to keep being friends with somebody because once I
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   get hurt I'm out of there once I accidentally hurt somebody I'm like oh they're so offended
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   so easily so I'm out of here we're not even friends anymore how long are you going to
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   live that way how long are you going to let pride decide and determine your relationships
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   how long are you going to let pride not allow you to have a relationship with your sister
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   or your parent or your old roommate or that friend how long are you going to hide behind
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   your pride and blame other people or point the finger be unwilling to own your part whatever
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   it is in whatever conflict there is how long I just want you to answer honestly to yourself
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   I think I'm going to do it for the rest of my life just own it just say it just live
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   in that and embrace it but for the rest of us the scripture clearly calls us hey I want
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   you to pick a fight with your pride it doesn't have to control you and the way that you decide
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   it's not controlling me is by pushing through even when it's uncomfortable I'm not going
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   to allow my feelings my pride to determine my life tragically most people never do that
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   and they go through and that's why our world is so dysfunctional so world runs on pride
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   a world loves pride feeds pride and there's nothing God hates more because it's killing
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   people and it's killing relationships and he says for the church it shouldn't be this
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   way conclusion how does pride manifest itself in your life what is pride preventing you
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   from like what relationships are now and how would God how would Jesus like if he if somebody
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   was going to sit down with you and be like hey Jesus called all of us to follow him with
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   our lives how would he begin to say hey I want you to follow me and act like I act and
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   be humble even when other people are not it's a really painful really uncomfortable experience
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   but it's one that as believers we've been invited to and when we do it brings healing
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   to the church and this is something man I don't know if it discourages or encourages
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   people who are listening I am prideful we do something called regeneration here at watermark
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   it's like a recovery thing and one of the three things that I entered into it was because
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   I have pride in my life and I hate it and it's through deciding and moving towards people
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   and not having to be right which is not always easy or being okay with not getting the last
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   word in or being okay with those things when those are marking my life typically it means
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   that I'm doing better with the battle of pride what's tragically happened and I'll close
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   here our world is so fed this narrative to put you in the middle like you're the focus
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I'm the focus of life and I'm the sinner and I should be the sinner and life is about me
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   and anyone who hurt me or anything that happened to me I need to focus on me focus on me me
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   me me me and life is not found there it's depressing narcissism leads to anxiety narcissism
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   like the obsession and focus of like the world revolves around me it leads to me cutting
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   off relationships it comes naturally but it leads to a place where I'm all alone I'm cut
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   off from God my intimacy with other friends or intimacy with God it cuts me off from my
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   wife and anytime that I buy the lie that hey man life is about you or you buy the lie that
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   life is about you you lose there was a astronomer in the 1500s named Nicholas Copernicus you
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   guys know who that is?
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Anybody hear of him?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Got a couple heads shaking somebody paid attention chemistry he basically came up with something
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   called the heliocentric theory heliocentric theory at that time introduced the idea that
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   hey I don't think the world revolves or the universe revolves around the earth the universe
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   revolves around the sun and people are like no that's crazy that can't be the case and
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   he was like I'm looking through these telescopes and I'm telling you guys I think we revolve
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   around the sun and there's something took place called a Copernican revolution where
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   people were introduced to the idea that oh the universe doesn't revolve around us it
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   revolves around the sun what needs to take place in the life of every single Christian
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   is embracing on a daily basis the world around me does not revolve around me it revolves
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   around the son of God and anytime that I put myself in the middle or I'm more concerned
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   about me and all of the things in my life that I am about God pride is invaded in and
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   having a revolution take place where I put back at the center of life Jesus all of life
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   revolves around Jesus you cannot experience the life that he wants you to have the life
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   that our world needs what our church needs to be without putting Jesus at the center
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   of the story all of it revolves around him and that response despite the fact that he
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   is at the center of the universe whether I believe it or accept it or not he took the
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   response that he is at the center of the universe but even though that was true he became a
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   man and humbled himself to the point of even dying on a cross and because of that because
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   of the reverse economy of way God works that opposite of our world around us God said hey
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   that name will be the name that above every other person on planet earth will be exalted
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   forever and ever and ever that whoever humbles himself will be exalted and he went to the
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   greatest length of humility and humbling himself and because of that Paul finishes the passage
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   and says this therefore God elevated him to the place of highest honor gave him the name
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   above every other name that is the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   on earth and under the earth and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   of the Father I don't know how we move forward or what it will look like when we move forward
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   but I know that scripture indicates that it only can happen if humility marks our life
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   and we come to the table and we listen and there is so much division and I hate it and
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   I hate any ways that I am contributing or have contributed to it or I hate even just
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   the pain that people are experiencing and I want to talk to my friends who have for
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   so long displayed humility and patience and grace who make up the black and brown brothers
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   and sisters in Christ the way that you so many of you have pushed through pain unspeakable
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   pain pain that candidly I don't know if this is surprising you I'm a white guy I'll never
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   actually experience or understand or totally be able to relate to and yet despite that
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   despite all the pain that has marked your life or maybe has been a part of the story
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   that God has written you patiently continue you endure suffering in the face of injustice
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   like I may never be able to experience or will probably never experience and you keep
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   going the way that you patiently come alongside other Christian believers and brothers and
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   sisters in the body of Christ you help them you engage in conversations you don't shame
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   them you don't dismiss them you walk with them and you look like Jesus and you inspire
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   me and you strengthen our church and you strengthen the body of Christ and I'm so grateful and
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   I like so many others when I see the pain and hurt my heart breaks but the answer and
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   the next step or whatever God's going to do in our church it will involve us coming together
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   and listening and loving we are blood because we have been bonded by the blood of Jesus
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   and I'm not going to do it perfectly and I haven't done it perfectly and I'll never do
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   it perfectly and I need your help and you need our help we are the only hope the world
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   has there's no solution if the people of God can't unite and be bonded what other hope
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   do we have but we can and it involves humility I don't know what actions you need to take
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   this week I know some of us need to reach out and we need to make phone calls we need
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   to follow up we need to ask others to help us see our pride in our life all of which
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   are just going to take steps in the direction of what Jesus says is true greatness steps
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   in the direction of being marked by the quality that has the potential to heal our world to
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   heal our hurts and to unite our church the body of Christ all over the world let me pray
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   father I thank you for just the ways that you are greater than the world around us you
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   are stronger you restore you heal you bring unity you know well what it was like to experience
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   injustice and I see in the reflection of many of my black brown friends I see you in them
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   because I see the way that they experience injustice it's not fair that's not right that's
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   not deserved and yet despite all of that they look to you they push through they respond
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   as you call them to and they look like you I pray that you would heal our land God you
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   would end the division at least in the church we can't be responsible for the division in
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   the world around us but we can as a body of Christ come together and so will you help
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   us I pray right now for every every word and every sentence that I just spoke that someone
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   out and right now is listening to that dismissed every other thing that I said because they
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   held on to that and rightly or wrongly heard something that discouraged them that you would
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   meet them where they are with grace you'd help us be your people forgive us for the
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   ways that we haven't been unite us together make us like Christ we worship you now in
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   song amen
