[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:22.720]   - All right, how about that transition?
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.560]   Let's go.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.760]   Man, welcome to the porch.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.600]   My name is David.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.360]   We are so excited to finish off this series tonight
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.880]   and dive in it with you.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.240]   Have you guys ever had something
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.000]   that ended up going away where you're like,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.280]   man, that is not how I saw that thing going.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.640]   Ever experienced this before?
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.400]   I'm gonna start off kind of tonight
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400]   by telling a experience in a dramatic fashion
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.420]   that this took place.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.360]   It was about a year ago.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.320]   My wife was pregnant with our son.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080]   We were gonna give birth in December.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.200]   The baby was gonna come as a little baby boy.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.920]   We decided that we were going to buy
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.600]   a foreclosure property in October.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.440]   That's right.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.000]   And we were going to remodel it all
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.640]   in the two months that we had before the baby came.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.720]   People will tell you, hey, don't ever buy a house
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.480]   and have a baby at the same time.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.800]   We decided to buy a house and remodel it
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.040]   and have a baby at the same time
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.480]   and essentially gave that thing a middle finger.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.280]   So that is where we were.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.160]   We're waiting for this baby to come
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.600]   and getting everything ready.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.240]   He's supposed to come December 16th.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760]   December 9th, I'm at work.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.520]   I'm getting ready for the Christmas concert
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.920]   that we're gonna have here.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.000]   Last year, my wife calls me.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.280]   We're waiting, we're about a week out.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.000]   The baby is still coming.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.600]   The house is supposed to be done on December 11th.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.960]   So we've got a very small window
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.120]   between the 11th and the 16th
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.600]   to get this house all in order.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.000]   We're gonna move in, have a baby.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.760]   It's gonna be great.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.840]   My wife calls me on December 9th,
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.000]   a week before the baby is due,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.360]   and she says, I'm leaving the doctor
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.320]   and I have to have an emergency C-section
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.540]   because this baby is humongous
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.960]   and has his father's head, which is humongous.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.720]   And she's saying, we have to get the baby out.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720]   He's too big.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.520]   And so I'm like, what does that even mean?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.320]   She's like, it means we have an appointment tomorrow
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.280]   at 9 a.m. and you're gonna be a daddy.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.380]   And I'm like, okay, great.
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.680]   I go home, go pack, get everything ready.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.600]   We're talking through it.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.880]   And really, this is not going how I saw this going.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.240]   Even the fact that we have an appointment
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.980]   at 9 a.m. to get the baby out was not how I saw this.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.960]   Guys, I think, have this fantasy
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.880]   where they're like, man, at least there's one time
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.560]   in my entire life where I can drive
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.360]   as fast as I want to to the hospital.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.640]   And if the police officer comes,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.260]   I'm like, we're having a baby, sir.
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.460]   We gotta keep moving.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.360]   She's having a baby, she's in labor.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.600]   And that's not at all what happens
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.360]   when you have a C-section 'cause it's like,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.880]   yeah, we're here for the nine o'clock appointment.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.720]   We'll check in.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.560]   [audience laughing]
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.060]   And so we get there and it just was not how I saw it going.
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.440]   We go, we check in.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.700]   They tell me, hey, we need you to put these scrubs on
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.800]   and we're gonna take her away
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.640]   and get her in the surgery room.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.280]   And I'm like, scrubs, what does that mean?
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.240]   They give me these clothes.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.600]   I put this on, got a little shower cap on,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.960]   everything, wearing blue.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.080]   They finally come get me after I'm sitting in this room
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.320]   for a while, they say, you can come in.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.020]   My wife is in there laying back on a table on laughing gas.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.480]   They put this sheet up in front of us.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.320]   I'm like, dude, this is not how I saw
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.760]   this whole thing going down.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.040]   And they put this sheet up and I'm sitting by my wife,
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.040]   her head up at the top of the table.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.800]   She's laying down and the doctors are gonna cut an incision.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.080]   That's what happens in a C-section, in the stomach.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.480]   And they pull the baby out.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.100]   And so I'm sitting there, I'm in the scrubs next to her.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.920]   She's on laughing gas, a little out of it.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.400]   And I asked the doctor, hey, can I watch this?
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.240]   Is this okay?
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   And he's like, yeah, that's fine.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.440]   So I stand up.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.240]   Further, not how I saw this thing going.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.960]   It is, I will save you the details,
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.440]   but let's just say it is a scarring experience.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.300]   So I'm seeing this whole thing happen
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.600]   as they're cutting open and they're finally pulling the baby
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.540]   and I'm like, man, this is not how I thought
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.680]   this was gonna go down.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.680]   The doctor brings the baby over.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.760]   They finally, they get him out.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.580]   His name's Crew.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.960]   They bring him over, brings him in front of my wife and I,
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.960]   behind the sheet.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.560]   And my first thought, I was like,
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.400]   oh, I don't know whose baby that is,
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.280]   but that does not look like my baby.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.120]   That thing is dark.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.960]   This guy is extra Caucasian.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.440]   I'm not sure that that is my baby.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.360]   And what happened was he's just like blue and purple
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.560]   'cause he oxygen and he's getting used to the air.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.780]   And I'm like, oh, that's what's going on.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.440]   Did not see that going that way.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.200]   And then they take it.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.440]   And for whatever reason, I thought like,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.000]   oh, then they give it to you in your arms
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.840]   and you just hold the baby.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.660]   No, they're like, all right,
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.500]   we gotta get this thing over here.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.320]   They're cleaning up.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.560]   They're slapping its back.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.640]   They're trying to get all these different fluids out of it.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.040]   They're like testing him for all these different bodily,
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.840]   either fluids or just different body tests
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.680]   that they have to do.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.140]   And you're just kind of sitting there watching like,
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.160]   oh, I thought it was gonna, you know,
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.280]   get to hold the baby and let me take a selfie.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.920]   And that's not what happens at all.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.760]   They're kind of separated.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.160]   And then finally you get to a point
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.040]   where you get to hold your son
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.200]   and you're taken away with your wife into your next room.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.960]   And it was one of those experiences
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.400]   where just throughout every turn,
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.480]   it seemed like, man, that is not how I saw this thing going.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.240]   And the reason I start there is because really,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.120]   life is just like that experience.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.300]   Where life, you could say, is a series of moments,
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.440]   a series of experiences in your life, in my life,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.480]   in anyone's life, where you find yourself going,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.960]   man, this is not how I saw this thing going.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.800]   There were some plans.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.260]   There was like a vision that I had
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.340]   for how my dating life was going to go,
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.440]   how my relationship life was going to go,
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.700]   when I would be married by,
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.320]   how many children that I would have,
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.340]   what type of job I would have,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.920]   how fastly I would progress up the corporate ladder,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.780]   if you will, how fast I would be able to buy a home.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.880]   All these different successions in life
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.160]   where many times for most of us at some point,
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.480]   we discover that life is full of those moments of going,
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.040]   this is not how I saw this thing going.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.040]   And a lot of people turn to different things
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.400]   in those moments where they realize like,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.780]   oh man, I'm not gonna be married
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.000]   by the time I thought I was.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.680]   I'm not gonna have two kids and a white picket house,
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.360]   white picket fence at a house by the time
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.200]   that I thought I was.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.480]   I'm not going to drive that car that I thought,
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.960]   I didn't get into the college that I thought I would.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.080]   I haven't graduated by the time I thought I would.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.920]   And a lot of people turn to,
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.720]   I mean, really, it's no surprise.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   This leads all kinds of people to turn to alcohol,
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.500]   turn to substances, turn to just like freaking out,
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.880]   like man, life is falling apart,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.960]   I'm gonna take the wheel, I'm freaking out.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.920]   It turns to, I don't know how it expresses itself for you.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.580]   Maybe for you it's anger.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.640]   But what do you do in those moments
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.360]   where you find yourself going, man, maybe it's despair.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.760]   That's probably one of the more common ones is,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.120]   this is not how I saw this thing going.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.740]   God, what are you doing?
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.200]   Further, it's relevant because we as a country
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.860]   find ourselves in a situation where I think most Americans
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.780]   and probably most of us in this room would say,
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.620]   man, in terms of this election and the next national leader,
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.140]   this is not how I saw this thing going.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.320]   And yet here we are.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.560]   And so what I wanna do for the next few minutes
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.260]   is really go to a story in the Old Testament
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.060]   that I think will give us the prescription
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.780]   or the remedy for God's people.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.660]   If you're a follower of Christ in this room,
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.060]   that God says all of us have been invited into,
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.200]   that all of us are to do in those moments
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.340]   where we find ourselves going, God, where are you right now?
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.740]   What are you doing right now?
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.720]   This is not going how I thought it would be going.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.900]   My parents are getting a divorce after 20 years.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.740]   I just found out that someone close to me has cancer.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.900]   God, where are you going with this?
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.380]   And what are we gonna do in those moments?
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.160]   And I think that the story we'll explore tonight
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.060]   will not only give you and I the individual answer,
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.940]   but the answer for the broader nation
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.140]   and specifically Christians everywhere
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.200]   on what we are to do in those moments of life
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.660]   where we find ourselves going,
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.300]   where are you going with this, God?
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.260]   So we're gonna be in the story of Joshua
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.300]   and specifically when Joshua crossed over the Jordan River.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.460]   When he took the nation of Israel,
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.720]   this was a defining moment in Israel's history.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.640]   So we're gonna be in Joshua chapters really one through five.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.740]   I'm gonna summarize and really tell the story
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.420]   and you can go back and read it yourself
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.660]   as you get time this week
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.020]   if you wanna go through the story of Joshua.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.820]   We're gonna explore this defining moment
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.940]   in the nation of Israel's history
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.720]   where they were in circumstances
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.700]   where the country was going,
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.760]   this is not how I saw this thing going.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.300]   And coincidentally, it was also one of those moments
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.040]   where they had passed the baton
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.300]   from one leader of the nation, their president, if you will,
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.400]   to the next president in the midst of this defining moment.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.420]   So here's what's going on.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.700]   So I'll tell kind of the scene
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.020]   and then we'll dive in in chapter three
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.740]   and read some of the verses of what's going on.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.020]   But the nation of Israel has been set up.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.900]   The nation of Israel is really with the Old Testament,
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.000]   the first half of the Bible,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.500]   all about the people of Israel,
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.340]   nation of Israel, God's people.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.020]   God comes to a man named Abraham and Genesis says,
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.900]   I'm gonna make you a great nation
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.380]   and I'm gonna give you land.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.920]   It's gonna be an awesome country.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.620]   It's gonna be called the promised land.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.860]   It's your inheritance.
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.740]   Your people are gonna inherit it for years and years.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.020]   Abraham has some kids.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.180]   His kids have kids.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.000]   Time goes on.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.360]   The nation of Israel exists.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.500]   They're slaves in Egypt with no land.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.620]   And they're going, God, where are you going with this?
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.060]   And 500 years go by and the nation of Israel
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.980]   experiences freedom from slavery during that time.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.700]   Moses is leading the nation.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.060]   They are waiting still and waiting and waiting
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.740]   and waiting and waiting for God
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.940]   to give them their inheritance, this promised land.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.940]   And finally, God says, now is the time.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.540]   I'm going to give you the inheritance.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.700]   I'm moving you towards taking the promised land.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.660]   You are going to receive,
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.620]   this people will receive the land from God.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.620]   And he begins to move the people in that direction.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.820]   And then all of a sudden,
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.480]   and then all of a sudden, something happens.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.220]   Moses dies.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.880]   And for you and I, we're like, man, Moses,
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.720]   that's kind of cool.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.760]   I mean, I guess he's dying.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.400]   You know, sorry, man, rest in peace.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.520]   But for them, the nation of Israel,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.520]   Moses is like George Washington.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.800]   It's the only leader they've ever known.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.960]   Moses not only was an incredible leader,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.440]   he was someone that all the people had found comfort
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.320]   in knowing, hey, this man of God who gave us the law,
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.860]   he's our leader, this incredible person.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.400]   Moses was the person who, with the staff,
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.020]   separated the Red Sea and the water parted.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.960]   Moses was the person who not only that,
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.940]   who led the people and through him,
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.880]   God delivered manna or like food from heaven
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.680]   as the people wandered into Israel.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.960]   Moses was the guy who hit a rock
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.440]   and water came bursting out of it
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.320]   when they were looking for water.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.360]   That's a hard guy to follow.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.520]   I don't care who you are.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.800]   If the leader before you can hit a rock
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.640]   and make water come out of it, that's Moses.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.680]   And Moses dies.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.400]   And who's gonna come after Moses?
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.120]   Joshua.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.060]   And as they head towards the promised land,
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.560]   God says, Moses, you are not gonna lead the people.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.760]   Joshua, you will lead the people into the promised land.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.520]   And Joshua is also, oddly enough, the name for Jesus
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.280]   or Yeshua, if you've heard that, if you're Jewish.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.240]   Yeshua, Joshua, it's the same name.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.560]   But when they translated the Bible,
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.720]   they were like, hey, there's only one Jesus, okay?
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.160]   So Joshua, we're gonna go with Joshua for you.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.960]   But it's the same Hebrew name.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.620]   And Joshua's appointed to lead the people
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.520]   and all the people are going, Joshua's gonna lead us in?
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.240]   He's gonna be the one that takes us to the promised land?
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.100]   And God says, yes.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.580]   Joshua, take them to the Jordan River
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.540]   where they will cross the river.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.020]   So Joshua begins to lead two million Jewish men and women
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.020]   towards this huge river.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.460]   In fact, I think we have a map of it
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.140]   where he's gonna lead them into,
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.700]   passed over the Jordan River,
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.780]   where you can see right in the middle.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.180]   So everyone in the nation of Israel,
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.460]   they're on the right side of this map,
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.100]   the Jordan River right down the middle,
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.260]   and they're gonna pass over it.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.180]   And all the land on the left side of the map
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.660]   is gonna be theirs.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.980]   And God says, Joshua, I want you to take the people
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.520]   up to the edge of the Jordan River.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.840]   So all the people are going there,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.180]   and that's really where our story's gonna pick up,
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.040]   where God begins to give instructions to Joshua
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.880]   to give the people.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.740]   So we're gonna pick this up in chapter three, verse eight.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.720]   As they're about to enter the promised land,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.500]   they're on the edge of the Jordan River.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.380]   They can see the land that was promised to them,
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.580]   the land that every person in their ancestry
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.000]   has ever longed to see, they can see it.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.600]   And they're looking over this huge rushing river,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.480]   and they can see it.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.820]   But between them and their inheritance stands
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.620]   this one obstacle, this river.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.800]   And so here's what Joshua says.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.240]   Give this command to the priests
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.960]   who carry the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.900]   So that's like the pastors of the day
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.760]   who carried the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.920]   Let me explain what that is.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.120]   Ark of the Covenant was Israel's special,
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.220]   it was like the most valuable thing in Israel.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.920]   It was a box, this wooden box,
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.120]   that inside held these kind of symbolic parts
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.400]   of Israel's past, but essentially,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.680]   all that it was was it was a visible representation
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.320]   of the presence of God.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.760]   That it declared to the nation of Israel,
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.360]   hey, God is with this people.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.100]   This box is the most important thing
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.440]   that we as a people possess.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.720]   And as long as it is with us, God's presence,
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.680]   God has promised that this will symbolically declare
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.480]   and display my presence among the people.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.920]   And so Joshua tells the priests,
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.720]   I want you to go stand in the water with this box.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.920]   And the people have gotta be thinking,
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.760]   Joshua, are you kidding me?
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.200]   It's gonna float away, it's wood.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.280]   It's literally gonna float away.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.920]   This is the most valuable thing that we own.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.200]   This is your first decision.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.020]   We need to impeach this new leader.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.720]   This is the first decision that you're gonna make
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.280]   to lead the people, and here's what happens.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.520]   So the people left their camp to cross,
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.200]   this is verse 14 of chapter three,
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.680]   to cross the Jordan, and the priests
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.440]   who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.940]   went ahead of them.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.020]   It was harvest season, look at this.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.500]   And the Jordan was overflowing in its banks.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.360]   Wait a second.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.040]   We're just told something very significant
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.080]   about what's going on when the people arrive
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.600]   at the banks of the shore of the Jordan River.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.260]   But this wasn't any season of the year.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.600]   It was harvest season, or you probably might say flood season.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.440]   What is a flood season?
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.080]   Flood season is like this two-month period
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.400]   in the Jordan River, just this two months,
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.840]   couple months during the year,
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.560]   where the river expands like never before.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.840]   It begins to overflow with water
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.840]   and begins to travel at a more rapid pace
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.800]   than the rest of the year.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.960]   In fact, here's kind of a picture
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.840]   of the Jordan River today in parts of it
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.120]   where it's overflowing with water.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.560]   Significantly different than non-flooding season.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.040]   So God says, I want you to bring the people
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.640]   to the river's edge during the flooding season,
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.600]   when the river and the water is rushing over,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.900]   impossible to pass.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.900]   I mean, scholars tell us and studies tell us
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.880]   that the non-flooding season,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.540]   the distance of the width of the river
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.640]   is like 50 feet wide during the flooding season
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.960]   where the water would come down from the Sea of Galilee,
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.120]   it would go as far as half a mile wide and 150 feet deep
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.960]   and move as fast a pace of 10 miles an hour as you just saw.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.600]   And the people of Israel come up to the water's edge
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.520]   where God has told them, I mean, think about it.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.680]   Why would God, why would you bring them here at this time?
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.320]   Even wandering in the desert 40 years,
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.120]   if you would have come a month later
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.680]   or a couple months earlier,
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.440]   you're gonna miss this whole flooding season, God.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.520]   We could have easily passed.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.640]   Why would you bring us in the worst of the worst times?
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.280]   Why would you command us, God, to come here?
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.100]   What is he doing?
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.260]   What is he trying to communicate?
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.460]   And so all of a sudden, the people are there,
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.800]   they're watching what's gonna happen,
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.080]   and the priests begin to approach the water.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.480]   And you gotta think, Joshua's nervous 'cause he's like,
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.860]   man, I hope that was the Lord and not El Diablo.
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.320]   I don't know who gave me that command,
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.860]   but please, something happen as the priests begin to take
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.280]   the most valuable thing that they have,
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.240]   the presence of God, this wooden box that communicated,
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.240]   I'm with you, and put it in harm's way inside of the river.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.840]   But here's what happens.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.040]   But as soon as the feet of the priests, this is verse 15,
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.580]   who were carrying the ark touched the water
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.280]   at the river's edge, the water at that point began backing
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.140]   up a great distance away at a town called Adam,
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.600]   which is near Zarethan.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.960]   We don't know where Adam is.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.980]   This is the only mention of the town of Adam in the Bible.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.440]   The reason we know where it is, I'm sorry,
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.600]   is because of Zarethan.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   But had it not been marked by, oh, it's the town by Zarethan,
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.080]   we wouldn't know, it's the only time it's mentioned.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.280]   And the water below that point flowed on into the Dead Sea
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.060]   until the riverbed was dry.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.680]   Here's what this means, that in this moment,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.440]   Joshua says, hey, guys, slowly start to creep out
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.300]   into the water, take a few steps, and this doesn't,
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.160]   all of a sudden, something begins to happen to the water.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.000]   And if you know this story, you may have heard
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.320]   that it's like the Red Sea, where Moses goes,
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.000]   all of a sudden, two walls of water.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.720]   That's not what happens here.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.140]   They take a step out, and it says 20 miles away,
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.760]   which is where Zarethan was.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.360]   All of a sudden, the water stops.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.040]   And so Joshua is sitting there with the people
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.360]   as they watch.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.040]   I think the water's beginning to go down a little bit,
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.160]   because all of a sudden, it stopped 20 miles away,
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.240]   and so it's just gonna continue rushing away.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.200]   And they watch as the waters flow,
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.240]   almost like letting a bathtub out of water,
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.800]   as it slowly begins to drain out,
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.960]   and slowly, they begin to see, oh, man,
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.000]   this water is going away.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.640]   Scholars have estimated that it would have taken
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.640]   almost two hours to sit there as they watched
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.240]   the water go away, and they watched the power of God
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.120]   show up when this Ark of the Covenant was in their midst,
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.640]   was placed in the middle of this obstacle
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640]   in the Jordan River.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:18.760]   But even if you're Joshua, I mean, another occasion
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.120]   where you've gotta be thinking, man,
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.240]   this is not how I saw this thing going,
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.800]   but God was going to show up for his people.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.320]   Here's what happens.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.040]   Eventually, all of the water goes out
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.440]   until the waterbed is dry.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.000]   Then all the people, two million people,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.240]   cross over near the town of Jericho.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.000]   Meanwhile, the priests, who were carrying the Ark
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.120]   of the Lord's Covenant, stood on dry ground
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.680]   in the middle of the riverbed.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.760]   As the people passed by, they waited there
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.360]   until the whole nation had crossed over the Jordan
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.400]   on dry ground.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   Two million people walk past this Ark of the Covenant,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.480]   these pastors standing in the middle of the water,
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.080]   holding this wooden box, and two million people
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.480]   walk past as the water ceases.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.120]   The overflowing, rushing water, that was the Jordan River.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.760]   As it ceases, it is completely dry in this one space,
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.000]   and the people pass over.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.640]   As soon as they get to the other side,
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.800]   verse 18 of chapter four, it says this,
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.520]   that the priests carrying the Ark of the Lord's Covenant
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.600]   came up out of the riverbed, and as soon as their feet
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.920]   were on high ground, the water of the Jordan
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.360]   returned and overflowed its banks.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.120]   Joshua, while they were walking through,
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.880]   the Bible tells us, I want you to pick up 12 stones,
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.200]   and I want each one, each person that had
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.720]   these different 12 tribes, he says, hey, look,
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.800]   I want everybody from each tribe to grab a stone,
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.580]   12 big stones, take the stones,
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.720]   take 'em outside of the river,
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.160]   and here's why I want you to do that,
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.540]   because there's gonna come a day,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.800]   and I want you to stack 'em and make this memorial,
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.240]   because there's gonna come a day
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.080]   where people are gonna not remember this,
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.720]   and when your children ask, it tells us in chapter four,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.040]   when your children ask you, why are those stones here?
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.360]   I want you to tell them of what God did here,
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.520]   where he separated the waters,
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.260]   where you saw the Jordan stopped,
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.640]   and I want you to tell them that God can be trusted.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.320]   I want you to pass it on to your children
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.220]   and set up a memorial inside of there.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.520]   But as soon as this wooden box,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.700]   the presence of the Lord comes out of the water,
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.920]   the water all of a sudden comes rushing back in.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:32.920]   During chapter five, Joshua, who's further being introduced
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.760]   as his first acts of leadership, man,
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.080]   the God who we worship, the God of this box,
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.860]   the God of this people, the God of the whole earth,
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:40.760]   can be trusted.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.760]   He's now in the promised land with his people.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.240]   They're stepping on the land that was promised
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.080]   to their ancestors for hundreds of years,
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.380]   and now Joshua goes out to scout some of the land,
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.100]   and while he's out scouting the land,
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.360]   he further encounters why and who he can trust
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.280]   as their God.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.120]   Here's what happens.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.100]   He's out walking around the town.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.520]   This happens in chapter five, where Joshua says this.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.600]   When Joshua was near the town of Jericho,
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.440]   he looked up, so Joshua, all the people, they make camp.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.560]   They got all the camels, all the donkeys, all the tents,
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.680]   everything across the riverbed, they make camp.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.840]   Joshua's gonna go out, kinda scout stuff up,
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.360]   and all of a sudden, he goes out scouting,
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.560]   and here's what he sees.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:20.520]   He looked up, and he saw a man standing in front of him
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.880]   with his sword drawn in hand, and he went up to him,
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.200]   and he said, "Are you friend or are you foe?"
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.520]   So there's a man standing there with his sword drawn out,
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.780]   and he says, "Neither one.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.220]   "I am the commander of the Lord's army."
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.040]   As I'm like, hey, you're asking whose side I'm on,
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   your side or their side?
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.440]   I'm on neither side.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.600]   I didn't come to take sides.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.560]   I came to take over, and I'm the commander of your army.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.360]   I'm the commander of all things.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.840]   That's who I am, and he's introduced to God in the flesh.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.240]   Many scholars, Martin Luther,
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.440]   there's lots of famous people who say,
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.440]   "This is actually Jesus, the later Yeshua,
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.820]   "the later Joshua, standing eyeball to eyeball
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.100]   "with Joshua, saying, 'I'm the one
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.540]   "'who's ultimately in charge of all of these people,
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.660]   "'of all things.
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.500]   "'That's who I am.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.600]   "'You're asking me to take sides?
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.840]   "'I didn't come to take sides.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.040]   "'I'm here to take over, because all things are mine.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.400]   "'I'm the one ultimately in charge of these people,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   "'of all people.'"
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:24.260]   Why did I choose the story of Joshua?
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.960]   As we close out this series,
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.800]   what I think more than anything this story portrays
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.340]   is the idea that God can be trusted,
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.240]   that he can be trusted.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.400]   I mean, think about it.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.560]   Why would you bring them, God, to the water's edge
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.920]   in the worst of the worst time?
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.720]   I mean, it's flooding.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.480]   There's water overflowing the banks.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.300]   They can't get through.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.640]   This is the worst time they could possibly come, God.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.820]   Had they come during non-flooding season,
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.080]   they could have walked across.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.480]   They could have at least tried to get the camels
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.640]   and the donkeys across.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.120]   They could have waded through the water.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.960]   You bring them when it's overflowing,
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.360]   when the water's rushing everywhere.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.400]   This is not how they saw this thing going.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.880]   Why would you bring them then?
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.680]   They're your people who you love,
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.720]   because he wanted to show the nation of Israel
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.160]   that God can be trusted.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.040]   And I don't want you to put your trust, Israel, David, you,
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.320]   and Joshua, and Moses,
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.480]   and your own ability to cross over
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.680]   whatever is in front of you,
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.920]   whatever trouble you're facing,
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.220]   I do not want you to put your trust in yourself.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.880]   I want you to put it in me, your God.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.120]   I can be trusted.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.400]   That's the one idea from this entire text
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.000]   is that God is a God who can be trusted.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.680]   And in the midst of, the reason why he allows
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.600]   even crazy candidates to come to the surface
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.240]   is the same reason why he says,
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.840]   "I'm gonna bring you in the midst of the flood
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.220]   "to show you there is a God who is alive
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.520]   "and will work in the midst of my people
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.140]   "in incredible ways if they will trust him."
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.180]   And the message of Joshua,
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.760]   and the message that Israel was introduced to
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.940]   was that, man, our confidence was never in Moses.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.100]   Our confidence was never in Joshua.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.960]   Our confidence is never in a man.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.980]   It's in you alone, God.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.820]   You're our delivery.
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.760]   You're the one who saves.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.240]   You're the one that can be trusted,
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.900]   the only one that can be trusted.
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.080]   In the same way it's true today,
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.920]   in the midst of crazy circumstances around you and me,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.120]   he's inviting all of us that I can be trusted.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.880]   I don't know what you're walking through in the room.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.640]   I know that all of us are walking through
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.140]   like kind of a crazy political season,
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:36.980]   but here's what else I know.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.320]   I know that inside of this room,
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.220]   there's a lot more than that going on.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.820]   There's divorce going on.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:49.040]   There's shame and pain from past sexual abuse going on.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.240]   There's challenges at work.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.640]   There's challenges of unemployment.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.660]   There's challenges of dating relationships,
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.000]   challenges of just trying to figure out
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.240]   how I can make ends meet.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.020]   And in the midst of all of that, God is saying,
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.920]   "Hey, I'm inviting you, if you are a follower of Jesus,
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.000]   "if you are a part of my people, that I can be trusted."
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.460]   As you look, do not be dismayed like the rest of the world
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.260]   as to what the election's gonna hold
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.600]   or to what the future of America's gonna hold.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.080]   Look to me.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.920]   I can be trusted.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.520]   Remember that God can be trusted.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:29.200]   It's easy to see when someone actually believes this,
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.120]   like there's something distinct about someone
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.560]   when they actually think, "Oh man, God,
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.860]   "no matter what comes my way,
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.240]   "I can actually trust God's in control."
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.680]   If this relationship ends, I know I can trust God.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   I know he's got something else going on.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.160]   When you introduce to these people,
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.140]   when you meet these people and they're like,
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.320]   "Yeah, I lost my job, but you know what?
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.800]   "I trust God is at work.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.980]   "I don't know what that's gonna mean,
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.080]   "and it may not mean that I have another job anytime soon.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.520]   "It may mean that I have a worse job,
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.200]   "but I trust God and he's at work.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.660]   "The dating relationship I thought was gonna go
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.680]   "another direction, it didn't end up going there,
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.720]   "but I trust God."
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.680]   And that's one experience, one type of person.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.240]   Then there's an entirely other person
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.560]   walking through the exact same circumstances
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.600]   where all of a sudden we're like,
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.360]   "Oh my gosh, this relationship ended.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.580]   "My life is over.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.160]   "I'm gonna be the cat lady forever.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.000]   "I cannot believe it.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.620]   "We had a song, we had a cat,
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.000]   "and all of a sudden we're done,"
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.160]   and they begin freaking out.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.120]   This job, I cannot believe it.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.880]   I wanna ruin this employer.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.800]   There's two different responses that come out
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.880]   of the person who trusts God
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.080]   despite the fact they're walking
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.760]   through the exact same circumstances.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.040]   The one difference is one trusts that God's at work,
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.120]   and the other's not so sure.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.360]   It's not dissimilar to like,
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.160]   there's really two types of people in this room
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.120]   as it relates to roller coasters.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.480]   Anyone like roller coasters in here?
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.320]   There's two types of people.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.200]   There's one type of person who's like,
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   "Oh man, I hate roller coasters,
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.500]   "and there's no chance that I'm gonna trust
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.800]   "that 12-year-old kid flipping the switch over here
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.960]   "as I go up in the air."
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.080]   And then there's the other person who's like,
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:01.960]   "Oh man, it's awesome.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.000]   "The engineering is great.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.840]   "I love this.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.560]   "Hands up in the air, woo, can't do anything.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.440]   "It's not gonna hurt me, this is great.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.600]   "Our team recently went to the fair,
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.380]   "and we have this tradition on our team
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.860]   "where we will go on the ship every year,
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.920]   "and I won't name names,
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.600]   "but there's one person on our team
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.500]   "who was terrified of the ship, Elena,
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.180]   "and Elena was, we're getting on the ship,
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.440]   "and all of a sudden we're gonna ride the ship,"
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.480]   and she's like, "No, there's no way."
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.460]   I'm like, "It's the most tame.
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.800]   "Look, there's a nine-year-old
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.280]   "in front of us on this thing."
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.680]   She's like, "No, oh my gosh, I can't.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.240]   "I'm so terrified of what's gonna happen."
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.800]   Here's the difference between her
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.540]   and the person she's sitting next to on that ship
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.380]   or on that ride.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.860]   One trusts the ride, and one doesn't.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.520]   And because the person who loves the ride
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.260]   or not loves the ride, trusts the ride,
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.580]   they're able to go, "Man, I don't know
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.300]   "what's gonna happen next, but I trust it.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.360]   "I'm okay," versus the person on the roller coaster
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.840]   who doesn't trust the engineer behind the ride,
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.840]   or doesn't trust it, and is grabbing on
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.520]   to anything that it can for control.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.480]   In the same way, you see it reflected
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.920]   in behavior of people who go,
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.540]   "Man, I trust the person behind the ride.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.940]   "I trust God's at work in this circumstance.
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.300]   "I trust him with what's going on right now,
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.580]   "right here, in this election, in my life,
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.920]   "with my roommate that just moved out,
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.200]   "with what's gonna happen next."
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.100]   And then there's the person who says,
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.360]   "No, I don't trust the ride."
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.000]   And they're grabbing on to anything they can
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.740]   to allow them to feel in control.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.260]   And God's inviting, and he invited the nation of Israel,
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.600]   "I'm bringing you when the floodwaters are there.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.080]   "Because my question for you is,
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.560]   "when you look into the water,
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.040]   "when you look into the floods as they rise,
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.060]   "who are you gonna trust in, Israel?
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:48.280]   "Me or yourself, and you're gonna turn back."
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.840]   And he's invited you, and he's invited me
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.560]   in the midst of every circumstance in life.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.480]   That's the message he's trying to get to you,
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.780]   is that I can be trusted with what you're walking through.
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.120]   And I don't know about you,
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.120]   but especially in a season like this,
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.440]   that's the message my heart needs to hear.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.560]   That's the message I think the church needs to hear,
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.520]   is that we, above all other people,
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.240]   in the midst of, man, uncertainty,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.600]   political uncertainty, whatever's ahead,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.120]   our God is in the heavens, and he is in control.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.080]   Whoever is elected tonight has been placed there
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.720]   and appointed by God.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.960]   Does that mean that they're like,
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.360]   they've won the most favor with God?
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.100]   No, it means that he said, "In my divine,
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.320]   "my sovereign, or my power, all-powerful purpose,
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.900]   "I'm putting this person there.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.360]   "And I'm not surprised that I'm in control,
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.380]   "just like I was with the nation of Israel."
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.760]   And just like, ultimately, what Joshua found out
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.740]   from being introduced to God in the flesh, Jesus,
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.500]   as he stood there in chapter five,
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.800]   and he got down on one knee and bowed before him
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.000]   because he was told that,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.080]   you're standing on holy ground, Moses.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.160]   I'm sorry, Joshua.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.460]   And I'm the one who's in command of this country.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.440]   I'm the one who's in command of this army.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.940]   I'm the one who's in command.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.480]   In the same way, as it relates to the election of Rhine-West,
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.100]   not only can God be trusted,
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.840]   but he can be trusted because he's in control,
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.040]   and he's the one who's ultimately in command.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.480]   And so because of that, what I'm gonna do
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.240]   is I'm gonna have the band come up,
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.520]   and we are going to pause, and we are going to,
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.320]   and I'm gonna ask you to stay seated,
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.480]   and stay here, and we are gonna do something
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.720]   we've never done at The Porch before.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.120]   We are going to sit where we are
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.280]   and pray for the candidates and pray for our country,
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.780]   and we are gonna storm the gates of heaven
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.320]   with the prayers of the saints.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.760]   We're gonna pray for Donald Trump,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.080]   we're gonna pray for Hillary Clinton,
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.800]   and I'll lead us through that individually
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.280]   right where you are.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.240]   By name, I'm asking,
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.420]   I want you to turn your attention to God and pray for them.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.800]   The band will play softly behind,
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.560]   and we'll give a chance for 45 seconds,
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.600]   maybe a minute for each of you to pray for Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:12.280]   Pray for her family, pray for her if she is our future leader.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.140]   If half of the things that the media says are true,
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.320]   here's what I know about her.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.880]   She is hurting, she is sad, and she needs the grace of God.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.260]   And so now the church has an opportunity
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.700]   to do what it always does with any person on this planet,
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.820]   because all of us are broken, and turn and say,
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.180]   God, will you step in and save this woman?
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.580]   Will you do miraculous things in her life?
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.220]   I mean, if she becomes our next president
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.980]   or whatever she does, Lord, I know that she's passionate
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.880]   about advancing the stages in which you can do abortion,
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.720]   full-term abortion.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.820]   She's like, yes, let's do it.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.120]   God, will you make her,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.960]   you are the God who can do all things.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.120]   Will you make her the most passionate, outspoken advocate
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.320]   for shutting down abortion in our lifetime?
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.360]   Because you're the God who does those kinds of things.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.600]   You're the God who takes Saul's and turns them into Paul's.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.000]   Will you do that now?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.880]   Will you stretch out your hand and will you save her?
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.400]   And if she's our next president, Lord,
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.560]   would she rule out of an overflow of being ruled by you?
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.480]   We're gonna pray now for Hillary,
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.040]   right where you are, for Hillary.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.080]   And then in 45 seconds, I'm gonna come back
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.440]   and we'll move into Donald.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.580]   (gentle music)
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.000]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.420]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.840]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.260]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.680]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.100]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.520]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.940]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.360]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.780]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:32:16.020]   All right, where we are.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.220]   I'm gonna move and let's pray for Donald Trump.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.860]   Pray that God would step into his life,
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.420]   that he would save him
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.220]   if he doesn't have a relationship with Jesus,
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.500]   that he would become the most passionate advocate
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.340]   of women and their rights that there ever has been.
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.100]   For the rest of his days, he would spend his life
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.380]   putting the name of Jesus on the towers
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.460]   of the hearts of men.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.740]   That's what God does.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.820]   He's done it every week here at the porch,
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.780]   or he does it every week.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.380]   He does it in Houston.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.460]   He does it in the woodlands.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.980]   He does it in Fort Worth.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.620]   He does it all over the place
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.060]   where the people of God, the saints say,
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.780]   he can be trusted.
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.260]   And we're gonna step out in faith.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.620]   We're gonna trust you, God.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.340]   So let's pray for Donald Trump.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.920]   (gentle music)
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.340]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.760]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.180]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.600]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.020]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.440]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.860]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.740]   We're gonna have a chance to pray for our country.
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.060]   There's a lot of anger.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.260]   There's gonna be a lot of division,
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.020]   regardless of what happens afterwards.
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.740]   And the church offers the best solution
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.140]   of unity, of love, of hope.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.580]   So pray for our country,
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.220]   and specifically pray for the strength
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.040]   of the church in our country,
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.380]   that God would awaken dead churches,
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.980]   awaken the parts of this church member's heart
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.140]   that are dead and your heart that are dead.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.820]   A friend on our staff said today
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.820]   that if the nation is led astray,
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.980]   it won't be because if it was ever elected today,
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.420]   it will be because the church ceases to be the church.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.860]   So let's pray for the church in our country,
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.780]   for our country.
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:42.320]   (gentle music)
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:47.740]   (gentle music continues)
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:53.160]   (gentle music continues)
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.580]   (gentle music continues)
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:04.000]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.920]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:19.980]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:23.400]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:32.620]   Father, just like Joshua stood before you
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.340]   and he bowed before you,
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.780]   he bowed his head before you.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.700]   He acknowledged that you're the God over all things.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.340]   We come before you now,
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.780]   and we storm the gates of heaven,
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:48.140]   and we ask that you would save these two men and women
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.700]   if they do not know you,
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.020]   and if they do know you,
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.220]   would they have a deep, abiding,
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.980]   overflowing relationship with you
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.700]   that leads them to rule,
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.840]   marked with the characteristic of love
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.780]   that the ultimate ruler, Jesus, our Savior,
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.980]   rules with.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.720]   Father, we pray for the church ahead.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.140]   Would you strengthen the church?
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.940]   Pray for the future of the church,
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.860]   for the faces of the men and women in this room,
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.780]   in the room in Fort Worth,
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.660]   in the room in the Woodlands,
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.780]   in the room in Houston.
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.420]   God, would you strengthen your church
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.980]   through my friends here,
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.920]   through me here?
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.220]   Father, would the biggest and best ideas of the church
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.140]   be from this room,
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.220]   from those rooms,
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.620]   from the body of Christ?
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.660]   Would they courageously step out in faith and say,
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.100]   "We're gonna trust the God who is there.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.700]   "He can be trusted.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.780]   "He will make a way."
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.160]   Would you pour unbelievable amounts of resources
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.660]   into the hands of my friends here?
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.180]   And would they radically and generously
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.680]   steward them for your kingdom?
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.740]   Would they be bold in their faith
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.660]   and bold and courageous?
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.340]   And would you do the same in my heart, God?
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.060]   Forgive me, forgive my friends,
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.180]   for the parts of us
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.440]   that have not been disciplined in praying,
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.940]   for men and women who are slandered every day on TV,
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.980]   running for an office,
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.980]   who we do not know,
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.660]   who we've made judgments about.
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.480]   Father, would you,
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.060]   through the hounds of heaven,
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.660]   pursue and save these people?
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.380]   You saved Saul and you turned him into Paul.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.820]   You saved Peter the coward
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.120]   and you turned him into Peter the courageous.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.040]   Would you do this now?
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.460]   Father, help us to be strong.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.300]   Whatever you have ahead,
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.740]   we love you and we trust you.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.420]   We will not fear the terror of the night,
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.260]   as you say in Psalm 91,
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.180]   because you are our refuge and our fortress,
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.420]   the God in whom we trust.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.860]   And we will dwell in the shelter of the Most High
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.860]   and abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.140]   Whatever's ahead, Lord,
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.580]   make us strong and courageous like you did with Joshua.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.140]   May we trust in what you said
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.260]   and what you quoted in the book of Hebrews from Joshua.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.980]   The fear not, for I will never leave you, my people.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.540]   I will never forsake you.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.940]   And I've already gone before you by that presence of God.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.900]   I am with you in the middle of the flood
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.140]   through the presence of God.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.660]   And I'm behind you in whatever flood we face.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.420]   May you're with us in nearness.
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.380]   Amen.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.780]   I'll close, and then we're gonna close in song.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:25.100]   Ultimately, man, this story tells us why God can be trusted.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:32.580]   Because it points in every detail to another story.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.380]   Like, think about it.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:40.380]   A man named Jesus shows up to the people of God
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:44.780]   and he takes the baton from Moses, the law,
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.140]   and he takes the people
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.460]   who are awaiting to go into the inheritance,
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.340]   but they cannot cross this barrier,
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.980]   and he takes the people of God,
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.660]   and what the law could not do with Moses,
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.380]   takes the baton and through a piece of wood,
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.500]   this wooden arc, he allows the people of God
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.580]   to enter into their inheritance,
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.900]   their promised inheritance from God.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.180]   A man named Jesus shows up and through a piece of wood,
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.180]   that's an arc, similar to a man named Jesus
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.580]   who through a piece of wood,
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.820]   just like the arc of the covenant
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.100]   that displayed the covenant of God for his people.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.460]   So the cross of the covenant
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.900]   that displayed the covenantal love of God for his people,
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.540]   a man named Jesus shows up through a piece of wood,
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.980]   allows the people of God to cross over the barrier
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.300]   they could not do without him through a piece of wood.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.220]   And he cuts off the water
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.380]   all the way back to a town called Adam.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.940]   He cuts off the problem,
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.100]   the barrier is cut all the way back
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.980]   to the place where it began, Adam.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.020]   It's all over, every detail in the page,
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.740]   the story points to Jesus.
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.300]   It points to the ultimate reason
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.020]   why no matter what we're walking through,
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.060]   no matter what you're walking through,
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.220]   he can be trusted
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.540]   because it was perfectly displayed on that cross.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.540]   What do I mean by that?
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.020]   The God who showed up and said, "Can you trust me?
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.780]   "I'm the God who loves you so much.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:10.140]   "I will enter into my own creation and die for you."
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.020]   So that by a piece of wood,
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.900]   a man named Jesus could allow the people of God
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.660]   to enter into a place that without him,
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.740]   they could not enter.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.380]   It points to him in every detail,
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.420]   even the town of Adam,
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.340]   even taking what the law could not do.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.900]   And it points to the ultimate story of life,
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.740]   the ultimate reason that you're alive,
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:39.620]   the ultimate place that meaning is found in life,
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.980]   the ultimate reason why every circumstance
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.140]   that will exist on this planet,
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.340]   listen to me very clearly,
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.660]   everything you're gonna go through
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.260]   is God's screaming attempt to get you to look at Jesus.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.740]   Right now, inside of our country,
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.620]   the craziness that is the election
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.540]   is God in his mercy saying,
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.300]   "I need you to look for a savior,
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.700]   "and I'm pretty sure you're not gonna look
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.900]   "to the White House.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.300]   "Will you look at my son,
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.060]   "the one who made a way when there was no way
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.940]   "so that all people could cross over the barrier,"
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.340]   separating them from that promised land.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:12.860]   And it points to him, to the God who can be trusted.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.900]   And tonight, as much as any time,
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:15.780]   I don't know about you,
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.180]   but what I need more than anything
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.820]   is not to be concerned about looking at who's going what,
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.020]   I need to be concerned and look at Jesus.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.780]   Would he capture more of our attention than ourselves?
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.020]   Would we be more focused on him than ourselves,
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.580]   more focused on him than whoever wins tonight?
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.340]   Because he's already won,
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.020]   and in Christ, we've already won.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.180]   Let me pray that that would be the case,
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.820]   and we're gonna sing in song.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.820]   Father, we thank you.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.340]   You have already won.
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.940]   We worship you now in song.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.140]   God, strengthen your church,
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.980]   and do so through my friends in this room.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.540]   Thank you for Jesus, the ultimate Savior,
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.100]   who made a way when there was no way.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.380]   We trust you, Jesus, with everything.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.500]   We trust you.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.420]   Would you help us to trust you more?
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.820]   Would you help that to be true?
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.660]   Amen.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:11.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
