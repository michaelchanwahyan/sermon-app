 [Music]

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Porch, how we doing?

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 [Cheering]

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Come on, come on.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 I am so excited.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I am sincerely so excited

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 to be with you guys tonight.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 This message, this scripture,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 has really ministered to me.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Even in preparing it for you

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 and preparing it for this evening

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 has really ministered to me.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Let me just start with asking this question.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Have you guys ever had to carry a bunch of chairs?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Have you ever done that?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 If you've been to the launch retreat with us,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 we put out a thousand chairs,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 we've got to collect a thousand chairs.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 You're loading them up, the folding chairs,

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 and you're carrying them in a cart.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 What that means is people spread out and they're helping.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 You've seen the scene where you're folding up the chairs

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 and you're carrying them.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Everyone carries, if you've ever noticed,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 everyone carries different amounts of chairs.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Right?

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 My ten-year-old daughter,

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 she's got her and David Marvin,

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 they each have one in each hand.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Then you've got Blake McJunkin,

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 like big Blake.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 He's carrying 27 chairs

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 and just kind of walking up effortlessly

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 and like setting them down.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Everybody has different stacks.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 They carry them different ways.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 They can carry different amounts of chairs.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Every now and then,

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 someone will drop them.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Those aluminum chairs on that concrete floor,

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 it's loud.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 It makes this loud noise,

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 this big commotion.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 The only reason

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 anyone would ever drop the chairs

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 is because they carried more

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 than they were supposed to.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 They thought they could carry this many,

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 but they didn't have a grip.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 One slips out

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 and it just makes this big commotion.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Everybody turns around, stops,

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 "What's going on over there?

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Oh, so-and-so dropped the chairs again."

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I start there

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 because it's been an interesting season for me.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I just want to let you in

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 in my world a little bit.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I metaphorically

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 and metaphorically

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 speaking, I think I carried more chairs

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 than I was supposed to

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 this summer.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I had a friend

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 really close to me, someone I love,

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 got sick

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 and I started

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 stepping into their life

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 and helping them and visiting doctors

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 with them and going to appointments

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 with them and

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 really bearing

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 that burden with them.

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 I didn't realize how much

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 stressful and how difficult it was.

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 In the midst of speaking

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 engagements, I taught at several

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 different camps and was traveling this summer.

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Summers are really busy speaking time.

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I was scheduled

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 to teach 25 times

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 in six weeks.

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 That was kind of going on.

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I signed a book deal.

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I'm writing a book

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 to you guys, really. It's called "Welcome to Adulting."

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 There were deadlines.

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 The deadlines were

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 kind of hanging over me.

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I picked up another chair

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 and I picked up another chair

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 and I picked up another chair.

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I didn't realize how many I had.

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 I went down to Austin

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 and I taught at a big church in Austin.

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Great opportunities.

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 I loved to teach the Word of God.

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I loved to share the gospel.

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I went down there and taught three times,

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 back to back to back.

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I was on the road. I was driving back to Dallas

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 in a large church on the West Coast called

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 one of the largest churches in the world,

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Rick Warren's church, if you know about it.

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I said, "Hey, can you come and speak here

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 next Sunday, next weekend?"

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I said, "Man, I'd be honored."

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I came home and I taught here.

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I got on a plane and I flew to California.

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I was sitting in my hotel room.

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 I was laying in the hotel bed.

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 It was the night before I was teaching.

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 The next day,

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 it was going to be streamed

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 to 13 campuses,

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 30,000 people.

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I'm laying in bed and I can't sleep.

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I'm like, "Man, why can't I sleep?"

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 I've got to sleep. I've got to teach.

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 I've got to teach tomorrow.

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I'm going to be in front of 30,000 people.

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 They brought in this silly guy from Texas.

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I've got to have my act together.

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Lord, help me sleep.

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 When you try to sleep, you can't sleep.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I'm laying there and I'm like, "Why can't I sleep?"

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I feel my heart just go boom.

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Ba-da-ba-boom.

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Ba-da-ba-boom.

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Something's not right.

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Something's not right with my heart, my physical heart.

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Something's wrong.

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I can't sleep. Something's wrong with my heart.

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I get through the night.

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I go the next day. I teach three times.

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I'm supposed to.

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I get on a plane. I come back to

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Dallas.

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I'm sitting in my house now.

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Ba-da-ba-boom.

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Ba-da-ba-boom.

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Thunder beats in my chest.

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I go to the emergency room.

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 "Hey, guys. Something's not right."

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 They hooked me up to an EKG, all these

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 machines and wires.

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 I said, "Yeah, I see some PVCs."

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I'm like, "What are PVCs?"

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 "Pipes? What are you talking about?"

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 They're like, "No. Premature ventricular contractions."

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 "Oh, man. That doesn't sound good."

152
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 That's just something I've been dealing with.

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Asking the Lord, honestly, to take from me.

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 But in it, I see

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 His extreme mercy.

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I don't believe that

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 all health issues are caused by sin.

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Certainly don't believe that.

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 That's a gross heresy.

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 But as I look at my own,

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I can see a sin

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 attached to it.

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 The sin that is attached to it

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 is the sin of pride.

165
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 It's the pride of a Savior complex,

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 thinking that I'm the only one that can help somebody.

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Moving into their situation,

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 instead of allowing them to lean on their community,

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 it's the sin of

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 finding identity and success

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 and book deals.

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 The sin of wanting

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 people to think much of me

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 and not being able to say no.

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Not wanting to say no because every time you say yes,

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 you're saying no to something.

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I didn't realize that, so I just kept saying yes.

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I kept saying yes, and going here,

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 and flying here, and doing this.

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I'm thinking, "Man, this is all great."

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Before you know it, you start leaning on your own gifts,

182
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 which is a sin.

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Just leaving God out of it and just going,

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 "I do this routine."

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 The sin of routine, where it's like,

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 "I'm going to step up there, I'm going to put a microphone on,

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I'm going to speak, I'm going to open the Word, I'm going to teach,

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I'm going to give this illustration."

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 You're just going through these things.

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 It was the sin of pride.

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Pride is the grossest sin.

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 The mother of all sins.

193
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 In fact, C.S. Lewis

194
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 says this about pride.

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Pride is the...

196
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 He says, "According to

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Christian teachers, the essential vice,

198
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 the utmost evil, is pride.

199
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Unchastity, or being

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 unpure,

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 anger, greed, drunkenness,

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 and all that are mere

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 flea bites in comparison.

204
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 It was through pride that the devil

205
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 became the devil.

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Pride leads to every other vice.

207
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 It is the complete anti-God

208
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 state of mind.

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Pride says that, "I want to be

210
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 like God." Lucifer, in the kingdom of heaven,

211
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 fell from heaven with the fallen angels.

212
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 He says, "God, I don't want to worship you.

213
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I want to be like you." Adam and Eve, in the garden,

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 says, "God, we don't trust you. You say

215
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 that that's not good, but we want to see

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 what it is. We think maybe you're holding goodness

217
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 from us. That's pride."

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It's the biggest

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 struggle in the room

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 today, and it's the biggest struggle

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 of everyone listening

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 this evening.

223
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And I believe pride...

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Pride is the source of your anxiety.

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 If you find

226
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 yourself anxious, I want

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 you to trace it back to pride. I know

228
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 that's not helpful. I know that's not

229
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 helpful. I understand that when I

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 say pride is the source of your anxiety, it doesn't

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 help you be less anxious. But if

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 it's true,

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I think we can find something helpful

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 in that truth, especially in this

235
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 verse we're going to be

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 in. And so we're starting a new series

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 tonight. I know it's the end of the year. This is

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 the series that we will kick the year off. It's called

239
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Vice and Virtue. Vice

240
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 and Virtue, where every week we will look at a

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 vice and a virtue, the menaces and the marks

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 of Christianity.

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And so tonight, the subject is

244
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 pride and humility, the vice and

245
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 the virtue, pride and

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 humility as we dive

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 in on this specific topic.

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And so there's some questions I can ask you to see if you

249
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 struggle with pride.

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Are you anxious?

251
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Are you critical

252
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 of others?

253
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Are you defensive when someone

254
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 points out sin in your life?

255
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Do you justify?

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Explain it away. Do you quickly notice

257
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 pride in others? He's prideful. She's so

258
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 prideful. Do you constantly

259
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 seek out others' approval?

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Are you

261
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 insecure?

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Do you take advantage of

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 God's grace?

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Do you feel

265
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 shame? Or

266
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 think your sin or brokenness is bigger

267
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 than God's grace? Do you believe

268
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 that you are worthless or unforgiven?

269
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 That's prideful. Does a particular

270
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 sin define you

271
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 more than God's claims on your life?

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 I believe this vice, more than

273
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 any other sin, is robbing you of God's

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 favor,

275
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 His blessing,

276
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 His joy,

277
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 and His abundant

278
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 grace.

279
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And if you

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 fall into this sin,

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I'm warning you tonight,

282
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 the chairs you're carrying, they are

283
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 going to come crashing down.

284
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 It is only a matter of time.

285
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 It's only a matter of time

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 before there's a big

287
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 noise and a commotion around

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 you. And at the base

289
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 of it is pride.

290
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 I'm going to be in 1 Peter 5.

291
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 If you want to turn there

292
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 and your Bibles are on your phones,

293
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I want to welcome those tuning in from

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 around the world, especially our friends in Fort Worth

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 this evening, our friends in

296
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Houston, and those that

297
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 are joining the stream online through

298
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 the app. In 1 Peter

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 5, I'll read the Scripture to

300
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 you, and before I do, I want you to know

301
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 this has been a lifeline for me. I don't know that

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 my heart's ever been more around a Scripture that I've

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 taught, because when that happened to me

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 this summer, what I did is I took a dry erase marker

305
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 and I wrote this on my mirror.

306
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 And every morning and every night, I would

307
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 read it to myself, this specific Scripture.

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 This is what it says. "All of you,

309
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 everyone, clothe yourself with humility

310
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 toward one another, because

311
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 God opposes the proud," from the Proverbs.

312
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 "God opposes the proud, but shows

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 favor to the humble. Humble yourselves

314
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 therefore under God's mighty hand,

315
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 that He may lift you up in due time.

316
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Cast all your anxiety on

317
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Him, because He cares for you.

318
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy,

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 the devil, prowls around like a roaring

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 lion, looking for someone to devour.

321
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Resist him, standing

322
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 firm in the faith, because you

323
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 know that the family of believers

324
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 throughout the world is undergoing the same

325
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 kind of sufferings.

326
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And the God of all grace, who called you to

327
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 His eternal glory in Christ, after you

328
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 have suffered a little while, will

329
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Himself," that God,

330
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Creator God, "will Himself restore

331
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 you and make you strong,

332
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 firm, and steadfast. To Him

333
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 be the power forever and ever.

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Amen." Now let me just show

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 you something real quick. Consider if you've been in church

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 for a while, how many memory verses are

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 in this little section of Scripture, back to back to back.

338
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 You ever heard this? "Clothe yourself with humility."

339
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 You ever heard, "God opposes the proud

340
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 but gives grace to the humble." You ever heard,

341
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 "Cast all your anxieties on Him, because He

342
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 cares for you." Have you ever heard, "Your enemy, the

343
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for

344
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 someone to devour." All

345
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 those verses are jam-packed right

346
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 here in this little section of Scripture,

347
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 back to back to back. And they all seem like

348
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 new ideas. I want to show you, I don't think they are.

349
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I think that they're

350
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 tied together. And so as we move through

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 this, we're going to look at how pride brings opposition,

352
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 humility brings help.

353
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And before you leave here

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 this evening, Peter,

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 who wrote this to

356
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 the persecuted church,

357
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 is going to tell us to put on humility.

358
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Put it on.

359
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And so,

360
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 it says, "All of you, clothe yourself with humility

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 toward one another, because God

362
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 opposes the proud but shows favor to the

363
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 humble." My first point this

364
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 evening is that pride brings opposition.

365
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 That if you find yourself

366
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 thinking a lot about yourself,

367
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 or better said,

368
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 thinking about yourself a lot,

369
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 you are going to find yourself

370
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 marching against opposition.

371
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 The opposition of God,

372
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 the opposition of self, and the opposition

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 of Satan. All of those

374
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 forces will be coming against you when

375
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 you begin to think about yourself

376
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 too much.

377
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Now this is something that we do. When I say

378
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 the opposition of God, it says God opposes

379
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 the proud, but shows

380
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 favor to the humble. It says that we're to put

381
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 on humility. Here's what I would tell you.

382
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Just like you identify a team by their

383
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 uniform, like if you're watching a game,

384
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 you know who's playing by the colors

385
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 that they're wearing.

386
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 You can see whether it's the Cowboys

387
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 or the Mavericks or whoever it is

388
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 based on the uniform that they have.

389
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 When you wear pride,

390
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 you are wearing the uniform of the

391
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 other team. When I say the other

392
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 team, I mean the team that is playing

393
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 against God.

394
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 That you have the Creator of the heavens and the

395
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 earth working, actively

396
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 working against you, the most powerful

397
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 force in the world.

398
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 So he says, "Humble

399
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty

400
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 hand, that He may lift you up in due time.

401
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Cast all your anxiety

402
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 on Him, because He cares for you."

403
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And this verse

404
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 reveals something very interesting

405
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 and yet extremely unpopular.

406
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 That

407
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 the source

408
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 of anxiety is pride.

409
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And the solution

410
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 is humility.

411
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Now stay with me there, don't let me lose you

412
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 with just a band-aid statement like

413
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 "the solution is humility."

414
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 We'll dive deeper into that.

415
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 But consider this for a moment,

416
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 that the source of

417
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 anxiety is pride.

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I know

419
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 that doesn't feel helpful, but if it is true,

420
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 then we can test it

421
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 and I think it will prove

422
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 to be helpful. Let's just consider

423
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 testing it for a second.

424
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 If there's something,

425
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 if there's someone rather,

426
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 and they're cared for

427
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 by someone who

428
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 is all-powerful,

429
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 they're in the care and the

430
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 protection of someone who is all-powerful.

431
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 If that person feels

432
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 absolutely loved and absolutely

433
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 protected and absolutely provided

434
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 for, can they

435
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 be anxious?

436
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And yet if we take God

437
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 at His promises, are we not absolutely

438
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 loved? Absolutely

439
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 provided for? And

440
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 absolutely protected by God, the

441
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 creator of the heavens and the earth?

442
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 That a sparrow doesn't hit the ground apart

443
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 from His will.

444
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And then the struggle is, "Well then,

445
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I want to believe that, but how do I believe

446
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 that more? How do I jump

447
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 over that hurdle where I can take God at

448
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 His promises, that I can believe upon

449
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 those things?" We're going to see in the Scripture.

450
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 The core

451
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 of our anxiety is doubt of God's goodness,

452
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 which is to say,

453
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 we know better about God's character than He

454
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 declares. We begin

455
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 to question, "Is He good? Does He love us?

456
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Can He actually protect us?

457
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Does He have the power to protect us?"

458
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Anxiety is not a battle

459
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 against something else, but

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 it's a battle against ourselves. And so this is the

461
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 opposition of self. Pride brings

462
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 opposition.

463
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 If you can rid yourself of pride,

464
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 you will in turn rid yourself of anxiety.

465
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It says, "Be alert and of sober

466
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 minds. Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a

467
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.

468
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Resist him. Resist him.

469
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Standing firm in the faith, because you know

470
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 that the family of believers throughout the world

471
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.

472
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And it seems like such a new thought,

473
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 that he's just jumping, okay? God opposes the

474
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 kingdom. Cast your anxieties on Him. Hey, your enemy,

475
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion. But they're not.

476
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 They're not new thoughts. I think

477
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 what Peter is telling us

478
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 is that the things that we're anxious about

479
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 are the playpen that Satan plays in.

480
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 It's the fence.

481
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Like, he knows what we're

482
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 worried about. He knows what we're anxious about.

483
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And that's where he's going after. You're never going

484
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 to get married. You're

485
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 going to stay single. You're like, "They don't like you.

486
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Hey, you're not going to make enough

487
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 money. You're never going to make six figures.

488
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 You might lose your job."

489
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 He knows that. He's just there. Boom. Boom.

490
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 He's looking for the chinks in your armor,

491
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 the gaps in your armor, and he's just shooting

492
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 fiery darts right there.

493
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 He knows where you doubt.

494
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And your pride

495
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 feeds that lion.

496
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Your pride feeds that

497
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 lion. He feasts

498
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 on those things that

499
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 you trust in other than

500
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 God. He feasts on the areas

501
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 of your life where you don't trust

502
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 God and the ask, the command

503
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 is that you would starve him.

504
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 He's a stray cat.

505
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 He's a stray cat.

506
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 He's a smelly cat. Phoebe from

507
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Friends would write a song about him.

508
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 That's who he is, and he's just

509
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 hanging around. And if you feed a stray

510
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 cat, what's he going to do? "Oh, man.

511
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Give me some more. Give me some

512
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 more. I like that. Give me some more.

513
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I'm not going anywhere." If you

514
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 starve a stray cat, what's he do?

515
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 He leaves.

516
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Satan

517
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 works like Netflix.

518
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Okay?

519
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 He does. Netflix and Satan,

520
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 they're one and the same.

521
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Here's

522
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 what he does, right? You know how Netflix works, right?

523
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It's like, "Oh, oh, you like

524
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Friends? Oh, you watch Friends?

525
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 How about Seinfeld? How about this? How about--

526
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Oh, you like Stranger Things

527
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Episode 1 or Season 1? How about Season

528
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 2? Season 2 just came out. Do you like Season 2?

529
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Oh, you like horror films.

530
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Oh, you like violence, huh?

531
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 How about this violence? How about this violence?

532
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 How about this violence? How about this violence? How about this violence?

533
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Oh, you are desperate to get

534
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 married. Here's some romantic comedies

535
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 to fill your tank.

536
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Watch this. Watch this. Watch this.

537
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Watch this. Watch this. You see how he works?

538
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 You feed him, and he just

539
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 starts putting things in front of you. You don't even

540
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 realize that you're feeding the very

541
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 struggles that you don't want.

542
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 That those struggles are growing because their

543
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 appetite's growing because you're feeding them

544
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 one by one through a song, through a movie,

545
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 through a video, through the things that you like, through

546
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 magazines, through your Pinterest folder.

547
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 You're just feeding them,

548
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 and they're growing.

549
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 They're growing. Oh.

550
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Oh, you like to

551
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 look at people naked

552
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 in the act of sex.

553
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Oh.

554
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Let me put that in front

555
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 of you here. Let me put that in

556
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 front of you here. Let me put that in front

557
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 of you here. Let me put that in front of you

558
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 here. Let me put that in front of you here. Do you

559
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 see the lie of one last time? I'm going to look

560
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 one last time. I'm going to do that one last time.

561
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And that appetite just

562
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 grows. That's all you did was feed something.

563
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 It's now harder to stop.

564
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 I'm going to do it one last time.

565
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 No, you're not. You're going to do it

566
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 2,000 more times because you did

567
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 it one more time.

568
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 See what you did?

569
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 You fed him.

570
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 When I actively looked at pornography,

571
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 speaking of pornography,

572
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 it was interesting. It would pop up

573
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 everywhere. I couldn't get away from it.

574
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 It was on my

575
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 computers, on my hard drive. Everywhere I

576
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 go, boom, there it is. Boom, there it is. Every

577
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 billboard, every magazine,

578
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I'd sit in the grocery store. Boom,

579
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 it's in my face. Everywhere I turned, it was like

580
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 pornography, pornography, pornography. And I thought,

581
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I'll never get away from it. I'm going to be

582
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 stuck here. I'm going to look at this for the

583
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 rest of my life.

584
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And now, after

585
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 12 years of sobriety,

586
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I realize

587
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 that's not the case.

588
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 That to see it today, it

589
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 takes considerable work.

590
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 It's something that I would have to seek

591
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 out. It doesn't keep tripping me up.

592
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 It doesn't keep popping up in front of me.

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And you say, "Well, how did you get to

594
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 a place of recovery?" I asked for

595
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 help. I got to the end of

596
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 myself, and I thought, "You know what? I can't

597
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 defeat this thing by myself.

598
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 I need help. I need someone

599
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 to come in and help me. I need

600
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 someone to save me from this

601
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 thing that I'm feeding. I've grown

602
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 an appetite that is overwhelming.

603
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 I need help.

604
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I need help." And I

605
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 started asking for help. It's a position of humility.

606
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Recovery starts with

607
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 humility.

608
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 But your pride,

609
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 it will keep you sick.

610
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 You say, "Man, you can't tell somebody that. You can't

611
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 ask for help." Oh, you asked for help once. You know,

612
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 move on. You said something about it.

613
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 You brought it up to community. They didn't do anything. Keep going.

614
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 My second point from the Scripture is

615
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 that God helps the humble.

616
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 He shows favor to the humble.

617
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 He extends grace to the humble, your Scripture

618
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 may say, your Bible may say. My second point is

619
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 that God helps the humble. See,

620
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I thought I'd be addicted to porn my entire

621
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 life, but when I started

622
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 asking for help, and not just asking

623
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 for help, but finding a greater satisfaction

624
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 in Jesus,

625
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I found recovery. Let me

626
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 make that tangible.

627
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Finding a greater satisfaction in Jesus.

628
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 I started being discipled. I started

629
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 learning the Bible. I started doing

630
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 all the things that you keep saying you're going to do.

631
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2018,

632
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 man, that's your year. You're going to join

633
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 a church. You're going to get in community. You're going to

634
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 memorize some Scripture. You're going to get

635
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 a new Bible and read it every

636
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 single morning. I know.

637
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 I know.

638
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 I started doing those things.

639
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I started feeding on

640
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 sermons.

641
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I started educating myself

642
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 to God's Word and His commands.

643
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I started praying like my life

644
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 depended on it, crying out to God,

645
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 "Please, help me, God.

646
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 I want to stop picturing

647
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 women naked, God.

648
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 God, I'm perverted. Help me, Lord."

649
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And He did.

650
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Here's

651
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 what that looked like practically. I can

652
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 remember driving home from work every day. There's

653
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 a billboard on the side of

654
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 635. That's a highway here in

655
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Dallas.

656
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And every day

657
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 as I'd leave work, I'd drive by that billboard

658
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 and on that billboard was a woman in a bikini.

659
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 It was like

660
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 an advertisement for some adult store

661
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 underneath it. And every day I'd

662
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 look at that. I'd lust for that every

663
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 day.

664
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 On this particular day, I'm in the car

665
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 and I'm worshiping. I had left a

666
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Bible study and I had community that night

667
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 and I had read the Scriptures over lunch

668
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 and I was surrounded by men who

669
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 loved me and knew God and who knew me and

670
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 loved God. And so I'm there

671
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 in the car and it's me and Jesus and I'm talking

672
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 to Jesus and I'm praying and I sense

673
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 that that billboard's coming up because I'm driving

674
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 down the highway and it's getting closer and it's

675
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 getting closer. But it seems like

676
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 it feels like Jesus is in the car

677
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 with me because we're talking, we're commuting.

678
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 He feels close to me.

679
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And as I get closer to that billboard,

680
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 these words come out of my mouth all by myself

681
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 in the car. It's not worth it.

682
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 It's not worth this.

683
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Glancing up at that

684
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 two-dimensional

685
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 woman who I don't know

686
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 is not worth sacrificing

687
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 closeness to Jesus.

688
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 So you gotta ask every time, is a romantic

689
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 comedy worth it? Is watching that

690
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 one more time worth it? Is listening to that worth it?

691
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Is going there with your friends worth it?

692
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 One more drink, a shot, is it worth it?

693
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Is it worth this?

694
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Because the enemy's right there saying,

695
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 "Feed me. I'm hungry.

696
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Feed me.

697
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Feed me.

698
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Feed me."

699
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 But when your humble God comes to your aid,

700
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 we have one that

701
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 protects us. We are protected under

702
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 the hand of God.

703
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 We know our place, that we're

704
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 the ones that need protection and

705
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 we have a protector. It says, verse 6,

706
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 "Humble yourselves therefore under God's

707
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 mighty hand."

708
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 David's, King David's

709
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 go-to illustration, David and Goliath,

710
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 David and Bathsheba, David the shepherd boy,

711
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 David, his go-to illustration,

712
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 his go-to metaphor

713
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 for God was, "The Lord is

714
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 my," what?

715
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 "The Lord is my shepherd.

716
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 The Lord is

717
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 my shepherd." Now David was a shepherd.

718
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 He knew what this meant. And what he's

719
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 doing is he's putting himself in the story.

720
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 God is his shepherd. He is

721
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 a sheep. Now here's what's interesting about

722
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 being a sheep. Sheep is the most defenseless

723
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 animal in the animal kingdom.

724
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 They've got no claws.

725
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 They've got no sharp teeth. They've got no

726
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 thumbs. They've got nothing.

727
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 They've got no nunchucks or nothing to protect themselves.

728
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Right? They're sheep.

729
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 They are sheep. They've got no

730
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 crazy laughs, nothing. And so,

731
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 you know what

732
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 happens when a sheep is scared?

733
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 You know what happens when a sheep is scared?

734
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 It falls over.

735
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 True story.

736
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 It's a sponge with sticks

737
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 for legs. That's a sheep.

738
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Right? And so, here's

739
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 the deal. You're a

740
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 sheep.

741
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And if you think you're immune to pride,

742
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 you're going to be lunch.

743
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Because there's an enemy. There's a lion.

744
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 A sheep without a shepherd is

745
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 lunch.

746
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 But a sheep with a shepherd is loved,

747
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 protected,

748
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 and provided for.

749
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And we have a shepherd. We come under

750
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 his mighty hand. We humble

751
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 ourselves with a constant renewal

752
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 of our mind that there's a God,

753
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 creator of the heavens and the earth, and we

754
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 sit under him.

755
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 We sit under his

756
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 feet. We sit at his feet. We're under his

757
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 hands. He's our protector

758
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 and our provider.

759
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And as we come under his power, he lifts

760
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 us up, it says. That he's the force

761
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 behind us, pushing us forward.

762
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And it says, "Cast all your anxieties on him

763
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 because he cares for you."

764
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 It says, "Throw your anxieties

765
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 on him." Why? Why do I

766
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 throw my anxieties on him? It's like, "Throw your

767
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 anxieties." Like he's a coat rack. And you're,

768
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 "Throw your anxieties on him." How do I throw

769
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 my anxieties? Throw my anxieties on who?

770
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And why? And what? Because

771
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 God loves

772
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 you.

773
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Right now. Like,

774
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 not later. Not when you're not anxious.

775
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Like, when you're anxious,

776
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 he loves you.

777
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 He loves you.

778
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Everything you've done,

779
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 he knows and he chose you.

780
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 You're like, "How do I know he chose me?"

781
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Look around where you're at right now.

782
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 You're at church.

783
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 On a Tuesday

784
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 night. You're not at, you know,

785
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 $2 margarita bar,

786
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 whatever, right? No, you're here.

787
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And it's not by chance.

788
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And I'm not saying because you're here, you're saved.

789
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 I'm saying because you're here, he's pursuing

790
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 you.

791
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And you need to come to the end of yourself

792
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 and look up and say, "God, I'm ready.

793
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 I'm ready.

794
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I need your help."

795
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 He loves you.

796
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And we're about to go on a break.

797
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Not gonna meet for

798
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 a few weeks.

799
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And I want you to change

800
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 some things about your life.

801
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 I want you to stop playing

802
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 games. I want you

803
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 to get serious about this

804
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 relationship with Jesus.

805
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I want you to start talking to him.

806
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 I want you to carve out

807
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 some time every single day and prioritize

808
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 him. And even when you're doing

809
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 the other things that you do, you're

810
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 prioritizing him in your mind. You're thinking

811
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 that he's sending you to places, the places

812
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 that you're going, to work and the conversations

813
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 and the meetings and the classrooms, that

814
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 God's sending you there.

815
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And what he wants

816
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 from you most is he wants a relationship.

817
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 He cares for you.

818
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And he wants you to

819
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 cast your anxieties on him. What does that mean?

820
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 You talk to him about what you're concerned

821
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 about. I'll give you a picture of mine.

822
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 I've got a son,

823
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 five-year-old, Weston.

824
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 He's a good boy.

825
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 We're sitting in the living room. He's sitting

826
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 by the fire. It was cold the other day in Dallas

827
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 and we've got

828
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 a fire going and he's sitting by it on the

829
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 hearth, you know, the stone hearth there.

830
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 And I'm sitting on the couch and I'm thinking,

831
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 you know, the stone hearth there. And I'm sitting

832
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 on the couch and

833
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 he says, and he's five-year-old way, he says,

834
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 "Daddy," I'm like, "Yes, yeah, buddy."

835
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 "I'd like to talk

836
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 with you."

837
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 I was like, "Okay, man."

838
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 But I get the sense like this is

839
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 something serious, like not just

840
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 monster trucks and remote-controlled cars.

841
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Like he wants to chat. And so he's

842
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 sitting there and so I come and sit on the

843
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 other side of the fireplace just like him.

844
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And so we're both kind of sitting there toes-to-toes,

845
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 just like this. I'm like, "What's up, buddy?" I'm looking at him.

846
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 I'm like, "What's up, buddy?" And I'm like, "Talk to me."

847
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And he's like, "Daddy, I just don't know

848
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 why I do what I do."

849
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 I'm like, "What did you do?"

850
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 You know? And

851
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 he's like, "Daddy, it's like my mind,

852
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 like these things come to my mind and

853
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 the things that I want to do I don't

854
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 do, but the things that I don't want to do,

855
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 these things I keep on doing."

856
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And

857
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 for those of you

858
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 that know the Bible, that's

859
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Romans 7. He's preaching.

860
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And he's just preaching

861
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 at me and I'm like, "Buddy," and this is what

862
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 I say. And he's just struggling. I'm, dude, tears

863
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 in his eyes. I'm tormented right now.

864
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 And

865
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 I said, "Well, buddy, that's why you have me."

866
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 He said, "Man, I'll help you to know what to do

867
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 and you can ask me and when you've done something

868
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 that you shouldn't have done, you can come to me.

869
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And as much as I'm able, I'll

870
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 make it right. And if I'm not able to make it right,

871
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 then you'll come with me and we'll go

872
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 in it together and we'll say, 'Man, look what we did.'

873
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 And I'll help you.

874
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 And I'll do that for the rest of your life. That's really my commitment

875
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 to you.

876
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 If you don't know what is

877
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 right and what is wrong, I'll tell you

878
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 and if you've done wrong,

879
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 if you've done the wrong thing,

880
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 you can come to me and I'll do everything I can

881
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 to help you out of that wrong thing

882
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 and to point you back to the right way.

883
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 That's my commitment to you."

884
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And he says,

885
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 "Daddy,

886
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I'm really glad we had this talk."

887
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 [laughter]

888
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I said, "Me too, buddy." I mean, it melted my heart, right?

889
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 I said, "Hey,

890
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 you're a good boy."

891
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 He said, "You're a good daddy."

892
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 I know, that's what I said. I'm like, "I'm done.

893
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I'm done."

894
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And, um,

895
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 and it was just the sweetest thing

896
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 and here's what I thought after that.

897
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 I'm like, "That's what God wants from me."

898
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Do you see just

899
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 the humility there?

900
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Like, "God, can we talk?"

901
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 "Daddy,

902
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 the things

903
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 that I want to do,

904
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 I don't do and

905
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 the things that you tell me not to do,

906
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 those things I keep doing, I keep going

907
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 back to her, I keep looking at that,

908
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I keep clicking on that, I call him again.

909
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 I want that.

910
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 That list of Ten Commandments,

911
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 I've broken all of them.

912
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I need your help.

913
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 From this moment forward,

914
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 can you

915
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 convict me ever so severely

916
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 in the situation that I would always choose right?

917
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And when I've chosen wrong,

918
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 will you help me?

919
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Will you remind me to come to you

920
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 that you can make it right

921
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 even when I've chosen wrong?

922
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 That you can show me a way out of that?

923
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Will you help me?

924
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Will you remind me to come to you

925
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 that you can make it right

926
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 even when I've chosen wrong?

927
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 May that mark your break.

928
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Lots of

929
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 conversations like that.

930
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 It's a huge act of faith.

931
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 It's probably the most

932
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 productive, no, it is the most

933
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 productive thing that you can do.

934
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 It allows God to remind you that He

935
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 can handle your problems and how can He remind you

936
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 if He doesn't have the opportunity to remind you

937
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 if you're not going to Him with your

938
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 problems, if you're not going to Him with

939
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 your anxiety. See, anxiety,

940
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 when it drives you to prayer, is a gift.

941
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Anxiety

942
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 that pushes you to God,

943
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 that is a gift.

944
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 But anxiety that distracts you from

945
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 God, it is a curse.

946
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 It is the enemy's playpen.

947
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 It's where he's jacking

948
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 with you and he'll keep jacking

949
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 with you because he loves to distract

950
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 you from God. It's his goal.

951
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And so we'll summarize,

952
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 or we'll wrap up rather,

953
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 with the

954
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 exhortation, the admonishment to

955
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 wear humility. He says, "Clothe

956
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 yourself in humility."

957
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 It's how he starts. "Clothe yourself

958
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 in humility that we're His,

959
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 that we belong to God, therefore we have

960
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 a new uniform. We've got new team

961
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 colors. We've got something else to

962
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 wear." Salvation actually starts with humility,

963
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 right? Because salvation starts with

964
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 you coming to a place saying, "Hey God, I

965
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 can't. I need help."

966
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 We're looking at the Ten Commandments and the

967
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Thou Shalt series and it's like, "I've broken that one, I've

968
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 broken that one." The law, the only thing,

969
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 listen closely, the only thing the law can

970
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 do is show you that you can't keep the

971
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 law. That's Romans 8.

972
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And if you see that you can't

973
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 keep the law, then you realize you need someone

974
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 to save you from yourself.

975
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 That's Jesus. That's the power of the

976
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 gospel. God doesn't expect you to

977
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 keep the law. He expects you to realize that

978
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 you can't keep the law so that you come to

979
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 a place so that you realize that you need a

980
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Savior. And do you know that

981
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 a Savior's job description is saving?

982
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Jesus is really,

983
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 really, really good at moving

984
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 toward people in their time of need.

985
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 He's the best at it.

986
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And so you come to a place

987
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 where you say, "God, I need help." That's

988
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 a place of humility. And that's where

989
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 salvation starts. And in that moment,

990
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 you have new clothes to wear. Those are the

991
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 clothes of humility. That you would

992
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 clothe yourself in humility. What does that mean?

993
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 That means that when somebody looks at you,

994
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 they don't see somebody peacocking,

995
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 they don't see someone rolling around saying, "Hey,

996
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 look at me. I'm the big man on

997
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 campus. I'm Mr. Dallas,

998
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Mr. Fort Worth, I'm Mr. H-Town."

999
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 No, they see somebody

1000
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 and say, "I'm a servant of the king.

1001
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 I don't need you to

1002
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 like me. I don't need you to think more of me.

1003
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 I don't need more trinkets and treasures.

1004
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 I serve the king. All the trinkets

1005
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 and treasures are his.

1006
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 I just carry his chair.

1007
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 I'll sit at

1008
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 his throne. I'm a servant."

1009
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 So you clothe yourself

1010
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 in humility.

1011
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 What that tells me, guys,

1012
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 and consider this,

1013
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 that tells me that humility is something

1014
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 you actively put on. That it

1015
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 doesn't naturally happen. That pride naturally

1016
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 happens. In the flesh, pride

1017
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 will consume you, but you have to work.

1018
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 You have to do something to

1019
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 put on humility. And so consider

1020
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 when it's cold outside. Remember when you were

1021
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 little, it's cold outside, and your mom's like, "Hey,

1022
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 you need to put on a coat." "Why do I need to put on

1023
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 a coat?" "Because it's cold outside. And if you

1024
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 don't put on a coat, you're going to be cold."

1025
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Now, picture yourself at the

1026
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 beach. There's no clouds in the sky.

1027
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 The sun's at high noon. It's coming down

1028
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 hot. It's 127

1029
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 degrees in Texas, and there you are.

1030
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 And somebody says, "Hey, you better

1031
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 put on some sunscreen.

1032
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Because if you don't put on sunscreen,

1033
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 you're going to get burned."

1034
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And what

1035
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Peter's telling us, what the Holy Spirit is

1036
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 telling us through His servant Peter

1037
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 is that we've got to put on

1038
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 humility or else we are standing in

1039
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 opposition to the most powerful

1040
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 force in the universe.

1041
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And that ain't going to go well

1042
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 for us.

1043
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And so we put on

1044
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 humility.

1045
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 What does this look like

1046
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 practically?

1047
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Every day you've got things to do.

1048
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 You've got meetings every day. Some of

1049
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 you have got a Microsoft Outlook calendar.

1050
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 It kind of tells you where you need to go

1051
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 and when. And so I've got a friend,

1052
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 one of the most godly men I know,

1053
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 and every day he wakes up.

1054
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 And the same way that I wake up and I think about, "Okay, what do

1055
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 I have today? I'm teaching at the porch.

1056
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 What am I going to wear?"

1057
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 I don't have any meetings.

1058
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 "Hey, it's casual Friday. I'm going to

1059
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 wear athletic shorts." You think about

1060
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 what you're going to wear based on what

1061
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 you have to do. And so every day my friend,

1062
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 he wakes up, he looks at

1063
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 his appointments, and he looks at the meetings

1064
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 and he's like, "Man, I'm going to have to really wear some humility

1065
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 to that one."

1066
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 You know what I mean?

1067
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 She annoys me.

1068
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 I'm not pointing at you. I'm pointing

1069
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 at imaginary

1070
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 "She annoys me."

1071
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 And so for that

1072
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 one I'm going to have to really put on some humility.

1073
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 "Oh man, when I go home for Christmas

1074
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 that one,

1075
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 I'm going to have to really wear

1076
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 some humility. When I go to that meeting,

1077
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 oh I've got my funnel review,

1078
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 oh I've got that appointment with the boss, appointment with the

1079
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 principal, oh when I meet with those

1080
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 parents,

1081
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 I'm going to have to really wear humility

1082
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 to that one." And you

1083
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 consciously think about it.

1084
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 And you humble yourself

1085
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 under God's mighty hand. And you

1086
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 clothe yourself in humility.

1087
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Because what it says, think about what it says,

1088
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 it says, "And God will exalt you.

1089
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 God will lift you up. God will take

1090
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 care of you." Now I want to say something

1091
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 important here.

1092
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Those are not expectations.

1093
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 They're explanations.

1094
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Do you see what I'm saying?

1095
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Because if you say, "Well I'm going to leave here and

1096
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 I'm going to be humble so that God can exalt me,"

1097
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 that's being prideful. It doesn't

1098
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 work that way. You say, "Hey,

1099
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 I'm going to leave here and I'm going to be humble because

1100
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 God is God.

1101
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 And I'm a servant."

1102
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 And then what he does

1103
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 as an explanation for that person

1104
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 who's truly humble, he lifts

1105
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 up, he exalts.

1106
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 So you don't be humble to be exalted.

1107
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 You be humble because

1108
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 you understand who God is.

1109
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 And so,

1110
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 we're dressing up in humility. Like I

1111
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 said, my friend literally plans out his

1112
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 day based on where he needs to wear

1113
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 humility. And to say something

1114
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 in a different way, it's Peter saying,

1115
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 "Hey, humility looks good on everyone."

1116
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Okay? It's that little black dress you

1117
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 can wear to the funeral and the wedding

1118
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 and on the date. You know, humility is that

1119
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 button-down shirt that you told

1120
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 your friends is illegal in 48 states because you

1121
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 look so good in it. Like that is

1122
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 humility, right?

1123
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 So you wear that.

1124
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 You put it on just like

1125
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 that shirt.

1126
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 And I want you to know, and we'll

1127
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 wrap up with this idea,

1128
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 is that you're not the only one

1129
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 wearing this uniform.

1130
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 You're not the only

1131
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 one wearing this uniform. See, it says, "Resist

1132
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 him standing firm in the faith

1133
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 because you know that the family of believers throughout

1134
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 the world

1135
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 is undergoing the same kind of suffering."

1136
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 And this is an important

1137
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 aspect of humility.

1138
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 The humble, humble people

1139
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 know that they are tempted

1140
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 just like

1141
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 everyone else.

1142
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 All the other people who

1143
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 are wearing the same kind

1144
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 of uniform. And so, maybe

1145
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 you're sitting there and moments ago, you're like,

1146
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 "Man, how does he talk about

1147
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 pornography so freely? I can't even say the word."

1148
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 And like he just talks about,

1149
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 like, "Really? Gosh, that prayer was

1150
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 graphic. Wow."

1151
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 And here's how.

1152
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Because I know you struggle just like I do.

1153
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 Guys and girls alike

1154
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 all over the planet Earth,

1155
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 we struggle in the same

1156
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 ways. And when you

1157
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 start saying, "No, no, no, no, no, no. You don't

1158
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 get it, man. You haven't been where I'm at.

1159
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 You haven't struggled with this kind of depression

1160
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 that I have or this anxiety

1161
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 it's unique to me." Or, "Hey, bro, what

1162
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 do you know about same-sex attraction?

1163
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 You haven't walked in my shoes. You don't know what it's like.

1164
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 What do you want to be? To be celibate my entire

1165
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 life?" You've taken a position of pride.

1166
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 Can I tell you something?

1167
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 See, what happens is when I get done preaching up here,

1168
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 as I stand up here, and then what happens is you guys

1169
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 come up and you want to chat. And then what happens

1170
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 is the same thing every

1171
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 single week is somebody comes

1172
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 up, they look over. And I don't mean, I'm not trying to

1173
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 be disrespectful in this. I'm just

1174
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 saying what happens. They look over their shoulders,

1175
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 "Hey, man, can I talk to you? Hey, you mind

1176
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 if we come over here?" I'm like, "No,

1177
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 you can talk to me right here. What's up? What's going on?"

1178
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 "Oh, man, I just like,

1179
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 you know, I struggle

1180
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 with same-sex attraction, bro. And just like

1181
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 there's no other Christians who

1182
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 do that. And I'm just by myself and I'm the only

1183
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 one." And then we pray and we talk

1184
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 and we pray and hopefully say something

1185
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 helpful. And then he leaves or she

1186
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 leaves and somebody else comes up. "Hey, man,

1187
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 mind if I talk to you over here?"

1188
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 "What's up? Talk to me right here."

1189
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 "Man, I just struggle with same-sex attraction.

1190
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 I'm the only one here." I'm like, "No, you're

1191
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 not. See that guy over there?"

1192
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 I don't do that.

1193
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 I don't do that. But it's

1194
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 every week. And listen, I

1195
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 picked on one thing. Let me go with another,

1196
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 okay? I picked on one story. Let me go with another.

1197
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 "Hey, my struggle

1198
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 is the same as yours."

1199
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 "What do you mean?"

1200
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 "Oh, pornography."

1201
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 "Yeah, do you mind? Can I talk

1202
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 to you?" "No, it's good. You're good.

1203
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 Talk to me right here. What's up?" "I want to help."

1204
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 "Man, I'm just really struggling with

1205
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 porn. How do you access pornography?"

1206
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 "I'm on my phone, bro.

1207
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 My phone." "Where's your

1208
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 phone right now?"

1209
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 "It's in my pocket."

1210
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 "You're not struggling.

1211
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 You're carrying the lion around with you

1212
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 in your pocket.

1213
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 You hadn't started

1214
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 struggling. You're just feeding.

1215
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 You're not fighting.

1216
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 What do you

1217
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 want me to do? Get rid of my phone?" "Sure."

1218
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 "Yes."

1219
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 End of word.

1220
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 "What am I supposed to have? A flip phone?"

1221
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 "Yeah, why not?

1222
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Get you a flip phone.

1223
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Get you a razor. Remember those things? They were cool.

1224
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 You know?

1225
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 Everybody had a razor.

1226
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Get you a razor.

1227
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 You won't have to look at porn.

1228
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 Can't look at porn on a razor.

1229
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 It's all grainy.

1230
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 You know? That's not cool."

1231
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Here's what I mean, okay?

1232
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 I think I ruffled some feathers

1233
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 on that last one, so let me just hear me out

1234
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 on this, okay? I know that Peter's

1235
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 writing to the persecuted church.

1236
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 He's writing at a time when Christians are

1237
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 literally fed to lions. I get that.

1238
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 And I think the way that

1239
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 the verse applies to

1240
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 the church today in a time of

1241
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 abundance where we can worship freely and

1242
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 raise our hands and bring our Bibles in public,

1243
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 it can apply to

1244
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 temptation in the same way that 1 Corinthians

1245
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 10:13 does. 1 Corinthians 10:13

1246
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 says this, "No temptation

1247
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 has seized you except what is

1248
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 common to mankind."

1249
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 And God is faithful.

1250
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 He will not allow you to be tempted

1251
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 beyond what you can bear.

1252
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 And when you are tempted, He will provide

1253
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 a way out so that you can stand up under it.

1254
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 Here's what He's saying. God will never

1255
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 put you in a cage with a lion and lock

1256
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 the door. If He ever puts you in a

1257
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 cage with a lion, He's going to give you a key.

1258
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 He's going to show you a way out.

1259
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 He's going to put a bright red exit

1260
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 sign up saying, "Hey, come this way.

1261
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Don't jack with that lion. Don't feed

1262
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 that lion. You come with Me.

1263
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 I've got something

1264
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 better for you."

1265
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 And so your situation is not

1266
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 unique. You are tempted

1267
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 just like millions of other people are

1268
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 tempted. And you

1269
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 can stand firm in the same

1270
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 way that Jesus in the garden stood

1271
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 firm. Peter stood firm.

1272
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 The Apostle Paul stood firm.

1273
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 The saints that have gone before you

1274
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 for centuries and centuries

1275
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 and centuries have stood firm.

1276
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 You too can stand firm. You

1277
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 do not ever for the rest

1278
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 of your life have to sin.

1279
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Ever. It will never happen.

1280
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 That you

1281
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 will always have a choice to make.

1282
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 I can feed my

1283
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 flesh. I can feed the

1284
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 lion. I can come in the

1285
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 opposition of God or I can

1286
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 humble myself and walk out the door.

1287
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 Get out of the

1288
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 cage.

1289
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 I can move on.

1290
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 I can choose something better.

1291
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And you say,

1292
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 "Man,

1293
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 you don't understand.

1294
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 Life of celibacy,

1295
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 man, that's terrifying."

1296
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 It is for a little

1297
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 while. And then

1298
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 you go to heaven.

1299
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 And then it's not.

1300
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 And so

1301
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 you say, "What do I do?" Let me ask you this. Is there

1302
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 anything you could do today to pursue God more?

1303
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 Do that.

1304
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 Do that. And the God of all grace,

1305
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 verse 10, who called you to His eternal

1306
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 glory in Christ, "After you

1307
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 have suffered a little while, will Himself restore

1308
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 you and make you strong, firm

1309
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 and steadfast." You see, He says

1310
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 He'll make you strong, firm and steadfast. He will

1311
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 help you carry the chairs.

1312
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 He will help you carry the weight of life.

1313
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 You don't have to do it on your own.

1314
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 That when you humble yourself,

1315
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 God, the strongest

1316
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 being in the history of history, will

1317
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 come beside you and help

1318
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 you and make you strong, firm

1319
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 and steadfast. And then He ends in worship

1320
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 to Him be the power forever

1321
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 and ever. Amen. And I love

1322
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 that idea that earthly humility

1323
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 leads to eternal worship.

1324
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 See, you don't need to be king here.

1325
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 You need to know the king here.

1326
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 You can stop going through

1327
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 this life saying, "Hey, look at

1328
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 me and how many followers do I have?

1329
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 And how many likes did I get? And I want

1330
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 people to love me and to know me and to like me."

1331
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 You just go through life saying, "Hey, I know

1332
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 the king and I'm loved by him."

1333
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 And you're a road

1334
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 sign.

1335
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 You're a road sign pointing to King

1336
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 Jesus. That's your

1337
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 role. You know those guys

1338
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 that whenever

1339
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 there's a king, like in those movies where there's a bunch

1340
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 of guys carrying the throne, walking

1341
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 down the street, holding them up.

1342
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 You've seen that in a... That's your role.

1343
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 You carry the king's chair

1344
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 for the rest of your days.

1345
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 That's your role.

1346
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 Embrace that. Sometimes

1347
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 humility starts with just embracing

1348
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 obscurity. "I'm okay if I'm not

1349
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 known. I'll preach

1350
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 the gospel, die and be forgotten.

1351
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 I'm okay

1352
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 if you don't like me.

1353
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 I want to tell you the truth with grace.

1354
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 I want to point you to

1355
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 Jesus. I want

1356
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 to show you the way.

1357
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 You need to be okay if they don't like you.

1358
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 You need to be

1359
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 okay if you're alone like Noah

1360
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 building an ark like a crazy

1361
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 man. You just embrace obscurity.

1362
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 It's

1363
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 alright.

1364
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 You're going to die like everybody else has died.

1365
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 If you've trusted in Christ, you're going to go be with

1366
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 Him forever. Your

1367
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 obscurity down here won't matter

1368
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 there."

1369
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 Moving toward Christmas.

1370
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 When my son

1371
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 prays, the same little boy prays.

1372
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 He

1373
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 always says the

1374
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 same thing. He says, "God,

1375
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 thank you that we get presence

1376
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 on your birthday."

1377
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 I love the observation

1378
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 that he made himself.

1379
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 That God's a generous God and that

1380
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 on His birthday we get presence.

1381
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 It's the

1382
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 paradox of faith.

1383
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 That on His death we get life.

1384
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 That when

1385
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 He loses His life, we get eternal

1386
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 security. We get

1387
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 eternal life.

1388
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 That when He

1389
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 dies, our sins are

1390
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 forgiven. That when He

1391
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 endures the wrath of God, we get

1392
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 freedom from that.

1393
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 That at His funeral,

1394
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 we receive salvation.

1395
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 I think that

1396
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 God loves a humble heart because

1397
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 God has a humble heart.

1398
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 We see that

1399
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 humble heart just in the way that when He came

1400
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 here, He came here to serve us.

1401
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 Even with His life and even

1402
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 in His death, He came here

1403
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 to serve us.

1404
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 In summary, pride

1405
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 brings opposition.

1406
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 God helps the humble.

1407
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 I encourage you to wear

1408
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 humility.

1409
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 I don't know if you guys

1410
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 saw that Prince

1411
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 Harry is engaged. You guys see this?

1412
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 If you've

1413
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 been on a computer, you've seen that.

1414
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 Then

1415
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 there's the other

1416
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 guy. What's his name? Oh, yeah.

1417
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 William and

1418
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 Kate.

1419
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 They're pregnant.

1420
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 Do you see this? Having a royal baby,

1421
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 their third child.

1422
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 Just think about this for a minute. We'll wrap

1423
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 up here.

1424
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 Think about the care that that little

1425
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 baby's going to get. Royal child.

1426
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 Best

1427
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 doctors in the whole world. In the most

1428
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 amazing delivery room that your

1429
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 mind can possibly fathom.

1430
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 The softest sheets.

1431
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 The

1432
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 most incredible pajamas. Their

1433
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 pajamas cost more than my car.

1434
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 That little baby's pajamas.

1435
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 Everybody's going to be fighting.

1436
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 The media's going to be fighting over who can

1437
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 cover the

1438
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 birth of that child.

1439
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 Contrast

1440
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 that with the humility of God.

1441
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 That when

1442
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 God came here 2017

1443
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 years ago in an event that reset the calendar,

1444
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 He

1445
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 came to

1446
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 a town that you would have never heard of.

1447
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 It's like a

1448
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 suburb of Van.

1449
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 Like Lindale. That's where

1450
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 He came. Bethlehem. You would have

1451
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 never heard of Bethlehem except Jesus

1452
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 was born there.

1453
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 When He came,

1454
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 the God who created

1455
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 the entire world couldn't

1456
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 find a room to be

1457
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 born in. There was no

1458
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 room.

1459
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 He went in a cave. It was a cave.

1460
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 I've been in the cave.

1461
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 Supposedly the cave He was born in,

1462
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 I've been in it. It's where they kept

1463
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 animals.

1464
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 That when the King of kings and the

1465
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 Lord of lords was born here,

1466
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 the shouts of "It's a boy!" were

1467
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 covered with the sounds of animals.

1468
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 The delivery room was

1469
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 filled with the stench of animal

1470
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 feces. That was Him.

1471
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 Where they put Him, they didn't know where to put Him.

1472
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 So they set Him in a feeding trough.

1473
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 A place where literally donkeys

1474
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 and cows just had their noses to eat.

1475
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 They set Him down in there. The King

1476
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 of kings, the one who formed you in your

1477
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 mother's womb, the one who all

1478
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 things were created by Him and for Him.

1479
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 The supremacy belongs to

1480
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 Him. The fullness of the deity

1481
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 dwelled in Him. That God, here.

1482
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 Crying.

1483
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 And as soon as He was born,

1484
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 kings wanted to kill Him.

1485
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 This little baby caused such

1486
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 a commotion. And He would die.

1487
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 He would die. But only after

1488
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 He lived a perfect life. A life

1489
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 you can't live.

1490
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 And He died because you can't live it.

1491
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 He endured the wrath of God.

1492
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 The most innocent person that

1493
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 has ever been died for your

1494
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 pornography and for your materialism

1495
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 and for your identity struggles

1496
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 and for your identity and singleness

1497
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 or marriage or wanting

1498
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 things. Your covetousness.

1499
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 Your adultery. Your fornication.

1500
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 Your drunkenness.

1501
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 Went on Him.

1502
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 And so this Christmas,

1503
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 I want you

1504
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 to spend this season

1505
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 the way Peter ends in worship.

1506
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 I want you to worship Him.

1507
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 With your all. That's what we're

1508
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 going to do tonight. We're just going to end the year

1509
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 in worship. And I

1510
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 don't want prideful

1511
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 worship. I want you to

1512
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 get lost in worship. A humble

1513
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 worship. It's you and God. Just you and God.

1514
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 You sing to Him.

1515
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 Like you would as if you saw

1516
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 the Savior of the world

1517
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 in the manger.

1518
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 I want you to sing like that.

1519
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 Watch this with me.

1520
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 (music)

1521
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 (music)

1522
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 (music)

1523
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,420
 (soft music)

1524
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,840
 (soft music)

1525
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,260
 (soft music)

1526
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,680
 (soft music)

1527
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:13,060
 (soft music)

1528
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:20,280
 (soft music)

1529
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:27,740
 (soft music)

1530
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,160
 (soft music)

1531
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:42,580
 (soft music)

1532
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:49,000
 (soft music)

1533
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:57,340
 (soft music)

1534
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,760
 (soft music)

1535
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:06,760
 (soft music)

1536
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:12,760
 (soft music)

1537
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:18,760
 (soft music)

1538
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:25,760
 (soft music)
