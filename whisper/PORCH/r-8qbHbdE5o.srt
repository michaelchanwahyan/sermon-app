1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Well, what's up Porch? How we doing tonight?

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 [Applause]

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hey, it's such a joy. It's so good to be back at the Porch.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 If we've never met before, my name is Timothy Atik

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 and I'm one of the pastors here at Watermark.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I want to give a huge shout out to all of the Porch Live locations watching tonight.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Hope all is well with you.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I know we've got counselors from Pine Cove in the city here with us.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Welcome. So glad that you made it.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 We are about to jump into a very important topic.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Tonight we are just focusing on the topic of pornography.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 You don't know whether to cheer or not.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 You're like, "If I cheer, does that mean I'm into it?

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 If I don't cheer, I don't know what to do."

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 So, the best thing to do is to just pray.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Alright, everyone bow their heads and just close their eyes.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 So we can avoid an awkward moment looking at each other.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So, hey, seriously, this is a really important part of my story

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 that I'm looking forward to sharing with you about.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 But I know that pornography is a part of many people's journeys right now.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 And so I just want to invite you to pray.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And just say, "God, would you speak to me tonight clearly?"

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And then would you pray for the other people in this room and around you?

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Just pray that God would speak clearly to them.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And then would you pray for me?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And would you pray that God would use me tonight in your lives?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Well, Lord, I pray that you would have your way with us tonight.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I pray that there would not be one person in this room that leaves tonight

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 without having had an encounter with you.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I pray that you would speak clearly to our hearts tonight.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 May our ears be open and may our hearts be receptive to anything

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 and everything that you would want to say.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Well, the summer between my eighth grade year and my freshman year in high school,

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 my dad and I, we were flying to Indianapolis to go to the Indy 500 race.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And on our way back to Dallas, we were in the Indianapolis airport,

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 and I stumbled upon an inappropriate magazine.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I don't know what caused me to do it.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Probably it was because I was an almost freshman in high school pubescent kid,

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 and I picked up this magazine without my dad knowing,

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 and I hid it in my stuff, and I took it home with me.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And I didn't realize that that one decision was the beginning

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 of what would be a seven-year intense battle with pornography.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Pornography became a very, very defining part of my story for the next seven years.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 And when I think back upon my intense battle with pornography,

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 there were various things that marked that struggle.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 The first was that I just believed that everyone struggled with porn.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Like, there was this statistic that people would float around

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 that 98% of guys look at porn, and the other 2% are just lying about it.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 That's what all the guys would tell themselves.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And so I just viewed myself as a stereotypical college guy

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 because everyone looks at porn.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Another thing that defined me was just a consistent appetite for more.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 What I would find is that there was certain images that would lose their effect,

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 and I would just want more.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I would want the material to be more explicit or more intense.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 There was just an insatiable growing appetite for more.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And then on top of that, there was the feeling of being a failure

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 because I was a Christian, and people knew me as a good Christian guy,

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 and yet so often throughout the week I was looking at pornography,

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 and so I felt like a hypocrite.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And so I would go through this cycle of promising God I'm done with that,

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 and then I might have a good few days or a good few weeks,

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 and then eventually I would just relapse back into pornography.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And then finally, something that marked my struggle with pornography

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 was a desire to be done with it, but this fear that I never would be.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 This desire, this hope that I would be done with it,

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 partnered with this fear that I never would be done with it.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And so I share that with you just to say,

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 I don't know if that feels a little bit like your journey.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 I don't know if you can identify with that at all.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 But if so, I just want you to know there is hope,

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 and the reason that I can say that is because I'm living it.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 The summer before my senior year in college,

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 God intervened in my life in a very clear and miraculous and supernatural way,

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 and the power of the gospel began to go to work on my heart,

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 and what God did, it wasn't an overnight thing,

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 but what He did was He set me on a path toward healing.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And for the last 19 years of my life,

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 the Lord has led me in freedom from pornography.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And so I tell you that to say, I stand up here as someone who can say,

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 look, there is hope, because I've been in a place where I felt like there was no hope.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And so now I stand up here, and I've shared my story,

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 my journey with pornography with thousands of people,

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 and the reason that I share it is because I don't have a story to hide,

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 I have a story to tell.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 My battle with pornography, it's not this anchor of shame

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 that I have to tow through my life.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 It's a trophy of God's grace because God intervened.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 He showed up, He moved, and it was solely because of His grace in my life

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 and His power at work through me in the mighty name of Jesus to break me free.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And so the reason that I wanted to step in and talk about this tonight

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 is to kind of piggyback off of what Kylan was talking about last week.

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Y'all walked through Colossians chapter 3 in this amazing series, "Above All,"

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 and I don't know if you remember last week, but in Colossians chapter 3,

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 the conversation was about putting off and putting on.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 There's the old and the new self, and there were certain things

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 that the Apostle Paul said that we should put to death.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Just to remind you, in Colossians chapter 3, verse 5, Paul says this.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 I'm going to back up. He says in verse 5,

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly in you,

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness,

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 which is idolatry."

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 What you need to know is all of those terms are sexual in nature.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 So Paul is looking at us saying, "You just need to put it to death."

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And so the reason that I want to talk about pornography is because

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 pastor and author James Emery White, here's what he said.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 "Pornography may be the greatest area of immorality

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 inflicted on and pursued by generation Z."

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Do you hear what he's saying? He's speaking about your generation,

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 and he's saying pornography is quite possibly the greatest source

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 of sin among your generation.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 It's the greatest source of sin inflicted upon you.

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 What he's saying is, "I sympathize with you.

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 You live in a day where it is more difficult to walk in freedom

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 from pornography than any point in history.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It's inflicted upon you, but it's also pursued by you."

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And so I care deeply about your generation knowing that there is hope,

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 so much so that when I did a doctoral program,

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I devoted all of my studies to pornography

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 and fighting for freedom among your generation.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And so what I want to do is I just want to help you take a step towards hope.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 If you're here tonight and you are in the midst of the battle,

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 what I want you to feel is hope.

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 If you're looking in the rearview mirror and pornography was a thing of your past,

127
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 what I want you to feel is gratitude.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And if you're here tonight and you're like, "Who struggles with pornography?"

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 What I want you to feel is a wake-up call,

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 that it's a part of people's stories all around you,

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 and God might want to use you to be a source of hope and healing for your friends.

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 So there's three things that I really want to address tonight.

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 I want to address the reality of porn, the results of porn, and the remedy for porn.

134
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And I'm just going to warn you up front the way that this talk is going to feel

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 because it's not going to feel like a normal message.

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 The first half of it is going to feel very research-based.

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 It's going to be a lot of facts and figures and quotes,

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 but it's good for us to deal with the information.

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And then we're just going to spend the second half of the message

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 really diving into the Scriptures, looking at the remedy for porn

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 so that you can leave here knowing that there is hope.

142
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Okay, you guys with me tonight?

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I'll take it, all right.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Let's start by talking about the reality of porn.

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And I'm going to share some things with you that are so obvious,

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 but it might just be helpful for you to hear it anyway.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 When I talk about the reality of porn, we just have to start with the fact

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 that porn is more accessible and acceptable than ever.

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Think about it. It's more accessible than ever.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Do you know when pornography started?

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 It started in the 1950s through Playboy,

152
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 which was this magazine for middle- to upper-class white men.

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 It started in print. Like, you had to go to a store to buy it.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And then in the 1980s, pornography made its way to film,

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 but again, you had to get up the courage to go to a video store

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 to rent a pornographic film, take it up to the counter, and check it out.

157
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Then in the early 2000s, pornography began to flourish on the Internet,

158
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 but even then, like, you had to do explicit searches

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 specifically for pornographic websites, and then when you went to them,

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 you would have to pay money for them.

161
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 But now, think about it. Porn exists on 12% of all websites in the world.

162
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 12% of them. It's on social media, it's in random text messages that you receive,

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 and it's on every streaming platform in the most popular shows of our day.

164
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 It's more accessible than ever.

165
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Like Pornhub, one of the largest pornographic websites in our world,

166
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 they publish a data report on their website every single year.

167
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 This is a stat all the way back from 2019, but just think about this.

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 In 2019 alone, 6.83 million new videos were uploaded.

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And they just wanted to give us an idea of how much new content that was.

170
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Here's what they said.

171
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 If you strung all of 2019's new video content together and started watching them

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 all the way back in 1850, you'd still be watching them today.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 That's just from one year of uploads on one site.

174
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 My point in telling you that is that it is more accessible than ever,

175
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 and what Pornhub reported is that 93% of the visits to their website

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 were accessed by a phone, and we all have phones.

177
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Here's what I'm telling you, and this might feel a little bit dramatic to you,

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 but it's just reality.

179
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Every single one of us is carrying around pornography in our pockets

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 every single day all day.

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 When I was battling pornography, there had to be this intentional effort

182
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 of going to your desktop computer to access it.

183
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Now it's just simply something that you access.

184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 You don't even have to access it.

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 It will just find you through your social media.

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 It's just reality.

187
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 It's more accessible than ever, but that accessibility is combined

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 within acceptability.

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Like one study found that your generation views not recycling as more immoral

190
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 than looking at porn.

191
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 That interesting?

192
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Not recycling is more immoral than looking at pornography.

193
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 96% of young adults are either encouraging, accepting, or neutral

194
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 when they talk about porn with their friends.

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 So just think about where you're at with that.

196
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Are you one of those people who are like, "You better recycle"?

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Looking at porn, it's up to you, but you better recycle.

198
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Like I'm checking to see if that blue bag is out every single Tuesday.

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 What is it for you? Where are you at with it?

200
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 When you talk about porn with your friends, when you joke about it,

201
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 do you joke about it in a positive light or a neutral at worst?

202
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 We live--the reality is we live in a pornified world.

203
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 What I mean by that is we just live in a world where it has become

204
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 so normalized.

205
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I remember watching the TV show Friends.

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 What a classic.

207
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Like I don't know how many of you all have gone back and binge-watched Friends,

208
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 but even on Friends in the '90s, porn was like--it was just a part of their lives.

209
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Like there's the episode where Joey and Chandler get free porn,

210
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 and it's just like a part of their day.

211
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 They're like, "We need to turn it off," and the minute they turn it off,

212
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 they're like, "Let's turn it back on to make sure we still have free porn."

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 It's just normalized.

214
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Pornhub totaled 2.14 billion visits during a single month in 2023,

215
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 which was more than Instagram, Netflix, Pinterest, and TikTok all combined.

216
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So let's just state what it is.

217
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Like porn is more accessible and acceptable than ever before.

218
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 That's just reality.

219
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Now I know I'm not telling you anything that you don't know,

220
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 so let's just keep moving.

221
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Here's more reality about porn.

222
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 It's not just a guy problem.

223
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Porn is a--it's a people--it's a people problem.

224
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 One study found that 57% of young adults seek porn out at least once a month.

225
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 For so long, pornography was considered just a guy problem.

226
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 But one survey of 3,000 women found that 31% of those 3,000 reported weekly porn use.

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 30% indicated viewing porn a few times a month.

228
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And I say that just to say, "Hey, you might be a woman in this room struggling with pornography,

229
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 and you feel even more shame because you think you're probably the only one because it's a guy problem."

230
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And I just want to tell you it is not.

231
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Like the first time I spoke on pornography was back in 2017.

232
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 The reason that I spoke on it is I sat with a group of college students,

233
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 and I asked them, "Hey, what do you want me to speak on?"

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Two of the ten people in the room, two girls and one guy said pornography.

235
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 It's because women have been increasingly more prone to struggling with pornography.

236
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I remember when I did speak on it, there were girls in the crowd who were like,

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 "Who struggles with pornography?"

238
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And what's crazy is that there was so many good, sweet Christian girls who were like,

239
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 "I'm struggling with pornography."

240
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And so what's happened is that guys feel the freedom to be like,

241
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 "Yeah, I've been struggling with it. I need some help."

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 And then girls feel like they've got to struggle over here alone

243
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 because it's just not something girls struggle with.

244
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And I just want to tell you it absolutely is.

245
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And this needs to be a safe place for you to come and just say, "Look, I need help. I need help."

246
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 The next thing that I want you to realize about the reality of porn is this.

247
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 This is very important.

248
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 The porn industry is seeking lifetime customers.

249
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Do you realize that?

250
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 The porn industry, the porn and sex tech industries are working to make you a lifetime customer

251
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 because I want you to understand the mission of the porn industry.

252
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 The mission of the porn industry is to convince you that sex virtually or sex in a fantasy world

253
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 is so much better than sex in the real world.

254
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 That's what they want to convince you of is that fantasy is better than reality.

255
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Here's what Pornhub Insights, their end-of-year report says.

256
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Listen to this. This is so interesting.

257
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 They say users looking for a more realistic porn viewing experience could tune in and unzip

258
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 getting everything they needed without all the real-world troubles.

259
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Who needs an in-real-life partner when you have point-of-view Pornhub videos on your side?

260
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Do you see what they're saying?

261
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 They're saying, "Look, sex in a fantasy world is just so much better. It's so much easier.

262
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 It's so much more customized. You can connect it with haptic technology

263
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 that just makes it a better experience."

264
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 What the porn industry has going for it is that there's so many people in our culture

265
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 who are just rationalizing the benefits of porn.

266
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 For example, a men's health article states that surges in testosterone caused by erotic films

267
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 can improve your squat strength at the gym.

268
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Who knew?

269
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Or a woman with the Sexual Wellness Center, here's what she explains.

270
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 She explains, "Women are increasingly viewing porn,

271
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 which hopefully means they are engaging in some self-pleasuring."

272
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 This is good news because it indicates that women are taking charge of their sexuality,

273
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 discovering their bodies and identifying what they like.

274
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Less shame, less taboo around female sexuality equals more exploration.

275
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 See the rationalization?

276
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 But in addition to rationalization, there's innovation.

277
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 So I want you to just think about the development of porn in terms of the five senses.

278
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 So the way pornography started out in the 1950s was just through sight.

279
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And then in the 1980s when it moved to film, it combined sight and sound.

280
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But now we're moving into a day and age where there is Bluetooth technology

281
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 that introduces sight, sound, and touch.

282
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And so what's interesting is, you know, in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s,

283
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 if someone wanted to get rid of porn, it was like, "Dude, you just need to throw out your magazines."

284
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 In the 1980s and '90s, it was, "Stop going to blockbuster video."

285
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 In the early 2000s, it was, "Dude, get rid of your Ethernet cable."

286
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I know I'm saying things that you're like, "I don't even know what he's talking about right now."

287
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 An Ethernet cable was a cable that connected your huge desktop computer to the wall, to the Internet.

288
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 But now we're in a day and time where we are moving closer to,

289
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 "Hey, dude, you need to get rid of your haptic technology, like your haptic suit."

290
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And in a matter of years, it's going to be like, "Dude, you've got to give up the sex robot.

291
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Like, let's just get real. It's time to get rid of it."

292
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And we can think, "Dude, that's crazy. That's not where we're headed."

293
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It most certainly is.

294
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Why?

295
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Because you have an industry that is trying to replace real-life experience.

296
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And so what they've done is they've taken deepfake technology,

297
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 so that now if you have enough images of anyone,

298
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 person you sat next to at Starbucks, person that works next to you,

299
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 someone you see at the gym, if you have enough pictures of them,

300
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 you can dump them into a program, and they'll take that person's--

301
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 they'll analyze their facial features, combine it with a porn star's body,

302
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 and you can be with whoever you want.

303
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Talk about a violation of your being.

304
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 But listen to what one guy in the sex tick industry says.

305
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 He says, "We are rapidly approaching a point where man and machine merge,

306
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 where sex can be better and safer outside of real life."

307
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 So I just tell you that, and some of you are like,

308
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 "This is not what I expected from the porch.

309
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 You got invited, and you're like, 'Don't call me next Tuesday.'"

310
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 I can tell you from right now, it's a hard pass for me.

311
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 So good news, we're going to be back in Colossians next week.

312
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 I won't be here next Tuesday. Kylan will be back.

313
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 You should totally come back next Tuesday.

314
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 But while I'm here, I'm going to keep moving forward, okay?

315
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 That's the reality of porn.

316
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Let's talk about the results of porn.

317
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Here are some results of porn.

318
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 One is it cultivates unrealistic expectations.

319
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 It cultivates unrealistic expectations.

320
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 What's interesting is if you struggle with porn,

321
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 just think about how old were you when you were first introduced to porn.

322
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 The average age is somewhere between the ages of 8 and 13.

323
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 You know what that means?

324
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 It means that you were introduced to porn before you actually got sex ed

325
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 from the public school system.

326
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 And so often, whoever tells us something first becomes the authority.

327
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And so, so many of us grow up thinking that sex is what we have learned through porn.

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 It's like a stand-in sex ed force.

329
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 So we step into marriage thinking that sex is what we've seen in porn,

330
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 or not even marriage.

331
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Like if you enter into--if you're sexually active in your dating relationship,

332
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 there's a good chance that you expect for your sexual experience

333
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 to mimic what you've seen in porn.

334
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 So sex, then, it's all about you.

335
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 It's what you like.

336
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 It's what feels good to you.

337
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 It's about your orgasm.

338
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Porn leads you to believe that your spouse exists to meet your sexual needs.

339
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 What's so interesting is I was doing my research,

340
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and I came across this quote from a porn star.

341
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Listen to what she says.

342
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Some of you are going to be like, "I don't even want to know this."

343
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Here's what she says.

344
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 She says, "Porn actors spend hours in the same position to get the shot.

345
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 You're sore after hours of filming.

346
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Being on set, it's hot.

347
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Your makeup runs, and you get sweaty fast.

348
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 You work long days and long hours filming to create a 15-minute clip of pure perfection."

349
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Do you see what she's saying?

350
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 She's saying none of it's real.

351
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 We spend hours and even days to then splice together 15 minutes

352
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 to create this experience which convinces a generation

353
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 that fantasy is better than reality.

354
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 You know what?

355
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 People in your generation, y'all are dating less.

356
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 You're getting married less.

357
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 You're waiting longer.

358
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Why?

359
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Because so many people in your generation are at home connecting virtually with fantasy.

360
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 It cultivates unrealistic expectations.

361
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Second, it normalizes perverted desires.

362
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 What it does is it convinces you that perverted desires are actually normal.

363
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 There's a rule on the internet.

364
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 It's this unofficial rule, Rule 34, which states that if it exists, there's porn of it, no exceptions.

365
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 What they're saying is, "Hey, if you can dream it, if you can think of it,

366
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 there's probably already porn of it."

367
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 So you know what? There's a reason why when you start looking at porn,

368
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 your appetite grows, your desire for things that are more novel, more intense, more extreme.

369
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 It just begins--it's like a snowball moving down a hill.

370
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 It just grows bigger and bigger and bigger.

371
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Why? Because you have all these videos that are just saying,

372
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 "Yeah, that fantasy that you had, that's actually normal.

373
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 There's actually already a video that exists of it."

374
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And so the searches that people are making,

375
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 like which is so interesting that one of the top searches on Pornhub

376
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 was for cartoon characters that feature cartoons that have both adult features

377
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 and children features.

378
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And what it's doing is it's just normalizing this perversion

379
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 for people to want something that is not real.

380
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Next, it strains and even ruins relationships.

381
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 I have seen marriages dissolve because of pornography.

382
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Studies show that porn use can increase sexual dissatisfaction.

383
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 It increases self-consciousness in women about body image,

384
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 and it increases the probability of divorce.

385
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Some medical professionals have concluded that some people are--

386
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 some men are experiencing porn-induced erectile dysfunction,

387
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 which is--it's this kind of desensitization of men

388
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 that they can only reach the point of feeling stimulated

389
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 when sex is like it is on a movie.

390
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Next, it hinders intimacy with God because the reality is

391
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 that it's hard to just be swimming in sin and intimate with Jesus at the same time.

392
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And if you've convinced yourself that you're close to God

393
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 when you're very close to porn, you can't be close to both at the same time.

394
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 It also hinders impact.

395
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 One of the things that led to a change in my journey with porn

396
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 is I just remember the church that I was attending and serving at,

397
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 I applied to be a Bible study leader, and on the application,

398
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 they asked, "Do you struggle with pornography?"

399
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And I was like, "Of course I do, just like 98% of the other dudes,

400
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 and the other 2%, you should just ask them about their lives."

401
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And then I remember this guy calling me and just saying,

402
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 "TA, we've got to talk about this,

403
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 because it's going to be hard for you to lead a group of guys

404
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 in studying God's Word when you're struggling with this."

405
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And that was a wake-up call that, you know what?

406
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Sin impacts your ministry.

407
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 So those are the results of porn.

408
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 So let's shift gears now to the remedy for porn.

409
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Like, what is the remedy for porn?

410
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Well, at the foundational level, I want to use John 8:32 as the foundation.

411
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 What does it say? Jesus says this. He says,

412
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 "You will know the truth, and the truth will," what?

413
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 "Set you free."

414
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 "You'll know the truth, and the truth will set you free."

415
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And so what I want to do is I'm going to rifle through these things right now.

416
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And it's going to feel like a lot.

417
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 You might need to take notes the best you can,

418
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 and then go back and listen to the message again.

419
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 But there are several things that I want you to know

420
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 that are going to help provide the remedy for your struggle with porn.

421
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And so let me just begin to roll through these.

422
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 One, you need to know God's will.

423
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 And what's great is that Scripture spells it out.

424
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Listen to what Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 3.

425
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 He says, "For this is the will of God."

426
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 So I know that many of you here, because you're young adults,

427
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 there's this wrestle right now with God's will for your life.

428
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Like, "God, who do you want me to marry?

429
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 God, what do you want me to do with my life?

430
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 God, where do you want me to work?

431
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Am I in the right job right now?

432
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Do you even want me living in Dallas?

433
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Is Watermark where you want me coming to church?

434
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Who are my friends going to be?"

435
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And it's all of this wrestle with God.

436
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 "What's your will for my life?

437
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 I need you to open up the heavens and speak audibly

438
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 and just tell me. Is it him? Is it her?

439
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 When's this going to happen?"

440
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 And we can be so consumed with God's unrevealed will

441
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 that we completely ignore His revealed will.

442
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 So just listen to what God spells out for us.

443
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 "For this is the will of God, your sanctification."

444
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 We'll unpack that in a minute.

445
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 "That you do what? That you abstain from sexual immorality."

446
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 That word "sexual immorality" in the Greek,

447
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 it's the Greek word "porneia,"

448
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 which is where we get pornography from.

449
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 "This is the will of God, your sanctification."

450
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 What does "sanctification" mean?

451
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 It means to be set apart.

452
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Listen to how this theologian explained sanctification.

453
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 He says, "By sanctification is meant

454
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 the continued transformation of moral and spiritual character

455
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 so that the believer's life actually comes to mirror

456
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 the standing he or she already has in God's sight."

457
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 So let's hear this.

458
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 So let me say this.

459
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,

460
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 everything I'm talking about right now

461
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 comes with the assumption that you have already come to a place

462
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 where you have realized that in God's eyes,

463
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 without a relationship with Jesus Christ,

464
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 you are, according to the Bible, spiritually dead.

465
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 It's not that you're spiritually bad.

466
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 It's not that you're spiritually sick

467
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 and so you just need to do better and be better

468
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 and try harder and come to church more.

469
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 No, the Bible says that you are spiritually dead.

470
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 What does that mean?

471
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 It means that you are incapable of doing anything

472
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 pleasing to God on your own.

473
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 And the incredible news is that when you could do nothing,

474
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 God did everything, that God in his overwhelming love for you

475
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 sent his Son Christ, that the eternal Son of God

476
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 left heaven and put on flesh in the person of Jesus Christ.

477
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Jesus Christ lived the perfect life you and I could never live.

478
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 He was crucified. He died gruesomely.

479
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 He rose victoriously, conquering all of your sin and all of my sin,

480
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 so that when you put your trust in him,

481
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 he actually puts his Spirit in you.

482
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 God actually lives inside of you,

483
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 and he begins to lead you, and he makes you new.

484
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And so that's where we have to start.

485
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 When Miller to Erickson is talking about sanctification,

486
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 what he's saying is, "Look, if you know Jesus Christ,

487
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 if you've surrendered your life to Jesus Christ,

488
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 then Christ has made you completely holy and pure in God's eyes."

489
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Which is amazing that positionally before God,

490
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 you're not filthy, dirty, packed full of wretched sin.

491
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 No, in God's eyes, you're actually clean and pure and holy.

492
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 But when Paul says that the will of God is sanctification for your life,

493
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 what he's saying is, "God's will is that we would be

494
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 practically what we already are positionally."

495
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 So if positionally in God's eyes, we are pure and holy and clean,

496
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 then God's will is that practically we would begin to live

497
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 pure and holy and clean lives.

498
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 That's God's will.

499
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 The second thing that you need to know is this,

500
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 know God's standard.

501
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 So we've established that God's will for you is to abstain from porneia.

502
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Like, that's spelled out for you.

503
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 If you have any question in you, God made it clear.

504
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 But like, how serious is God about it?

505
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 What I love is that the Bible doesn't leave us guessing.

506
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Like, it's not like, "Well, man, I'm just not like going to Pornhub.

507
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 I'm just like, I'm on Instagram just looking at people's random accounts."

508
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 It's not that big of a deal.

509
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 It's technically not porn.

510
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Well, listen to what God clarifies in Ephesians 5, verse 3.

511
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 He says, "But among you there must not even be a hint of sexual immorality

512
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 or of any kind of impurity or of greed."

513
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Why?

514
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Because these are improper for who?

515
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 For God's holy people.

516
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 He's saying, "Look, because God has made you new and holy,

517
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 it just doesn't make sense for you."

518
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 He's saying, "Not even a hint."

519
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 I was trying to think, like, what are things that have just hints in them?

520
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Well, Tostitos has chips that have a hint of lime.

521
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 You're like, "Oh, man, it's a regular Tostito."

522
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 No, it's not.

523
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 There's that hint of lime.

524
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Or there's like sparkling water where you're like, "It's just a plain Topo Chico."

525
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 And then it's like, "No, it's the one that has the lime in it.

526
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 It's got that hint."

527
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 It's like you barely even notice it, but it's there.

528
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Paul is saying, "Hey, not even like the hint of it.

529
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 It's not like, it's just like it's Instagram."

530
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 No, he's like, "No, not even a hint."

531
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 And it's so interesting the clarity he gives.

532
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 He says, "There shouldn't even be a hint of pornea

533
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 or of any kind of impurity."

534
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 In the Greek, it's the idea of lustful living.

535
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 But then the one that I really appreciate is he says,

536
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 "Or any kind of impurity or of greed."

537
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 So it's kind of like, what is Paul ADD?

538
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 He's like, "Hey, man, no sex and greed."

539
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Let's talk about money.

540
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 It's like, no, that greed he's talking about there, it's a sexual greed.

541
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 It's the idea that you believe other people exist for your own gratification.

542
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 So he's like, "Yeah, when you're at the gym and you see her or you see him

543
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 and you just begin to fantasize like they're not an actual being,

544
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 they actually just exist for your fantasy world."

545
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 He's like, "No, no, no, no, that's a type of greed

546
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 that just doesn't match who you are."

547
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 As God's holy people, know God's standard.

548
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Number three, know God's commands.

549
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Like what does God actually command in the Bible?

550
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 I love this because God spells it out for us.

551
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Like he doesn't toss us the keys to our sexuality and say,

552
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 "I don't know, it's 2024, what do you think?"

553
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 No, he's like, "Let me just spell it out for you.

554
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Know my will. What's my will for your life?

555
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Sanctification, abstain.

556
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 What's my standard? Not even a hint.

557
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 What are my commands? 1 Corinthians 6.18, flee from sexual immorality.

558
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 Flee, like run away.

559
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 It's like you see and you're like, "Nope," and you're out.

560
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 Flee from it.

561
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 In the verb tense in the Greek, it means that you make it your habit to flee.

562
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Flee from sexual immorality, but then y'all talked about it last week,

563
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Colossians 5, put it to death.

564
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Put it to death.

565
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 It's the idea of like cutting off the supply lines.

566
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 When I thought about this, any Stranger Things fans in here?

567
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 Like a few.

568
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 I don't know what you're doing with your life.

569
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Anyway, I love Stranger Things.

570
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 I don't know if that's okay to say, but I really enjoy it.

571
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 I want you to think about Dart.

572
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 You remember Dartanian, Dusty's pet?

573
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 He finds Dart.

574
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 When Dart is just like this small little thing, what does Dusty do?

575
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 He wants to make it his pet.

576
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 When he takes it home, he hides it under his hat.

577
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 He doesn't tell any of his friends about it.

578
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Why?

579
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Because he thinks that Dart is just this cute little friend that he's connected with over at Candy Bar.

580
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Then what does Dart do?

581
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 He murders his cat.

582
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 That's a problem.

583
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 The thing that he was feeding Candy Bar to fed on his cat.

584
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 In the end, the thing that Dusty had made his pet had to die.

585
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 How did Dart die?

586
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 From closing the gate.

587
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 If you haven't seen the show, you'll just have to believe.

588
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 You had to close the gate to the upside down where all of the power was coming from.

589
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 You had to close it.

590
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 You had to cut off the supply line.

591
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 You can't make porn your pet.

592
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 It's like, "You know what? I'm just going to stick it in the aquarium.

593
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 It's contained.

594
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 It's not a problem.

595
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 I can watch all of the shows that are popular right now on Netflix where there's a plethora of sexual scenes.

596
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 It's not a problem.

597
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 I'm just watching this because everyone's talking about it.

598
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 I can sit there and scroll endlessly on Instagram.

599
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 Even though Instagram knows what you want to see, has your algorithm down, begins to consistently make suggestions.

600
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 How about a bout with porn?

601
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 How's that sound right now? 5 p.m.? How about some porn?

602
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 10 p.m.? Porn sound good?

603
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 You have to cut off the supply lines.

604
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 Know God's standards.

605
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Are you willing to forsake comfort and convenience for the sake of freedom?

606
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Next, know God's enabled capacity.

607
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 Know God's enabled capacity.

608
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 Because if you hear me say, "Know God's will, know God's standards, know God's commands,"

609
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 you might be like, "I know them. I know them, and I'm still feeling."

610
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 "TA, you're just making me feel like more of a failure."

611
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 This is where you have to understand how the gospel works in your life.

612
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Know God's enabled capacity.

613
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Last week, y'all talked about the old self and the new self.

614
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 It's like wearing clothes.

615
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 When you're wearing the old self, Bruce Demarest, a theologian, he puts it this way.

616
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 He says, "The old nature is the capacity to serve Satan, sin, and self acquired through Adam,

617
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 whereas the new nature is the capacity to serve God and righteousness acquired through the new birth."

618
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 So let's just be clear.

619
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 You need to understand who you are because of Christ.

620
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Because of what Christ has done, you are completely new,

621
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 which means you have a completely new capacity.

622
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Without Christ, you only have one capacity,

623
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 and that capacity is to serve Satan, sin, and self.

624
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 If you struggle with porn, you're well acquainted with that capacity.

625
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 You're like, "I know my capacity to not want to look at porn ever again,

626
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 and then an hour later, I'm looking at porn."

627
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 You know your capacity really well that, "You know what? Today, I'm going to be strong."

628
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 And then you're scrolling, and it's like, "I'll be strong tomorrow, but tonight I can't be strong."

629
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 But Christ is saying, "Look, you--the biggest lie you can believe

630
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 is that I've saved you, but I haven't changed you."

631
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 And what a lie from the pit of hell that Christ has saved you, but he hasn't changed you.

632
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 The reality is he has made you new, and he sent his spirit.

633
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 God himself lives inside of you, which means you have a new capacity to serve God.

634
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 The theologian Douglas Moo, he says this, he says, "You have been brought into the sphere of God's power."

635
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 Listen to what Paul says in Ephesians 1:18. Don't miss this.

636
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 He says, "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened."

637
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 You know what he's saying? He's saying, "Look, I just want you to see reality."

638
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Like, if you know Jesus, open your eyes.

639
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 See the truth about you.

640
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you,

641
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 the riches of his glorious inheritance and his holy people."

642
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 Watch this. "And his incomparably great power." For who? For us who believe.

643
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 What kind of power is it? Don't miss this.

644
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 "That power is the same as the mighty strength he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead

645
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 and seated him at the right hand in the heavenly realms."

646
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 Do you understand what that's saying?

647
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 It's saying that the same power that raised Jesus Christ from the dead actually lives inside of you.

648
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 Like, do you realize that?

649
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 So, if you're sitting there saying, "I have no hope. There's no way I'll ever be done with porn."

650
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 To say there is no hope is to say that God himself is powerless over your sin.

651
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 Know your God-enabled capacity.

652
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 Next, know your God-given identity.

653
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Know your God-given identity.

654
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 Do you know what my problem was for so long?

655
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 I was a follower of Jesus Christ, and yet I was operating as a stereotypical college guy.

656
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Everyone struggles with porn.

657
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 But that's not the truest thing about you.

658
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 If you know Jesus Christ, you're a child of God.

659
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 Listen to what Paul says in Ephesians 5.1. He says, "Therefore, be imitators of God."

660
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 If we only stop there, then we're like, "Oh, here we go. Thanks for making me feel like a failure.

661
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 How do I imitate God? It's impossible."

662
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 He says, "Therefore, be imitators of God." How?

663
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 As beloved children.

664
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 Your identity should determine your activity.

665
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 I love what Louis Giglio said.

666
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 He said, "Be imitators of God as beloved children."

667
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 If you break down that word "beloved," what two words does it form?

668
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 Be loved.

669
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 You know why so many of us run to porn?

670
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 It's because we're trying to fill a void of love.

671
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 Like, we feel undesirable, unlovable.

672
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 We feel insecure, and so it's just safer.

673
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 It's easier. It pacifies a gnawing pain in our souls.

674
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 That Jesus desperately wants to satisfy.

675
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 If you want to just take a step with porn and freedom from it,

676
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 then start allowing yourself to be loved by God.

677
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 As His child.

678
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 We're His children.

679
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 And then listen to what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6, 19-20.

680
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 He says, "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,

681
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 whom you have from God? You're not your own.

682
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 You've been bought with the price of glorified God in your body."

683
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 Do you know what Paul's saying? He's saying, "You know what?

684
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 Your body, when you put your trust in Christ,

685
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 do you know what it became? It became a temple of the Holy Spirit."

686
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 That word in the Greek, it means that your body is a sacred shrine,

687
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 a sanctuary, or the place where deity dwells.

688
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 So you're not just a stereotypical guy or a stereotypical young adult woman.

689
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 You're a child of God, but you're the temple of God.

690
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 So when you begin to acclimate to your real identity,

691
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 it's like, "Look, no, no, no. I'm a child of God.

692
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 God, how do you want me to interact with porn as your child?

693
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Is this what your children do?

694
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 If I'm your house, if you live in me, is this what we want in your house?

695
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 If I'm your sacred shrine, your sanctuary where you dwell,

696
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 is this what we want to be looking at?"

697
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 It changes your activity.

698
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 And then finally, know your strategy.

699
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 Know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

700
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Know your strategy.

701
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 I would encourage everyone to answer these three questions.

702
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 Here they are.

703
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 What do you need to start? What do you need to stop?

704
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 And who can help?

705
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Someone set their alarm, they're like, "He should be done by now.

706
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 Like, if he's not done by now, I'm going to set my alarm

707
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 and tell him it's time to land that plane, bro.

708
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 Heard, heard.

709
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 Heard, chef, okay."

710
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 Know your strategy.

711
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 Let me just rattle off a few things.

712
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 What do you need to start?

713
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 Let me encourage you, start memorizing Scripture.

714
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 David says this in Psalm 119--or the author of Psalm 119 says,

715
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 "How can a young man keep his way pure?

716
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 By guarding it according to your word."

717
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 When I was making my way out of porn, I slept on a loft bed.

718
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 If that doesn't remind you of college, I don't know what will,

719
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 but I was sleeping on a loft, and I just wrote all these Scriptures

720
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 on note cards, and I taped them above my head,

721
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 so that at night I was just going to bed, meditating on God's Word.

722
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 And when I woke up in the morning, I was just meditating on God's Word.

723
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 And by the power of His Spirit, it began to transform me.

724
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 Begin to memorize Scripture.

725
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 Second, something you might need to start is you might need to start quitting every day.

726
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 Don't quit porn for a lifetime.

727
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 It's too big of a declaration.

728
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 Quit every day.

729
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 Wake up and say, "God, today, today, today,

730
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 would you let me go 24 hours without sinning against you with pornography?"

731
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 I would wake up every morning and just say, "God, today,

732
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 I'm just one step away from looking at porn.

733
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 God, would you fill me with your Spirit?

734
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 Would your standard for purity be my purity?

735
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 And when I'm tempted, would you help me to take the way of escape?"

736
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 Quit every day.

737
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 Number three, rehearse your identity.

738
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 Wake up every morning and say, "God, look, I'm a child.

739
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 I don't want to act like a stereotypical woman, stereotypical male.

740
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 When I'm your child, help me to live like your child."

741
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 Pray constantly.

742
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 Set an alarm to go off every 30 minutes.

743
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 That was an example earlier.

744
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 But set an alarm, and each time it goes off, just pray.

745
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 Say, "God, I'm your child.

746
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 Help me to live like your child right now for the next 30 minutes.

747
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 Would you empower me with the same power that raised Christ from the dead?"

748
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 Next, dignify and humanize those you are tempted by.

749
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 What do I mean by that?

750
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 I mean, when you're scrolling on Instagram and you see someone that you just want to camp out on,

751
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 start praying for them.

752
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 Think about their story.

753
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 That's someone's son or someone's daughter.

754
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 That person is someone that needs the gospel just as much as you need them.

755
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 Who knows what their story is in life?

756
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 Who knows what brokenness they have in their own life that only Jesus can satisfy?

757
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 Start praying for them.

758
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 Dignify them.

759
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 Humanize them.

760
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 They're a real person.

761
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 Get help from friends to lock your phone down.

762
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 Like, dumb your phone down.

763
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 Make it as unsmart as possible.

764
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 And then I'd encourage you to rehearse the consequences.

765
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 This might blow your mind, but after 19 years of being free from porn,

766
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 I still get tempted to look at porn.

767
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 Isn't that crazy?

768
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 Like, the other day I was going to be in a hotel room by myself,

769
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 and I was like, "Man, it'd be so nice to look at porn tonight."

770
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 It's been 19 years, and I thought, "Man, it'd be so nice to look at porn tonight."

771
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 But now the conversation in my head is, "That's not even an option.

772
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 It's not even an option."

773
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 If I look at porn, I'm going to feel like a failure because God has done so much for me.

774
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 That'd be a rejection of His love.

775
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 I'm going to have to tell my wife that this is what I chose to do when I'm away from her.

776
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 I'm going to have to tell my kids that this is what their dad was doing when dad was away from you guys.

777
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 I'm going to have to come to church and tell elders here, like,

778
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 "Hey, let me just tell you, you can't trust me when I travel."

779
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 So one of the things you can do is just rehearse the consequences.

780
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 You know what you're going to realize?

781
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 It's just not worth it.

782
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 Just look at the backside of porn.

783
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 Just look at the backside.

784
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 Just walk around and look at the backside of that 15 minutes of looking, that orgasm,

785
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 and then reality comes into view.

786
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 It's like, "Well, there we go. Starting over again."

787
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 Just rehearse the consequences.

788
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 What do you need to stop?

789
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 You might need to stop looking at social media.

790
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 Some of you are like, "No, please, not that."

791
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 Your phone knows what you want to see.

792
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 Stop streaming ranch of shows.

793
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 Get rid of those streaming services altogether.

794
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 Make more time for reading, exercising, and being with godly friends.

795
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 I promise you, you'll experience more life and joy and energy.

796
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 And then who can help?

797
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 Answer that question, who can help?

798
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 If you're like, "I don't have anyone to help."

799
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 Monday nights, regeneration.

800
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 Right here in this room, 630.

801
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 Regeneration.

802
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 It is for people just like you and me,

803
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 who are trying to pursue freedom from all different things in life.

804
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 We'd love to have you here.

805
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 Commit to walking in the light with a couple of friends.

806
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 Text some friends before you leave tonight.

807
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 If you're here with some friends, just be honest with them.

808
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 Say, "Look, I need your help."

809
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 But answer those three questions.

810
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 What do you need to stop?

811
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 What do you need to start?

812
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 And who can help?

813
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 Now I'll just close by saying,

814
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 "Look, maybe for some of you, the place to start is just by surrendering your life to Jesus."

815
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 Maybe you're sitting there saying,

816
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 "Look, you're telling me that even after struggling with porn for 5 years, 10 years, 15 years,

817
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 God would still want me to be his child?

818
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 Absolutely.

819
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 You're telling me after I've spent all this time using my body to look at porn,

820
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 to masturbate to porn,

821
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 you're telling me that God would even think about coming to live inside of me?

822
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 Absolutely.

823
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 Because that's what a good God does.

824
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 The God of heaven and earth looked upon us.

825
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 And in his love,

826
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 he sent his Son.

827
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 And Jesus Christ has come to rescue you and me,

828
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 to free you and me.

829
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 So that we could move from free porn to being porn free.

830
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 So that we could have hope.

831
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 So that we could have peace.

832
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 So that we could have joy.

833
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 So that we could find our deepest satisfaction in the one that we were made for, Jesus Christ.

834
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 If that's you tonight,

835
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 maybe God brought you here to hear a talk on the most random topic in your mind,

836
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 and yet he brought you here to just say,

837
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 "Look, tonight you're going to be mine.

838
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
 I want you in my family.

839
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 I want you to be my child.

840
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 I want you to experience all of my love, all of my forgiveness tonight."

841
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 Let's pray together.

842
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 And so,

843
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
 look, I know I've gone long tonight,

844
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 but I'm going to ask you to engage in this moment for a minute.

845
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 If you're here tonight, and look, I'm not trying to tweak emotions.

846
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 I don't want anyone doing anything that isn't real right now.

847
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
 This is just an opportunity for those who are sitting there like,

848
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 "God's doing something in my life."

849
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 If you're here tonight,

850
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 and you just sense that God is just saying,

851
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 "Tonight you're going to be mine.

852
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 Tonight I want you to give your life to me."

853
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 God is inviting you to put your trust in him,

854
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 to receive Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.

855
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 Just with your eyes closed, would you slip up your hand tonight

856
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 so I know exactly who I'm talking to in this place tonight?

857
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
 Okay, if that's you, then let me just ask you,

858
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 right now, to tell God what you believe to be true.

859
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 You just say, "God, I believe that you sent Jesus to die for me.

860
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 I believe that Christ conquered sin for me.

861
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 I want Jesus to be my Lord and Savior."

862
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 Just tell him, say, "God, I give my life to you tonight.

863
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 I surrender my life to you tonight."

864
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 And then I want to...

865
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 I just want to ask some people here,

866
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
 maybe you've been struggling with porn for a long time,

867
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 and you've never told anyone.

868
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 You don't have to do this if you're struggling with porn.

869
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 I just want to give it as an opportunity.

870
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
 Maybe you just need to be known for a minute.

871
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 Maybe this is just between you, me, and God.

872
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 If you're sitting there just saying,

873
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 "Look, for the first time, I just need to be known.

874
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 I'm ready to be done with this.

875
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
 I'm tired of this. I'm tired of the secrecy."

876
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 If that's you, it would just be helpful for you,

877
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
 with everyone's eyes closed, to slip up your hand and just say,

878
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
 "Yeah, you're talking to me. I'm tired of this.

879
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
 I've never told anyone about this,

880
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
 but I just need to be known right now in this moment,

881
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 at least by God and that guy on the stage.

882
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 Porn is kind of my deal right now."

883
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
 Just put your hand up real quick.

884
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 If that's you, I just want to invite you right now to just say,

885
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 "God, I know you see me.

886
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
 I'm just going to trust that you love me

887
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 and that you're for me

888
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 and that there's hope for me.

889
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:03,000
 Would you give me hope today?"

890
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 We're going to sing in a minute.

891
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 It's going to just be an opportunity for you to respond.

892
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 If you need to get on your knees to confess before the Lord, you can.

893
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
 If you want to stand and praise and gratitude

894
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
 that God has moved you towards freedom,

895
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 if you need to sit there and text a friend to just say,

896
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 "Look, I need your help," there's just a space to respond.

897
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
 And so I pray, Lord God, I pray I speak the name of Jesus

898
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 over this room tonight and the power that is found solely in his name,

899
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
 Lord, I pray that there would be a movement among young adults

900
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 in Dallas, Texas, and all over this nation

901
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 of young adults just saying, "Look, Jesus is better.

902
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 I want Jesus. I want freedom."

903
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
 So Lord, would you come and move in our lives tonight?

904
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
 We need you and love you.

905
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:05,000
