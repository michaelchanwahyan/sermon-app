[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.020]   [Music]
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.860]   [Music]
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.860]   >> Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.360]   We doing all right tonight?
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.020]   Great to see you.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.760]   Thanks for making it out to all of our Porch Live locations.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.860]   We're so glad you're streaming with us.
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.760]   Hey, really excited for tonight.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760]   First, I'll just say this because some of you in the room
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.300]   are here for the very first time.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.060]   And you're probably wondering what this is.
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.280]   And so it's helpful for me to look at you
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.640]   and just give you a little background on who we are.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   The Porch exists to call any and every young adult
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.480]   to see Jesus and surrender fully to life with him.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.320]   That's who we are.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.920]   That's what you're a part of tonight.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.360]   And when we say any and every young adult, we mean it.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   We really do.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.980]   I was talking to the Lord earlier this morning
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.980]   and I was like, God, I know that your heart is one
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.400]   where you want saints and sinners and skeptics
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.960]   and seekers to all gather into this space.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.560]   So if you're here and you have questions,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.500]   you're in the right place.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.160]   If you're here and you've been walking with the Lord
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.400]   for a long time, you're in the right place.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.280]   And if you're here by mistake,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.280]   I promise you're in the right place.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.840]   So we're really glad that you would join us
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.680]   here this evening.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.820]   And I'm really excited for where we're going
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.840]   because tonight we have a very special guest
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.220]   in the room with us for the second time this year.
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.260]   We've got Mr. Nate Hilgenkamp in the house.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.660]   Give it up for Nate, if you would.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.760]   Nate is one of the teaching pastors at Harris Creek.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.240]   He's a co-host of Becoming Something podcast.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.600]   But way more than all of that, that's awesome.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.000]   Nate's just an incredible human being.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.660]   Like he's someone that we dearly love here at the Ports
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.640]   that I'm grateful to call a really good friend.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.360]   And I genuinely believe,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.900]   and I need y'all to hear me when I say this,
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.380]   'cause I'm not just paying him empty lip service.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.720]   I genuinely believe is one of the leading voices
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.740]   when it comes to Bible teaching for our generation.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.340]   And so we're really blessed to have you here, man.
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.300]   Thanks for making the time to join us tonight.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.660]   Would y'all do a great job of welcoming
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.140]   Nate Hilgenkamp to the stage.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.700]   (congregation applauding)
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.540]   - Thank you, brother. - Appreciate you.
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.200]   - Love you, brother.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.060]   Well, I wanna start with this.
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.620]   Recently, my wife and I, we had a disagreement
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.780]   that's still unresolved.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.960]   And I thought, you know,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.000]   there's no better way to resolve this conflict
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.960]   than to let you decide who was right or wrong,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.720]   which is just great marriage advice.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.360]   Like whenever you and your wife disagree,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.800]   you and your husband disagree someday,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.960]   just ask other people who's right or wrong.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.320]   So would you help me out?
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.800]   I'm gonna tell you what the disagreement was
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.360]   and let me know who was right or wrong.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.760]   The disagreement was this.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.580]   I saw a picture of a shoe online
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.960]   and the disagreement we had over this shoe
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.980]   wasn't whether or not this shoe was cool.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.480]   The disagreement we had was over the color of this shoe.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.640]   So I think we've got a picture of it.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.580]   Check out this shoe.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.720]   So I've got a question.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.800]   How many of you, how many of you like me
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.600]   see this shoe and you see it as teal and gray?
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.640]   Keep those hands raised.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.100]   Those are the saved people in the room tonight.
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.860]   Now how many of you, like my wife,
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.140]   see that shoe and see it as pink and white?
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.740]   Crazy, crazy.
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.940]   Like this makes no sense to me.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.340]   How can it be that all of us are looking at the same thing
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.780]   and see two different things?
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.020]   Now let me tell you who's right.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.040]   Let me tell you who's right
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.820]   because I did some research on this
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.840]   'cause I couldn't believe it.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.660]   My wife saw one thing, I saw a different thing
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.900]   and it just blew my mind so I did a lot of research
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.900]   and I found out that Vans, the type of shoe that is,
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.660]   they don't make a teal and gray shoe.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.820]   So unfortunately my wife was right.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.020]   They are pink and white.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.740]   And you see, it just blew my mind.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.420]   Like I think it just has blown yours.
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.440]   Like how can two people look at the same thing
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.720]   and come to two very different conclusions?
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.080]   And as I've been thinking about that,
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.240]   I've realized this happens all the time,
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.600]   that two people look at the exact same thing
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.880]   and come away with two different conclusions.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.260]   The thing is most of the time,
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.880]   it's not just about the color of a shoe.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.440]   Like that's a very low cost to get wrong.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.700]   But there's a lot of other situations
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.080]   where two people look at the same thing
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.460]   and they come to two different conclusions.
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.420]   For example, maybe you've had two people in your life
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.660]   each go through a breakup
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.700]   and they each saw it very differently.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.100]   One of them goes through a breakup
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.420]   and they see that breakup and they go,
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.020]   this is the worst thing that has ever happened to me.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.300]   I'm unlovable, I'm undesirable.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.580]   The other person can go through a breakup,
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.180]   see that breakup and go, this is really, really hard.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.300]   And yet I know I'm still loved.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.060]   I know I'm still desired
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.380]   and I can't wait to see what happens next.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.100]   You see, how can two people each see the same thing
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.900]   and come to two very different conclusions?
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.860]   And here's how, and I'm just gonna give away my message.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.300]   It all comes down to who you trust.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.420]   Who you trust changes the lens you view your life through.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.320]   Who you trust changes the conclusions
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.540]   that you will come to in your life.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.600]   And I just want you to know tonight, Porgs,
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.220]   most people will come to the wrong conclusion.
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.500]   Most people will see their life the wrong way.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.000]   Friends, I just don't want that to be you.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.100]   So tonight, what we're gonna do
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.820]   is we're gonna do a little study of scripture
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.420]   to try to figure out how we can see things in our life
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.860]   the right way.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.060]   And we're gonna do that by opening up the word of God
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.040]   to the book of Numbers.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.700]   Kylan said I could teach on really anything
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.460]   and I'm like, let's do the book of Numbers.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.900]   I bet they haven't listened to that or read that in a while.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.420]   So the book of Numbers is the number four book
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.940]   in the Bible, Numbers 13 and 14
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.980]   is where we're gonna be Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.740]   And we're gonna read a story
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.120]   where 12 men all saw the same thing,
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.820]   but they didn't all come to the same conclusion.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.100]   12 men saw the same thing,
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.500]   they didn't come to the same conclusion.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.540]   So Numbers chapter 13, that's where we're gonna be.
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.500]   And just to set up where we're at in the book of Numbers,
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.020]   because I bet a lot of you are like, man,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.640]   I have no idea what's going on
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.500]   leading up to this point in scripture.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.380]   Well, Numbers 13 is about a year and a half
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.120]   after the Exodus.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.100]   So the Exodus was whenever the Israelites
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.100]   were enslaved in Egypt,
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.380]   God appeared to a man named Moses and he said,
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.100]   Moses, I'm going to use you to lead my people
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.300]   up out of slavery and into freedom.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.860]   So Moses goes to Pharaoh and says,
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.180]   let God's people go and Pharaoh says, no.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.140]   So what happens next is God brings plague
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.360]   after plague after plague upon Pharaoh and the Egyptians
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.360]   until finally Pharaoh says, okay, fine, get out of here.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.080]   And as the Israelites are getting out of there,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.960]   they come up against the sea.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.320]   And once they're up against the sea,
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.560]   they think they're free only to turn around
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.880]   and see that Pharaoh had changed his mind.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.280]   And Pharaoh and his armies are tracking them down
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.720]   and they're up against the sea and they go,
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.920]   Moses, we're gonna die.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.720]   And then Moses goes to God and says,
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.120]   God, have you brought us out here to die?
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.160]   And God says, absolutely not.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.740]   So he splits the sea and the Israelites
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.420]   walk through on dry ground.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.860]   And then the Egyptians pursue them into the sea.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.800]   God closes the sea and then they perish in that sea.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.540]   So the Israelites walk onto the other side of the sea
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.300]   only to appear in a desert.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.340]   So this isn't like some exciting type of freedom.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.780]   They're like, man, we want to go back to Egypt
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.260]   because we have no food to eat here.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.580]   So they go, Moses, have you brought us out here to die?
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.940]   And Moses goes to God and he goes,
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.080]   God, have you brought us out here to die?
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.180]   And God says, absolutely not.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.440]   And then he provides manna, which was a form of bread
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.880]   every single day for them in this desert.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.000]   Then they continue to journey through the desert
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.760]   and we pick up on this story when they're on the edge
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.480]   of what we know as the promised land.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.660]   The land that God had promised them way back in Egypt
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.740]   that he would eventually give to them.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.680]   So they're standing on the edge of this promised land
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.680]   looking over into it and Moses decides to do one thing.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.540]   He takes 12 men, 12 men from each of the 12 tribes of Israel
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.340]   in Genesis, there was a man named Jacob,
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.820]   later renamed Israel.
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.660]   He had 12 sons and Moses picked 12 men
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.040]   from the 12 tribes of Israel and sends them
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.960]   into the promised land as spies.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.460]   And he tells them, figure out all you possibly can
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.300]   about this land.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.480]   Survey the people of the land,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.880]   survey the cities in this land,
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.120]   survey the fruit of this land, the terrain of this land.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.640]   We want to know everything we possibly can about this land.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.680]   So these men go into the promised land
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.640]   and spend 40 days in this land.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   And they look at the people, they look at the terrain,
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.320]   they look at the cities and they even cut down some fruit.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.680]   In fact, scripture says in Numbers chapter 13
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.440]   that they cut down clusters of grapes,
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.040]   but the grapes were so large,
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.480]   they had to carry them back on poles,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.500]   which sounds like an exaggeration.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.640]   But here's a picture of the clusters of grapes
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.440]   grown in this region today.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.520]   It is like the perfect region for growing grapes
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.600]   and other fruits.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.220]   So these are the types of clusters
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.440]   that they're bringing back to the people of God.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.460]   It also says that they cut down pomegranates
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.160]   and figs as well.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.920]   And after surveying this promised land for 40 days,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.440]   they come back with a report for the people of God.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.780]   And they say this in Numbers 13, verse 26.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.780]   They came back to Moses and Aaron
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.840]   and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.640]   in the desert of Paran.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.360]   There they reported to them and the whole assembly
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.380]   and showed them the fruit of the land.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.660]   They gave Moses this account.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.320]   We went into the land which you sent us
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.740]   and it does flow with milk and honey.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.280]   In fact, here's its fruit.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.900]   But the people who live there are powerful
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.320]   and the cities are fortified and very large.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.280]   We even saw the descendants of Anak there.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.060]   The Amalekites live in the Negev.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.600]   The Hittites, Jebusites, Amorites live in the hill country
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.780]   and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.080]   So they go, this land is amazing.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.580]   There's pomegranates and figs and grapes
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.120]   and it's flowing with milk and honey.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.620]   Like the land itself is phenomenal,
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.520]   but there's some really, really big bad guys there.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.920]   And I don't think they want us to live there.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.740]   So we shouldn't try to live there.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.040]   And the people of God, the Israelites,
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.600]   they're all thrown into a panic.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.520]   And this happens next in verse 30.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.660]   Then Caleb, who was one of the other spies,
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.980]   silenced the people before Moses.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.600]   And he said, we should go up
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   and take possession of the land,
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.740]   for we can certainly do it.
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.760]   Now the other spies, they start to get nervous
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.100]   that the people might believe Caleb's report
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.140]   over their reports.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.500]   They just start to make stuff up
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.520]   about the land that they've just seen.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.860]   They say this next.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.140]   But the man who had gone up with him said,
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.420]   we can't attack those people.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.180]   They are stronger than we are.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.580]   And they spread among the Israelites
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.380]   a bad report about the land they had explored.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.620]   They said the land we explored devours those living in it.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.780]   Not the people, but the land.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.920]   It'll just swallow you alive if you go in.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.980]   All the people we saw there are of great size.
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.860]   Or your translation may even say we're giants.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.100]   We saw the Nephilim there.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.100]   The descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim.
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.100]   And we seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.860]   And we looked the same to them.
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.140]   So they go, guys, trust us.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.820]   We cannot do this.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.660]   Don't listen to Caleb.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.580]   This land is gonna kill us.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.020]   The people will kill us.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.020]   We've spent 40 days there.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.480]   We've seen it all.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.580]   We don't want to go into this land
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.380]   because this land is not best for us.
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.320]   Now my question after reading this text is this.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.460]   How can 12 men all see the same thing
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.100]   and come to two different conclusions?
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.380]   10 of them see this land and they come back saying,
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.540]   we've got a really, really bad report.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.060]   Two of them, Caleb, and we'll later see Joshua,
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.340]   comes back and they say,
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.500]   no, we've got a really, really good report.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.940]   How can it be that 12 men saw the same things?
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.420]   They all saw the same people.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.180]   They all saw the same cities.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.900]   They all saw the same terrain.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.580]   They all saw the same fruit.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.940]   And yet they came to two very different conclusions.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.460]   How is that?
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.820]   Well, it's 'cause they weren't looking at the same thing.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.320]   You see, 10 men, all they were looking at was a problem.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.700]   Two men, all they were looking at was a promise.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.180]   10 men, all they were looking at was the giants in the land.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.300]   Two of the men were just looking at the God
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.300]   who was overseeing this land.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.460]   And here's how they came to two different conclusions.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.260]   And it's the first thing we can learn tonight.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.760]   Point number one, who you trust
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.140]   changes how you perceive your problem.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.820]   Who you trust changes how you perceive your problem.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.980]   And this is important for us
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.060]   because all of us are gonna have problems in our life.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.340]   Well, like problems are inevitable.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.180]   We're gonna have health problems.
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.180]   We're gonna have job problems.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.420]   We're gonna have relationship problems.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.400]   We're gonna have family problems.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.820]   We're gonna have financial problems.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.780]   Problems in this life are inevitable.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.340]   The right perspective of those problems is not.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.700]   And these 10 men came to the wrong conclusion.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.220]   And I wanna show you from the text again
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.860]   what it looked like.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.140]   At the end of their report,
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.140]   after they saw all these really big, bad people,
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.300]   they come to this conclusion.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.260]   We just read this in verse 33, and they said this.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260]   We seem like grasshoppers in our own eyes
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.980]   and we look the same to them.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.900]   So they go, in light of our problem,
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.180]   we seem really, really small.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.800]   They're going, y'all, we stood back to back
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.820]   against these guys and we look like grasshoppers
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.660]   compared to them.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.700]   They're gonna ruin us.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.460]   Now, the thing is, they were actually right
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.420]   in assessing the difficulty.
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.980]   History shows that the people in the land were strong.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.140]   The armies were large.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.540]   The cities were fortified.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.780]   Like, they technically came to the right conclusion.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.540]   There was a real problem.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.220]   But why did these 10 men come to a different conclusion
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.180]   than the other two?
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.060]   And it's because of this.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.980]   They looked at their problem
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.620]   and they compared their problem to their power,
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.460]   while they should have compared their problem
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.140]   to God's power.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.820]   Because this text says, in light of our problem,
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.700]   we seem like grasshoppers.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.760]   When they should have gone, in light of my God,
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.340]   this problem looks like a grasshopper to him.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.260]   Because you see, while we stand no chance
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.780]   on our own against this army,
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.900]   this army stands no shot against my God.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.160]   And you see, they came to the wrong conclusion
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.500]   of this problem because they thought
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.940]   that this problem was their problem to solve.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.740]   It was never about them.
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.420]   It was about someone else.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.820]   And just to illustrate it another way,
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.300]   let's imagine if today, rather than driving up I-35,
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.500]   I got on a plane from Waco to Dallas.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.180]   I hopped on an American Eagle flight
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.820]   from Waco to the DFW airport.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.580]   And let's just say I got in my seat, 14B,
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.020]   and I settled down before the flight takes off,
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.660]   and I get really, really nervous.
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.540]   And I start going, "Oh my word.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.500]   "Like, this is gonna be a nightmare.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.580]   "I've never taken a single hour of pilot classes.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.340]   "I didn't go to flight school.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.960]   "Like, how in the world is this plane
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.860]   "gonna get from Waco to Dallas?"
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.160]   Why would that be a ridiculous thing to think?
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.580]   Because that wasn't my job.
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.900]   My job was to sit there and allow the other person,
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.780]   the pilots, who were there to take me
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.100]   from one place to the next.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.340]   I didn't have to worry that I didn't have what it took
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.680]   because I know someone else had what it took.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.620]   This is what's going on in this text.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.220]   They're going, "How are we gonna get
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.740]   "from this place to another place?"
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.260]   And meanwhile, there's another guy in this story.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.100]   There's another God.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.460]   There's a God in this story going,
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.860]   "Hey, it's not about you.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.700]   "It's about me.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.180]   "I'm the one who promised we'd take you there."
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.900]   In fact, this is how this chapter starts
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.180]   in Numbers chapter 13.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.100]   Just to show you this, it says this.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.520]   The Lord said to Moses,
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.120]   "Send some men to explore the land of Canaan
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.980]   "to see if you can overtake it."
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.340]   And that's not what it says.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.120]   It says, "Send some men to explore the land of Canaan,
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.620]   "which I am giving to the Israelites."
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.420]   He's going, "You don't need to send spies in
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.160]   "to determine whether or not you can do it.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.220]   "You don't need to take a vote.
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.560]   "I've already decided what I'm gonna do.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.300]   "This isn't up to you.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.680]   "It's up to me."
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.660]   But then the spies go in and they come back
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.240]   and 10 of them say,
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.000]   "But guys, the Canaanites live there.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.080]   "And the Hittites live there.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.180]   "And the Jebusites live there."
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.180]   And God's going, "Yeah, I already told you that they did."
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.600]   In fact, he told them this in Exodus chapter three.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.660]   Just to read it for you, this is what it says.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.800]   As he's promising them the promised land, he goes,
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.160]   "And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.360]   "in Egypt and into the land of the Canaanites,
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.060]   "Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hittites, and Jebusites,
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.660]   "a land flowing with milk and honey."
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.260]   So I think God's looking at these spies and he's going,
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.440]   "All you've done on this super secret mission
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.900]   "is figure out what I already told you."
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.900]   You came back saying,
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.420]   "Hey guys, it's a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.260]   "I already told you that."
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.740]   You came back saying, "The Jebusites and Hittites
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.940]   "and the Canaanites live there."
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.220]   "Yeah, I already told you that."
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.380]   But they also go,
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.000]   "But we cannot enter into this land."
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.500]   And God goes, "Oh, no, buddy.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.460]   "I already told you that you would."
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:21.920]   And you see, here's how Caleb came to the correct conclusion.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.520]   Here's how his perspective differed from the other 10.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.400]   He made a decision to focus on God's promise
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.600]   rather than his problem.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.640]   And he decided that he was gonna trust what God said
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.520]   rather than what he saw.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.280]   And Caleb here goes,
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.920]   "Hey guys, I see the same problem that you do.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.240]   "I saw the same cities, I saw the same army,
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.620]   "I saw the same people.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.340]   "I'm not ignoring your problem.
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.320]   "I'm not ignoring this problem.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.720]   "The only difference though between me and you is
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.120]   "I'm not ignoring my God.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.320]   "And I just know that even though it seems like
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.800]   "it'd be really, really hard for us to overtake this land,
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.080]   "he's told us that we are going to overtake this land.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.560]   "So if he said it, I'm just gonna believe it."
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.960]   And that's what faith is.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.840]   Faith is simply believing that God is telling the truth.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.480]   And that's how Caleb came to the right conclusion.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.060]   So to summarize this point,
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.320]   there are two ways of looking at this problem.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.160]   The first is we are really, really small.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.700]   This enemy is really, really big,
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.260]   therefore we're gonna lose.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.720]   The second is we are really, really small.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.960]   This enemy is really, really big.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.240]   Therefore, I can't wait to see what God's gonna do.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.880]   Because if he said it, I'm gonna believe it.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.000]   And I'm just gonna sit back, put on my seatbelt,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.980]   and watch this thing take off.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.360]   Because I'm trusting him, I'm not trusting me.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.480]   And it's the first thing that we can learn from this point.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.240]   Who you trust changes how you perceive your problem.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.720]   Okay, let's flip over to chapter 14.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.920]   We just finished reading chapter 13.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.960]   Let's see what happens next.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.660]   The people of God have just received a bad report
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.600]   from the majority and a good report from the minority.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.400]   And let's see who they choose to listen to.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.760]   It says this, chapter 14, verse one.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.960]   "That night, all the members of the community
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.580]   "raised their voices and wept aloud.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.020]   "All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron,
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.680]   "and the whole assembly said to them,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.040]   "if only we had died in Egypt or in this wilderness.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.140]   "Why is the Lord bringing us to this land
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.080]   "only to let us fall by the sword?"
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.560]   That right there is an accusation
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.520]   against the character of God.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.560]   They're going, God wants us to die.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.480]   And more than that, He wants our wives and children
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.360]   to be taken as plunder.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.340]   "Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.640]   And they said to each other,
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.480]   "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt."
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.640]   Then Moses and Aaron fell face down
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.400]   in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.120]   Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh,
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.840]   who were among those who explored the land,
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   tore their clothes.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.720]   And in that day, this was a sign of grief and mourning.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.640]   And he said to the entire Israelite assembly,
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.760]   "The land we passed through and explored
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.540]   "is exceedingly good.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.720]   "If the Lord is pleased with us,
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.920]   "He will lead us into that land."
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.600]   And if you notice, the other 10's report
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.440]   makes no mention of God.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.540]   Here they say, "No, the Lord will lead us into a land
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.160]   "flowing with milk and honey, and He will give it to us.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.760]   "Only do not rebel against the Lord
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.760]   "and do not be afraid of the people of this land
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.080]   "because we will devour them."
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.240]   I love this next phrase.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:25.140]   "Their protection is gone, but the Lord is with us.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.600]   "Do not be afraid of them,
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.320]   "but the whole assembly talked about stoning them."
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.480]   Which that sounds extreme, but here's what's going on there.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.280]   They're thinking, "Hey, we're gonna kill you guys
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.140]   "before you kill us.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.660]   "Because Caleb and Joshua, if we listen to you,
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.000]   "we're gonna die.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.320]   "So we're gonna put you to death
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.400]   "before you put us to death."
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.240]   Then this happens next.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.540]   "Then the glory of the Lord appeared
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.700]   "at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.640]   "And the Lord appears and is angry with the people,
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.880]   "and He says, 'How long until you trust me?
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.540]   "What else do I gotta do?'"
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:06.280]   In your life right now, what else does He gotta do?
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.760]   I mean, think about the history lesson I gave you
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.000]   before we jumped into this text.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.440]   Think about it specifically for the Israelites.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.880]   Think about what they saw God do.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.040]   They were enslaved in Egypt,
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.640]   thought they would die in Egypt,
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.580]   and God brought them up out of slavery and into freedom.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.080]   God did it.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.040]   And then they're standing on the banks of the sea,
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.160]   thinking that they're gonna get overtaken again,
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.320]   thinking that they're gonna die,
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.480]   only for God to make a way,
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.640]   and they walk through on dry ground.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.040]   God did it.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.200]   And then they're in the desert,
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.760]   thinking that they're gonna die once again
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.800]   because there is no food,
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.720]   and then manna is provided for them every single day.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.440]   God did it.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.900]   And here, once again, they're going,
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.800]   "We don't think God will do it."
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.300]   And God's going, "What else do I need to do?"
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.600]   Friend, what else does He need to do for you,
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.500]   for you to trust Him?
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.480]   And here, this time, He says that their disbelief
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.420]   is deserving of punishment.
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.260]   And skipping ahead to verse 19,
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.740]   Moses goes to God and says,
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.180]   "In accordance with your great love,
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.340]   forgive the sins of these people,
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.660]   just as you have pardoned them
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.460]   from the time they left Egypt until now."
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.140]   And the Lord replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.300]   Nevertheless, as surely as I live,
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.660]   and as surely as the glory of the Lord
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.880]   fills the whole earth,
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.740]   not one of those who saw my glory
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.440]   in the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness,
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.900]   but who disobeyed me and tested me 10 times,
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.140]   not one of them will ever see the land I promised
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.500]   on oath to their ancestors,
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.500]   and no one who has treated me with contempt
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.440]   will ever see it."
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.060]   And since they disbelieved God,
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.300]   they were sentenced to wander in the desert for 40 years,
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.500]   and not a single person who disbelieved God
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.720]   got to see the power of God,
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.260]   as he could have brought them into the promised land.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.100]   And this is point number two,
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.580]   second thing we can learn.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.700]   Disbelief will make you miss out on what God can do.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.980]   Disbelief will make you miss out on what God can do.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.800]   You see, if they would have just believed God,
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.120]   they would have gotten to see God
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.600]   bring them into the promised land.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.620]   But since they didn't,
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.700]   they spent the rest of their life in the desert,
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.300]   and they died in the desert,
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.420]   and their disbelief had consequences.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.840]   And if we're to look at this story
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.820]   and learn all we possibly can about this story,
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.460]   and learn all we possibly can about the character and person
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.540]   of God, I think we can learn this from this story.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.820]   And it's this, our disbelief has consequences.
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.960]   If we spend our life disbelieving God,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.100]   there will be things in our life
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.100]   that we will miss out on simply because we didn't believe
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.580]   that they could actually happen,
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.640]   because our disbelief has consequences.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.980]   Now, I also wanna be clear that I do not believe
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.900]   that every single consequence in your life
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.620]   is a result of disbelief.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.140]   Not every pain in your life,
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.580]   or every challenge in your life is a result of disbelief.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.980]   But I do believe that disbelief has consequences
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.900]   because disbelief will make you miss out
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.100]   on what God can do.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.460]   And here, their disbelief had a consequence.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.860]   And this consequence was for them
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.580]   to wander in the desert for 40 years.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.620]   You ever wonder why?
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.140]   Well, like if you grew up in church,
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.300]   maybe you've heard this story a lot.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.500]   You know, the Israelites, they were enslaved,
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.780]   and then they got into freedom,
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.340]   but then they had to wander in the desert for 40 years.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.340]   Why did God make them wander in the desert for 40 years?
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.140]   Like, that feels like a really extreme punishment
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.620]   based on this scenario.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.180]   Why did God say, okay, you're going to have to wander
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.580]   in the desert for 40 years?
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.300]   Here's why.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.860]   It's because they asked for it.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.020]   This is what they wanted.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:39.060]   And in fact, this is what we actually just read in the text.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.340]   Let's read it again.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.460]   Look at what the Israelites said to God.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.540]   They said, "All the Israelites grumbled
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.720]   "against Moses and Aaron,
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.540]   "and the whole assembly said to them,
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.460]   "if only we had died in Egypt or in this wilderness."
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.420]   So God's going, I want to lead you into a promised land.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.140]   And they go, we don't want to go into the promised land.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.820]   We either want to die in Egypt or we want to die here.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.100]   And God's going, well,
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.620]   you're certainly not going back to Egypt.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.460]   So if you want to die here, go for it.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.620]   And he just gave them what they asked for.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.820]   Why did they ask for this?
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.460]   Like what a lame request of the Lord.
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.700]   Why did they ask for the wilderness?
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.620]   Here's why they asked for the wilderness.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.620]   Because the wilderness was safe.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.420]   This is what they knew.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.700]   And what they knew was good enough.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.460]   Ports, I don't know about you.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.780]   I don't think we serve a God of the good enough.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.300]   I think we serve a God who's able to abundantly more
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.060]   than all we ask or imagine.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.860]   So we don't need to go, God just keep me safe
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.180]   because he can do still more.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:52.500]   And I want to show you two things
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.860]   that are really, really important here.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.260]   And two implications for this on your life.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:01.940]   See, not only did these 10 men, these 10 spies
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.500]   miss out on what God could do through their life.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:10.380]   They caused many, many, many, many others
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:15.180]   to miss out on what God could do in their life as well.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.180]   You see, these 10 men came back with a report of disbelief
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.260]   and this disbelief was contagious
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.700]   and it got on the people of God.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.140]   And as they received this disbelief from these 10 men,
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.980]   it caused them to miss out on what God could do
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.700]   in and through their life.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.780]   And that right there has two implications in your life.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:38.380]   The first of this, who you hang out with really matters.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.780]   Who you hang out with really matters
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.980]   because what they either believe or disbelieve about God
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.380]   is likely getting off on you
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.500]   because belief or disbelief is contagious.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.780]   So think about the people in your life.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.340]   Like are the people in your life the 10 or the two?
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.340]   Are they the people in your life who are coming back
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.100]   saying God can't do it?
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.100]   It's too big, it's too challenging.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.580]   Oh, you're always gonna struggle with that.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.060]   Oh, that's never gonna change.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.220]   Or are the people in your life the two going,
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.740]   hey, God can do it.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.340]   He said he would and if he said he would,
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.180]   then I believe he can.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.900]   Of course God would.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.900]   Are the people in your life the 10 or the two?
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.540]   Are they the disbelieving, critical, cynical people?
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.660]   And if they are, I just want you to know
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.180]   that they are likely causing you to miss out
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.140]   on what God can do in and through your life.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.340]   And if that's cool with you, keep hanging out with the 10.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.700]   But for me, I wanna be found with the two
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.060]   because I wanna see all that God can do
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.540]   in and through my life.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.780]   So the first is this, who you hang out with really matters.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:45.900]   The second is this,
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.180]   you're not just receiving belief or disbelief,
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.980]   but you are giving belief or disbelief.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.040]   So as I was writing this message,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.660]   I was thinking about a specific moment
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.820]   that happens in our house every single day.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.340]   I'm married and I've got two girls.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.340]   They're three years old and eight months old.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.100]   And every single day in our house,
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.100]   I was gonna say we make dinner.
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.860]   I have never made dinner.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.780]   (laughing)
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.360]   It's just how it works.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.540]   My wife is amazing at this.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.060]   She makes dinner and then we sit down at the dinner table.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.540]   And then what happens every single time
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:24.180]   is I pray over our family and over the meal.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.860]   And when something happens at the same spot
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.700]   every single day, it could just get really,
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.540]   really repetitive.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:33.540]   And I've just found myself praying something like this.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.780]   God, thank you so much for this day.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.660]   God, thank you so much for this food you provide.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.380]   And I just pray you keep us safe.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.980]   It's in Jesus name I pray, amen.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.780]   And as I was looking at this text
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.780]   and I was looking at my life, I was like,
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.620]   oh, I look like the Israelites.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.620]   And oh, I don't want my little girls
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.020]   to look like the Israelites.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.580]   I was just thinking about what I've been passing on
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.080]   to my two little girls.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.760]   And I do not want their faith in God to be,
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.400]   God, would you just keep us safe?
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.640]   Would you just keep us right here in what we know?
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.000]   We're thankful for what we have
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   and would you just allow us to keep what we have
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.800]   and God, just keep us right here in what we know.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.920]   Would you keep us safe?
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.800]   I don't want my girls to believe that about God.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.240]   I don't want my girls to pray that to God.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.000]   But think about you.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.440]   Think about when you get around the people in your life.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.960]   When you get around the community group
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.000]   or the people that you drove here with.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.800]   Like when you're with your friends,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.280]   what do they hear you say about God
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.400]   and what do they hear you say when you talk to God?
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.760]   Like, let's just picture this.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.120]   Let's picture that you and your community group
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.480]   are sitting down for dinner and you're chosen to pray.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.320]   Do your prayers sound like,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.480]   God, thank you so much for today.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.120]   And God, thank you, man, for these people.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:53.960]   And thank you for this meal.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.320]   Would you bless this food to our bodies
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.200]   and keep us safe, Lord.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.800]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.880]   Or do you sit down around that table to pray
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.920]   with your community group and do you go,
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.720]   Father, I pray that you'd save every single young adult
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.360]   in Dallas, Texas through the people at this table.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.560]   Would sin be far from us?
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.920]   Father, may we never watch pornography,
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.520]   not just this week, but never again in our life.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.160]   May we never struggle with materialism ever again
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.000]   in our life.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   May our struggle with body image be gone.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.440]   And may my friend who has a strange relationship
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.760]   with his dad, may that be reunited tonight.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.120]   And God, may you kick Satan in the teeth
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.600]   through this community group.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.040]   And may you be on the move in Dallas through us.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.280]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.000]   I tell you what, that prayer sounds a whole lot different
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.840]   than this prayer.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.500]   My question is, which prayer are you praying and why?
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.780]   What do you believe about your God?
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.580]   Because I think your prayers say a lot
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.180]   about what you believe about God.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:03.040]   And one is a defensive prayer, Lord, just keep me safe.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.620]   One is an offensive prayer, Lord, let's go.
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.300]   Let's storm the gates of hell
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.380]   and let's see lost people be found.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.820]   Let's see dead people come to life.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.440]   And let's see sin not reign because the spirit does.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.180]   So my question is, what are you giving
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.260]   to the people in your life?
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.060]   Are you giving off faith or are you giving off fear?
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.800]   If it's fear, stop it.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.880]   By God's grace and God's power, stop it.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:41.180]   Let's pray bigger things because we got a bigger God.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.260]   So point number two, second thing that we can learn
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.460]   from this passage is this, disbelief will make you miss out
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.480]   on what God can do.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.580]   I wanna finish this passage by rereading verse 23
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.820]   and then we're gonna read verse 24.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.940]   God says this about the people who didn't trust him.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:02.100]   Verse 23, "Not one of them will ever see the land
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.600]   "I promised on oath to their ancestors.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.420]   "And no one who has treated me with contempt
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.360]   "will ever see it.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.680]   "But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.720]   "and follows me wholeheartedly,
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.440]   "I will bring him into the land he went to
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.220]   "and his descendants will inherit it.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.580]   "And you see, since he had a different spirit,
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.820]   "he had a different experience.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.580]   "And since he had a different belief,
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.540]   "he had a different life."
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.460]   And this is point number three,
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.860]   third thing we can learn from this text,
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.580]   a different spirit brings different results.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.020]   And poor child, I just want you to know,
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.860]   in fact, you probably already know this.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.460]   Most people will complain.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.400]   Most people will grumble.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.380]   Most people will disbelieve.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.500]   Most people will just wanna stay safe.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.460]   And most people will miss out on what God can do
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.120]   through their life.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.780]   I don't know about you, porch.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.360]   I don't wanna be most people.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.560]   I want to be filled with a different spirit.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.500]   I want to be filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.860]   because I want a different experience.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.260]   I want to see different things
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.740]   because a different spirit brings different results.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.860]   And since Caleb believed God would do it,
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.140]   he got to see God do it
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.900]   because a different spirit brings different results.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.900]   And I could give you many examples of this.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.200]   Here's one that feels the most relevant to me.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.940]   Some of you, in fact, maybe many of you
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.540]   know about something called Passion Conference.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.320]   It happens every single January.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.140]   And it was started by a pastor named
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.280]   Pastor Louis Giglio in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.420]   And I have a picture of, yeah, from this previous year,
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.980]   they met in the Atlanta Falcon Stadium,
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.300]   Mercedes Benz Stadium.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.780]   And this is specifically for college students.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.100]   And there's 65 college students
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.300]   from all around the country in this stadium,
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.460]   all to lift up the name of Jesus.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.100]   And he hasn't always met here.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.580]   Like it's grown year after year after year after year,
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.440]   and they haven't always met in the Atlanta Falcon Stadium.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.580]   And one year, they did rent out the arena
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.260]   and a few months before,
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.740]   apparently like ticket sales weren't necessarily
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.420]   where they needed to be.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.220]   Like it looked like they had bitten off a lot more
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.060]   than they could chew,
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.260]   and there was gonna be a bunch of holes in the stadium.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.580]   And it just, it was incredibly disheartening
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.340]   for the people who were putting on the conference.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.620]   And a couple of months before the conference,
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.780]   they got together as a team,
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.980]   and Pastor Louis walked into that meeting,
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.580]   and he said, "Guys, in two months,
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.520]   "whenever we walk in to the Benz,
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.900]   "and whenever I see every seat full,
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.240]   "I don't want my response to be,
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.200]   "I can't believe God did it.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.220]   "Instead, I want to be praying right now
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.940]   "and believing right now,
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.340]   "so that when I walk into that arena two months from now,
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.060]   "and I see every seat full, I go,
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:51.380]   "Of course God did it, because I believed he could,
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.900]   "because I've been praying that he would."
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.520]   And friends, I've just realized in my life,
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.860]   there are two different types of believers in Jesus.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.900]   God will provide in a miraculous way,
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.460]   and there is a group of Christians that will go,
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.020]   "I can't believe God did it."
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.560]   And there's another group of Christians that will go,
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.700]   "Of course God did it, because I believed that he would,
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.940]   "because I've been praying that he would.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.100]   "Of course God did it, because I knew he could."
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.300]   Now, porch, I also want to make it clear.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.140]   I'm not trying to communicate,
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.860]   "Hey, if you just believe God more,
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.860]   "you'll get all you possibly want."
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.820]   Like, "If you believe God more,
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.700]   "you'll be engaged by 10 p.m. tonight."
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.400]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.960]   Not what I'm saying.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:41.660]   But what I am saying is, as followers of Jesus,
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.380]   we have reason for great hope.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:49.500]   As followers of Jesus, we have reason for big belief.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.620]   And let me tell you why.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:55.220]   It's because as followers of Jesus,
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.660]   we have received a better report
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.100]   than the people of God did in Numbers chapter 13.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.980]   (congregation applauding)
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.820]   And let me tell you what it is.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.900]   Let me tell you what it is by showing you
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.620]   what's otherwise kind of an obscure verse.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.700]   Like, in the beginning of Numbers chapter 13,
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:18.020]   it just lists out all the people who were sent in by Moses
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.060]   into the promised land as spies.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.900]   And it lists out all the 12 tribes of Israel.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:27.420]   And in Numbers chapter 13, it tells us who Caleb was.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:31.420]   This is one of those verses that you typically skip over.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.460]   It seems like there's not a whole lot there.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.380]   There's a whole lot there.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.360]   Let me read it to you.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.660]   From the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:50.860]   From the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:57.460]   In Numbers chapter 13, the people of God feared death.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:02.300]   So Moses picked a man from the tribe of Judah.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.460]   He picked Caleb and he told Caleb,
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.060]   "Hey, go into the heart of enemy territory.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.220]   "And your job is to go into the heart of enemy territory
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.880]   "and to survey these people, to survey this enemy.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.420]   "And your job is to determine whether or not
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.900]   "we should fear this enemy.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.260]   "Your job as a spy is to determine whether or not
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.340]   "this enemy will put us to death."
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:31.900]   So this man from the tribe of Judah, Caleb,
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.820]   goes into the heart of enemy territory.
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.420]   He surveys the land, he surveys the people,
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.980]   he surveys the cities, and he comes back with a report
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.060]   for the people of God.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.420]   And he said, "We need not fear this enemy.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:49.020]   "We need not fear death for our God will win the victory."
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:56.880]   A little bit later in scripture, a lot later in scripture.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:02.940]   Once again, the people of God feared death from an enemy.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:08.260]   This time, God, not Moses,
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.100]   chose a man from the tribe of Judah.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.820]   And he sent him into the heart of enemy territory.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.500]   Revelation calls him the lion of the tribe of Judah.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.420]   You know him by the name of Jesus.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.100]   And he chose this man,
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.140]   and he sent him into the heart of enemy territory.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.860]   This time though, he wasn't sent in as a spy,
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.620]   but as a warrior.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.180]   And he did not go in to survey our enemy,
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.140]   he went in to slay our enemy.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.980]   And he died on the cross.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.180]   Three days later, rose again,
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.060]   and he came back with a report for the people of God.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:46.700]   And he said, "You need not fear death,
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.420]   "for death has been destroyed.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.300]   "You need not fear judgment,
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.020]   "for your sin has been forgiven."
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:57.060]   And remember that snake back in Genesis chapter three,
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.340]   I just stomped on his head.
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.260]   And you need not fear anything,
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.900]   for I am alive and with you and for you.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.300]   And he said, "Report, my question is,
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.180]   "what report are you gonna believe?
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.700]   "What report are you gonna trust?"
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:19.060]   You see, we as the people of God have an opportunity.
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.780]   In Numbers chapter 13 and 14,
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.900]   the people of God had an opportunity.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.100]   They failed the test.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.580]   May we not fail the test.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.820]   You see, there's gonna be a lot of people.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.860]   A lot of people are gonna say fear, panic, anxiety.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:37.740]   We're gonna lose.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.100]   There's gonna be people within the church that say that.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.060]   You don't need to listen to that report,
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.460]   'cause that report is not true,
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.380]   because we've heard from the man from the tribe of Judah.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.620]   We've heard from the lion of Judah,
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.540]   and he's given us a better report.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:56.460]   The question that you have to answer tonight is,
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:00.020]   what report are you gonna believe?
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.540]   And who are you gonna trust?
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:07.060]   Because who you trust changes how you see your life.
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.780]   And I don't know about you.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.020]   I just know that for me.
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:16.180]   I do not want to get to the end of my life
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.740]   and have it be said of me that I trust God for too little,
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.300]   that I ask God for too little.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.180]   I would much rather get to the end of my life
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.500]   and meet my Savior face to face
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.100]   and have Jesus look at me and go,
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:28.940]   "You know, Nate,
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.940]   "you kinda overshot some things down there."
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.380]   Like, "You thought I could do more than I actually could."
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.260]   I would much rather lean in that direction,
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:43.100]   because I would much rather believe for things
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.260]   and pray for things
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.540]   that make me look like a fool in front of you,
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.420]   than believe for things and pray for things
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.700]   that make me look like a fool in front of Him.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:56.060]   So what I want us to do right now, yeah,
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.900]   is I want us to spend time in prayer,
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.820]   and I want us to do two things.
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:06.100]   The first is, I just want us all to repent
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.140]   of the ways in which we have not believed God
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.060]   in the ways in which we should.
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.980]   All of us, myself included,
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.540]   have not believed God in the way in which we should.
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.580]   So let's just go to Him and repent of that.
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:23.420]   And the second thing I wanna do is,
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.340]   I just want us to ask God,
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.380]   "God, what's the one thing in my life
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.580]   that seems too big,
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.060]   that seems too hard,
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.380]   that seems too far gone?
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.780]   What's that one thing in my life
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.860]   that you want me to start praying for?"
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.420]   And I don't know what it is for you.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.620]   Maybe it's that your mom would be freed from alcoholism.
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:51.780]   Maybe it's that you'd begin
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.340]   to have a relationship with your dad.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.340]   Maybe it's that you'd be freed from a certain sin.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.740]   Maybe it's that God would provide financially.
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.900]   And honestly, I don't even wanna keep giving options
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.220]   because I would rather have the Holy Spirit
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.300]   bring it to mind than have me bring it to mind.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.580]   So right now, let's go before God.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.420]   Let's do those two things.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.100]   Let's repent and then let's ask Him.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:17.420]   God, you are a holy God.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.940]   You are a big God.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.340]   You are so much bigger and so much stronger
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.740]   than what we know you to be.
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.740]   (gentle music)
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.540]   And Father, I know that at least for me,
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:31.620]   at least for me,
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.860]   I come before you right now with a repentant heart
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.060]   and a repentant spirit.
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.300]   And I just wanna tell you,
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.300]   God, I'm so sorry for the ways
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.980]   in which I've looked like the 10 and not the two.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.660]   In the ways I've just wanted to be safe,
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.100]   in the ways I've just wanted to complain,
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.220]   in the ways I've just wanted to stay stagnant.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.900]   Father, I'm sorry for the ways in which I've missed it.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.740]   You know, God, we are a funny people as followers of Jesus.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.980]   We can say things like we believe Jesus conquered death,
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.820]   but we don't think He can do this smaller thing.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.380]   May that be far from us.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:14.780]   And now, God, I just come before you right now
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.500]   on behalf of all my friends here in this room.
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:22.060]   And I just pray that you bring something to mind
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.060]   by the power of your Holy Spirit,
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.860]   that your Holy Spirit would bring something to mind.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.500]   A unique thing in every single person's life right now.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.140]   Something that seems too hard, too difficult,
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.620]   too big, too impossible.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.740]   Something where it's like,
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.860]   unless God moves, it can't get done.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:51.060]   Father, maybe it's something that they prayed for years ago
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.780]   and stopped praying for years ago.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.500]   Maybe it's something that they've never even had
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.460]   the courage to pray, or maybe it's something
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.860]   that they've just thought for the first time right now.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:05.420]   God, I pray that every single one of those things
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.260]   would happen tonight.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.460]   We believe you can do it.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.220]   We pray that freedom would happen tonight,
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.660]   that reconciliation would happen tonight,
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.940]   that salvation would happen tonight,
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:21.260]   that provision would happen tonight.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.060]   Whatever it is, Father, we know that you can do it.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.420]   So God, we ask that you would do it now.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.500]   By the power of God, we ask that you would do it now.
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:35.820]   And God, if you don't do it tonight,
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:40.020]   may we still be found praying tomorrow,
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.900]   and the next day, and the next day, and the next day.
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.980]   And may we be found like beggars at your door,
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.660]   knocking on your door, asking for bread.
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.780]   Day after day after day, asking for you to do it.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.780]   And God, I also wanna declare
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:03.220]   that even if you never do it, you've already done enough.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:07.100]   Because you sent your one and only Son
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.940]   because you loved us so much,
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.220]   and he lived the life we should have lived.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.380]   He died the death we should have died,
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.140]   and three days later, he rose again
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:17.940]   so that we could have life and freedom for all of eternity.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.060]   So even if you don't do another thing,
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.940]   we know you've done the thing that we need.
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:30.300]   And Father, we're here tonight for one reason.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:34.700]   We wanna worship you tonight for one reason.
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:38.140]   We have hope tonight for one reason, and one reason only,
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.180]   and it's because of the fact that Jesus is alive,
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.820]   and with us, and for us.
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.700]   We wanna worship him with all we've got now.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.860]   It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
