[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (rock music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:24.360]   - Well good evening Dallas and Fort Worth and Houston
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.060]   and lots of other friends that are joining us
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.720]   around the country, whether you're dialed in
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.160]   on a computer or your phone, Portchat, online
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.000]   or wherever you might be.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.320]   So glad that we're here together as we continue
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.800]   the series One Nation Under God.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.260]   I'll start with a story.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.520]   Nine months ago I got engaged to my best friend,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.520]   three months ago married, and I find a reason
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.920]   to talk about that every time I'm here.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.080]   And this time's no different.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.560]   And so the day after we got engaged,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.100]   we drove back from West Texas.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.680]   There's a beautiful hole in the ground out there
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.800]   called Palo Duro Canyon, great engagement spot.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.920]   And so we went there and as we drove back,
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.920]   the day after we had a little engagement party.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.600]   Now I know what happens at engagement parties.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.160]   For some reason, everyone is very friendly,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.060]   most of the time, and then there's this very cruel moment
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.800]   where people demand an impromptu speech.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.540]   And friends just turn on one another.
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.920]   It's nasty if you've seen this.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.640]   And they start yelling speech and they demand it.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.160]   And so I thought this is gonna happen, maybe.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.320]   And so I wanna be ready.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.680]   And so I started to think, what am I going to say?
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.260]   And I know it takes away from the impromptu,
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.640]   but I started thinking I wanted to be ready
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.840]   to say something that was meaningful.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.040]   I figured I would say thank you,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.640]   I figured I would say something hopefully honoring
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.400]   to the woman who is agreeing to, you know,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.520]   and trust her life to me.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.880]   And so I crafted this little speech.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.680]   And I knew, I thought, what do I wanna say?
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.320]   And I came down to one little sentence
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.840]   that I knew I wanted to include, just one,
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.120]   that I knew I wanted to be a part of it.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.260]   And so sure enough, we walk in and we didn't look for it,
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.760]   we didn't ask for it, but at some point, as they do,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.880]   they start yelling for story
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.920]   and they start yelling for speech.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.480]   And so she tells the story of how we got engaged.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.560]   And then it was my turn to speak.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.320]   And I said the one sentence that I had planned.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.120]   I of course said, thank you guys for being here.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.720]   Thank you for being a part of our relationship.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.900]   We were packed into this little house
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.440]   where I was living at the time.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.320]   And I said, thank you guys for being a part
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.160]   of our relationship.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.980]   You supported us.
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.600]   You were 911 when we were in trouble
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.240]   and you were there when we needed you
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.040]   and you supported us and kept us accountable and all this.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.160]   And so we got through that part.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.600]   And then I got to the part where I wanted
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.960]   to say the sentence that I was gonna say.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.560]   And I said it well, but it was just a little bit
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.400]   of a strange sentence.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.000]   And so what I said was, I was trying to compliment,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.880]   Gabby, I think I did successfully, by the way,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.720]   you be the judge.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.440]   And I said, I choose you, selected these words
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.680]   on purpose, believe it or not.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.780]   I choose you to be the leader of my life.
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.640]   And they said, aw, but I think they were thinking,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.400]   did he just say leader, lover?
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.360]   Isn't that a weird thing to say?
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.400]   I mean, what did he mean, leader of my life?
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.520]   Isn't that a weird thing to say?
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.040]   I mean, why wouldn't you say, you are so beautiful?
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.740]   Or why wouldn't you say, even thank you?
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.560]   Or why wouldn't you say something like,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.120]   I choose you to be my best friend, my wife.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.880]   I mean, even spouse would have been less awkward than leader.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.960]   I mean, why would you say leader?
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.180]   It's like, calm down, this is not in the army now, okay?
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.360]   Why would you say, and plus, isn't leader,
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.040]   isn't that supposed to be like the guy thing in the Bible?
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.840]   Not sure about that, but why would you say leader?
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.440]   And here's the reason why I did.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.440]   Because leading is influencing.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.200]   Leading to lead someone is to influence them.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.800]   And who would have more influence over me?
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.480]   And who will have more influence over you
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.200]   than someone who is around you most of the time?
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.400]   More than any other human, more than any other person.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.520]   Who would have proximity to me,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.920]   just by sheer closeness would have more influence over me
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.960]   over than any other person.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.800]   And so that dawned on me, and at some point I realized,
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.640]   you know what I'm doing while I was dating her?
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.560]   You know what I'm doing?
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.040]   I am doing lots of things.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.640]   One of them is choosing a leader.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.160]   Not an office of leader, like I do what she says,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.960]   the scripture says, serve one another through love.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.240]   Not like the office of commander,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.360]   but what I mean is influencer.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.720]   Unavoidably, when you bring someone in close to you
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.080]   like that, they are just going to influence you.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.480]   Leading is influencing.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.920]   And when you get close to someone,
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.280]   they start to influence you,
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.240]   and you choose leaders more than you think.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.640]   I'm gonna talk tonight about how to choose a leader.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.680]   How to choose a leader, because I am convinced,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.360]   and I hope you will be just shortly,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.560]   that you choose more leaders than you think you do.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.040]   You choose leaders more often than you think you do,
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.200]   and you're probably more influenceable
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.240]   than you think you are.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.920]   And so tonight is called how to choose a leader.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.200]   Granted, not how to choose a president,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.020]   although we're gonna discuss that later in the evening.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.080]   I am well aware of what's gonna happen in seven days.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.160]   But what I wanna talk about tonight
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.840]   is how to choose a leader of any kind.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.680]   And you choose more leaders than you think you do.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.040]   Listen to this.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.760]   Have you ever gotten out of a relationship
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.440]   and said these words?
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.760]   I just didn't like who I was when I was with him.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.480]   Or I just didn't like who I was when I was with her.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.040]   You ever heard a friend say that?
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.520]   It's not because they're an especially weak person,
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.960]   it's a means that they're a wise person.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.640]   They have come to realize that the person
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.280]   that they were close to started to change them
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.600]   to be like them.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.440]   The people that you get close to start to lead you.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.760]   That means, if that's true,
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.040]   anytime you get into a relationship, you choose a leader.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.200]   Not just a person to go on dates with,
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.840]   not just a person to share conversations with.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.680]   You are choosing a leader,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.600]   someone who is going to turn you into themself.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.360]   You know that group of friends, here's another example.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.440]   You ever had that group of friends
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.360]   where it's like every time I hang out with you guys,
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.000]   something bad is going to happen.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.160]   I never plan on it, I don't want it to happen.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.840]   I'm specifically planning against it
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.440]   and then I answer your phone call
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.400]   and then I got a hangover.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.360]   I don't know how it goes that way.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.160]   But that's just how it works.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.720]   And so has it dawned on you?
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.560]   Think about this.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.680]   Maybe you aren't choosing friends on Thursday night.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.040]   You might be choosing leaders.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.760]   You choose leaders more than you think you do.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.080]   Every time, think about this.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.160]   Every time you say yes to a job,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.360]   are you not saying yes to another person's influence
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.600]   and direction?
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.760]   Are you not saying yes, for better or for worse,
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.760]   for someone to shape your life for 40 hours per week?
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.400]   You are saying yes to a leader.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.360]   You are opening yourself to influence.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.760]   Every time you come to church,
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.640]   when you choose a church,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.600]   when you choose to come to the porch on Tuesday night,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.160]   or when you choose to go to another gathering
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.240]   that claims the name of Jesus,
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.960]   or when you turn even on a podcast of your choosing,
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.480]   every time you do that,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.400]   you are opening yourself to influence.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.640]   And I believe that if you open yourself to influence,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.600]   you're opening yourself to leadership.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.720]   You're opening yourself to being led.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.560]   When I was a kid, my parents were divorced.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.840]   And some of the kids,
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.440]   three of the brothers and sisters had live conversations
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.640]   about whether we wanna live with mom
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.040]   or whether we wanted to live with dad.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.000]   That's just another way of saying
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.220]   we want to choose our leader.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.880]   You choose leaders all the time.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.400]   When you chose your university,
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.640]   you said, "I would like for you to educate me."
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.320]   And to be educated by someone
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.520]   is to be influenced by them.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.320]   And to be influenced by them is to be led by them.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.560]   And so you choose leaders much more often
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.400]   than you think you do.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.000]   And so what I wanna do is, especially in seven days,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.120]   and so what I wanna do tonight
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.880]   is I wanna give you one question
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.120]   that you can take with you
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.600]   anytime you need to interview a leader,
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.040]   anytime you want to examine a leader,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.880]   anytime you want to know
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.040]   whether a leader is worth following.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.760]   I want you to have one question.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.560]   From the scriptures, not my question.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.040]   It's not the Democratic Party's question.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.560]   It's not the Republican Party's question.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.560]   It's nobody's question except the scriptures.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.560]   And so what I want you to do
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.900]   is see a very scriptural question
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.920]   that you can take with you
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.160]   anytime you need to know if someone is worth following.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.000]   That's my goal that you can take with you tonight.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Not three points tonight,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.100]   just one question that I hope you'll remember
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.940]   for a long time.
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.220]   And anytime it is time to choose a leader,
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.880]   much more often than once every four years, I hope.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.200]   Anytime you choose a church,
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.800]   spouse, someone to go on a date with,
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.160]   church, I should say again,
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.560]   education, you got any of it.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.520]   Microphone trouble?
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.920]   Microphone trouble, friends?
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:01.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.160]   Now we got microphone trouble.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.880]   How we doing, is that better?
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.960]   Okay, great, sorry about that.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.360]   Let's start over, just kidding.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.160]   Somebody needs to lead this guy.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.000]   All right.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.080]   So what we're gonna do is we're gonna look
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   at a human leader in the scripture,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.560]   a human leader in the Bible.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.760]   Can we pause one more time?
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.040]   I feel like I got like just a press conference in my face.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.680]   And so Billy, can I take this off?
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:30.600]   Okay, that's good, I'll leave it back.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.040]   Just talk amongst yourselves.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.200]   I'm kidding, we'll call that good enough.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.320]   Okay, we're gonna look in the scripture
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   at a human leader from whom you can gather an example,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.480]   an example of what not to do, okay?
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.640]   His name, well, I won't tell you his name yet.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.280]   He was a governor at the time of Jesus.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.320]   When Jesus was around,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.880]   when Jesus was practicing his earthly ministry,
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.160]   when Jesus was practicing his life
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.400]   and his leadership on earth,
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.320]   it would be AD 30 to AD 33.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.040]   And when he was practicing his ministry,
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.720]   there was a man who was a governor over that area.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   And that man goes by a name
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.320]   that has been remembered to history
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   only because of his association with Jesus.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.840]   And that man's name is Pontius Pilate.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.440]   And Pontius Pilate was a human leader
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.240]   who did not do, who would fail the test of the question
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.480]   that I'm gonna ask you to remember and ask,
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.320]   not only in seven days,
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.400]   but anytime you choose to choose a leader.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.240]   And so Pontius Pilate is in the latter chapters
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.960]   of the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.320]   which are like the biographies of Jesus,
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.240]   And so you can go to John chapter 18,
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.520]   that's where we're gonna jump in this evening.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.360]   And we're gonna listen in
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.560]   on a set of fascinating conversations,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.680]   fascinating conversations between Pilate and Jesus,
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.560]   a famously bad leader
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.120]   and the most famous person who've ever lived.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.320]   Whispered conversations between these two people
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.480]   that are known to history
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.740]   while the crowd outside is yelling for Jesus to die.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.240]   So let's go to John chapter 18, verse 33.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   It says, "So Pilate entered his headquarters again."
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.480]   And so think like Capitol of Texas building, okay?
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.760]   So he's the man, so he's got the palace.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.360]   "Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.040]   "and said to him, 'Are you the King of the Jews?'"
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.240]   Now here's something you'd wanna know.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   That was the big question
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.120]   that was bothering the Jewish leaders around Jesus.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.160]   And so the big claim of Jesus was that I am the Messiah,
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.800]   I am the King, I am the one that the Old Testament
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   that we would call the Old Testament scriptures
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.840]   said was coming.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.880]   I'm here and I am your King
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.680]   and the Jewish leaders wrongly rejected him.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.720]   And so the question, are you the King of the Jews?
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.520]   Was the question at hand.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.680]   And Pilate asked Jesus the question
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.920]   that everybody was asking,
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.240]   are you not claiming to be the King of the Jews?
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.080]   And Jesus answered, this is a very Jesus-like thing to do,
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.160]   answers a question with a question.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.720]   It says, "Do you say this of your own accord?"
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.960]   Which means are you interested personally?
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.280]   "Or did others say it to you about me?"
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   Meaning, are you looking for the truth?
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.520]   Like, is this a sincere investigation?
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.520]   Do you really wanna know if I'm the King of the Jews?
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.640]   Or are you just here
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.160]   because that's what the crowd told you to ask?
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.200]   And Pilate answered,
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.560]   he gives his answer away pretty clearly.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.800]   Am I a Jew?
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.840]   In other words, I'm not even one of your people.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.400]   What is this dispute to me?
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.400]   Your own nation and the chief priests
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.200]   have delivered you over to me.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.360]   What have you done?
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.640]   Pilate is not on a sincere search.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.760]   Pilate is not looking for the truth.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.480]   Pilate wants this problem to go away.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.120]   He wants this problem to disappear.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.640]   He wants to shoo it under the rug.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.640]   He wants this dissension to go away
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.760]   so that way Caesar and the government,
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.560]   the Roman government that was over him
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.840]   would not look poorly on him.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.960]   And so he says, what have you done?
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.160]   I'm not Jewish, I don't care.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.680]   And Jesus answered, Jesus, if you've ever wondered
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.880]   if Jesus takes the time to love people who don't know him,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.720]   love leaders who don't know him,
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.200]   love people who are giving sarcasm right to his face,
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.040]   this is your answer.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.440]   Jesus, with his own life on the line,
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.840]   because people outside are yelling for Jesus to die,
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.360]   takes time to love Pilate
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.720]   and reveal himself to him in this conversation.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.960]   Verse 36, Jesus answered, my kingdom is not of this world.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.560]   If it was, my servants would be fighting out here.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.160]   That's like what people do when there's an earthly kingdom.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.560]   The military defends the leader, that's just how it works.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.800]   But my kingdom's not of this world.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.000]   If it was, my servants would have been fighting
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.080]   so that I wouldn't be delivered over to you.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.920]   But my kingdom is not from this world.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.680]   And Pilate continues just to try to get to the bottom
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.120]   of the matter as a pragmatist.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.400]   And he says, so you are a king.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.080]   Just the harassed governor
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.240]   who wants to get this thing settled and over with.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.760]   And Jesus said, you said it, you say that I am a king.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.840]   For this purpose, I was born.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.440]   And for this purpose, I have come into the world
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.320]   to bear witness to the truth.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.400]   Now there's something that Pilate's not interested in.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.320]   Pilate is interested in doing what the crowd says.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.040]   Pilate is interested in moving on to what's next.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.800]   And Jesus said, if you want, listen, Pilate,
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   I know this is a tough one
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.120]   because there are people outside
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.880]   that are yelling for me to die right now.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.720]   And they're threatening you if you don't do it.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.840]   And so granted, you're in a little bit of a tough spot.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.720]   But if you wanna be on the side of the truth,
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.000]   if you want reality,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.680]   if you're here to actually give a statement
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.400]   and rather a discovery of what is real in this situation,
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.160]   what's authentic and true and virtuous and right
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.480]   and all of the things that a leader should look for,
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.240]   if you want to know, I am your ticket.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.240]   Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.440]   And then Pilate said to him,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.520]   the sarcastic three words
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.080]   that he's probably best known for.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.920]   What is truth?
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.000]   What is truth?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.520]   That's not a question that he wants answered.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.480]   He doesn't care.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   What he's saying is I don't care what's real.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.760]   I care what works.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.280]   And I want this to go away
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.880]   because the people want you to go away.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.040]   So what is truth?
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.840]   It's dangerous.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.760]   So what Pilate does is he tries a happy medium.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.000]   I won't walk all the way through the text.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.360]   'Cause I want to keep this going tonight.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.600]   But Pilate tries a happy medium.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.960]   And so what he does is he decides
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   I'm gonna have Jesus beaten.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.400]   And then maybe that will be good enough.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.640]   And so what he does is he has Jesus handed over
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.480]   to be beaten.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.000]   And so this Jesus who claimed to be the King
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.680]   who indeed was, was hit and struck.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.280]   The son of God in human form,
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.560]   struck and beaten and bloody.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.040]   They mocked him, mocked, made fun of
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.040]   by putting a purple robe on him, the color of royalty.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.680]   And by putting a crown on his head,
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.600]   but a crown not of respect,
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.160]   but a crown of pain and mockery.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.920]   Crown of thorns to dig into his skull.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.040]   And he was handed over to be beaten.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.200]   And so Pilate having done that brings Jesus back out.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.040]   And so imagine standing on the Capitol steps
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.040]   of some major city or maybe even the United States.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.120]   Imagine the governor standing beside Jesus
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.440]   and saying, look at him now, behold the man.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.560]   Your Bible says, behold the man.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.280]   He's beaten, he's hurting.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.800]   In other words, is this good enough for you guys?
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.560]   But the crowd just kept yelling, crucify him, crucify him.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.360]   Which is to say, give him the worst form of execution
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.960]   that this world has ever known.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.880]   And it says that Pilate was even more afraid.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.920]   And he tries to get out of it one last time
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.480]   and rushes Jesus back into the headquarters
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.680]   for one last conversation.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.480]   And here is where he reveals his most crucial mistake.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.480]   He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus,
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.960]   who now Jesus probably is bloody and dizzy and hurting
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.240]   and looking back at Pilate through black eyes.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.920]   Where are you from?
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.360]   But Jesus would give him no answer.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.160]   And then Pilate finally boils over and says,
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.880]   you won't even speak to me?
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.040]   Do you not know, listen to this.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you?
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.120]   Do you not know that I have authority to release you
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.960]   and authority to crucify you?
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.360]   So slow down and see the irony of this.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.560]   We've got Jesus here, who is the son of God.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.680]   He knows all about authority.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.400]   In fact, he specifically said just a few chapters earlier,
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.760]   no one takes my life from me, I lay it down
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   and I have authority to pick it back up again.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.640]   And so you've got Jesus in the flesh,
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.160]   in humility submitting himself to the leadership of God
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.920]   and the leadership of God through this painful event,
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.960]   but the one who has all of the authority and knows it.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.600]   And then you've got a man
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.880]   who would not even be known to history
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.160]   if it weren't for his association
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.040]   with the beaten and bloody man.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.640]   We wouldn't even know who he is.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.800]   And he looks at Jesus, the one who was strong enough,
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.160]   not to flex his authority, but to lay it down.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.600]   And he says, he has the audacity to say,
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.280]   I have authority over you.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.440]   And Jesus takes the time to correct him.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.680]   And he says, you would have no authority over me at all,
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.320]   unless it had been given you from above.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.560]   Pilate looks right at Jesus and says,
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.060]   hey, I know you're going silent,
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.200]   but don't you know I'm in charge?
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.280]   And Jesus says, you are not in charge.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.920]   That's what you forgot.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.640]   You are not in control.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.320]   You are not in control of this situation nor any other.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.400]   You have earthly authority,
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.040]   but earthly authority has this funny characteristic.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.640]   It's always borrowed from heaven, 100% of the time.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.320]   And so Pilate has the nerve to look at Jesus and say,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.160]   I'm in charge.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.980]   And Jesus says, no, you're not.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.680]   The only charge you have is been granted to you
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.000]   from above where I'm from.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.800]   Pilate has no idea the insanity that he's doing.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.520]   That's like borrowing money from the bank
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.600]   and then looking at the teller and saying,
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.360]   I have money over you.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.120]   Do you?
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.160]   Really?
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.440]   That's what Pilate is doing.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.980]   He has, and he doesn't even know it.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.900]   See, Jesus knew the scripture that says,
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.900]   the heart of a ruler, the inner working of a ruler
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.900]   is like water in the hand of God.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.900]   You know, water is like the most multiple thing we have.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.240]   You put water in a cup, it's shaped like a cup.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.560]   You put water in a bucket, it's shaped like a bucket.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.120]   You put water on the ground, it has no shape
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.520]   because nothing is holding it up.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.800]   And the scripture says, the heart of presidents
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.520]   and rulers and kings is like that in the hand of God.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.560]   He turns them whichever way he wills.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.400]   Jesus knows that.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.440]   Jesus also knows Psalm 2, which was written
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.160]   a thousand years before his birth, that says,
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.160]   God laughs while the nations rage and plot in vain.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.200]   'Cause that's the only way nations can plot against God.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.040]   Jesus knows that.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.840]   And he knew the scripture that would be written
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   shortly thereafter this time that says,
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.640]   no authority is here except from God.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.360]   There is no authority except from God.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.180]   Jesus knew that and Pilate didn't.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.640]   When I was a kid, I had a moment like this happen to me.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.880]   Every year I had a tradition with my teachers.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.720]   They didn't know it because I had
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.960]   a different teacher each year.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.720]   Thankfully, progress is good.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.900]   And so I had a different teacher each year,
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.080]   but I had a tradition with all of them
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.520]   that was just mine to know.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.160]   And that was around the fourth or fifth week of school.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.520]   They would take me out in the hall
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.880]   and attempt to get me to quiet down.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.280]   And so I was a noisy kid.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.640]   I don't know about you.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.600]   I know there's some quiet, studious ones in here.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.600]   You were like front row Joe and took a lot of notes.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   I was like back corner clown.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.000]   That's kind of where I was living.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.680]   And I don't know why, I just enjoyed a good ruckus.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.260]   And so every year I just decided that it was my opportunity
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.720]   to run a little rebellion as long as
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.820]   the teacher would allow it.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.280]   And so some teachers were third week,
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.300]   some teachers were sixth week.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.180]   I think I had even one, poor dear soul,
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.880]   make it all the way until November.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.480]   But I always ended up in the hallway
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.720]   getting a talk from my teacher.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.000]   And so some of them were like, would bargain.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.240]   So I learned all the tactics.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.960]   Some of them would bargain and some of them would convince
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.360]   and some of them would threaten.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.720]   And some of them even spanked.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.000]   So I grew up in small town Texas.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.920]   I got spanked by a teacher.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.520]   Oh yeah, I made it, it's okay.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.520]   And one teacher did it in a way that I will never forget.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.760]   She said, I mean in a way that any fourth grader
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.800]   can understand, she said, "Garrett Rayburn."
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.040]   That's what my mama calls me.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.760]   "Garrett Rayburn, you are a leader."
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.460]   Which I liked because that's playing to my ego.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:42.140]   She said, "You are a leader, but you are not the leader."
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.840]   In other words, everything clicked in my mind.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.740]   What she meant was, you do have little person,
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.040]   a little bit of influence on these other little people
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.760]   around you, but here's the deal.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.580]   You are all very little and you can either lead
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.700]   those people around you as part of my good purposes
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.320]   and program for this little planet,
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.240]   or you can run a rebellion and it's gonna go bad
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.640]   for all of you, but here's the deal.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.480]   Make no mistake about it.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.200]   You might have a little bit of authority given to you,
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.800]   but you are on a leash, buddy.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.160]   I am the leader.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.360]   And Jesus has this conversation of taking Pilate
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.240]   into the hallway and explaining in no uncertain terms,
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.640]   you have a leader.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.920]   You are not on your own authority.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.200]   You do not operate.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.940]   No matter what you may say, it doesn't matter
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.260]   what Roman God you've been worshiping
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.720]   or what Greek God you've been worshiping.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.280]   Long before you ever had a worldview,
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.320]   there was a God who knew you and made you
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.240]   and chose to install you the end.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.180]   You borrowed your authority from him.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:43.080]   And Jesus has that moment with Pilate.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.600]   And if I had to tell you one thing Pilate was following,
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.220]   I would say more than anything, it's debated among scholars,
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.080]   I would say, of which I'm not one,
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.120]   but I would say if Pilate was following anything,
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.880]   it was the crowd and himself.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.360]   Whatever the crowd got loud and wanted.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.920]   That's all of a sudden what Pilate wanted.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.080]   Whatever he decided was expedient for him.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.040]   Whatever he decided would help his sovereign,
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   what a joke, purposes most.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.880]   That's what he chose to do.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.640]   Every leader, hang on to this,
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.400]   every leader who has ever lived is following something.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.840]   Pilate was no different.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.360]   Pilate had a leader, whether he believed it or not,
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.320]   and he was following something, whether he knew it or not.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.560]   And he was following himself,
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.720]   he was following convenience,
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   and he was following the demands of the crowd.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.120]   That's what Pilate was following.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.960]   And so if you want to know,
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.440]   if you want to know how to know
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.380]   where a leader is going to take you,
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.620]   I have one question I would love for you to hang on to.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.680]   You can learn it straight from the negative example
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.200]   of Pontius Pilate a long time ago.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.560]   You can ask this question.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.420]   To find out whether someone is worth following.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:00.060]   Who is the leader of this leader?
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.940]   Who is the leader of this leader?
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.980]   Where are they going?
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.940]   Who or what is influencing the person
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.000]   who is doing all the influencing?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.620]   Is it a creed?
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.700]   Is it a motto?
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.780]   Is it a belief system, some body of truth, a religion?
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.600]   Is it Jesus?
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.740]   Is it themselves, a desire for power?
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.780]   What is driving them?
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.400]   Because every human leader has one thing in common.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.180]   They are following something,
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.380]   whether they know it or not,
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.780]   and their authority is borrowed,
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.300]   whether they know it or not.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.420]   And so the question for you is,
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.140]   anytime you choose anyone,
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.480]   anytime you even evaluate leadership
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.100]   from a parent to a president,
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.620]   you need to ask the question,
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:43.700]   who is leading the person who is doing the leading?
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.020]   Who is the leader of this leader?
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.520]   If you think back on some of the moments of your life
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.880]   that you regret most,
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.460]   you would probably find
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.940]   that something was doing the leading of you
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.920]   that should not have been doing the leading.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.100]   When you think back on your least favorite family memories,
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.100]   which can be painful for some of you, for some of us,
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.980]   you're probably likely to find
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.060]   that one of the reasons those memories are so tough
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.340]   is because something that was not good
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.240]   was in charge of the person in charge.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.620]   And when you think about a dating relationship gone wrong,
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.040]   it gets kind of dark and manipulative,
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.920]   and all of a sudden it feels like a game,
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.140]   something is influencing the person
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.160]   who is influencing you that is not good.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.760]   And if you wanna evaluate
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.160]   whether someone's influence is okay
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.600]   for you to open yourself to,
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.820]   you need to ask this very simple question.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.560]   It will not make you a good leader.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.820]   It will help you spot and find good leaders.
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.480]   Who is the leader of this leader?
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.400]   And if you think of the best moments
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.880]   in the history of the United States,
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.560]   where names like Lincoln, Washington, King,
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.900]   and you think about what was leading them,
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.800]   they would have told you that they were divinely led
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.760]   and their lives actually matched.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.740]   They weren't perfect.
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.780]   I don't like to deify the heroes of the past,
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.540]   but they followed the deity who founded this country.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.440]   They were divinely led.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.160]   Everyone is following something, everyone.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.300]   And you can find out who is the leader of this leader
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.180]   as best you can.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.860]   So let's spend a few minutes tonight
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.740]   talking about what's gonna happen in the next seven days.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.140]   Because I understand that as I say,
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.700]   who is the leader of this leader?
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.220]   We've got some issues already, all right?
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.500]   And so I'm gonna make a clear turn away from John 18,
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.300]   and I'm gonna talk a little bit about
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.620]   how we can take this issue of the presidential election
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:42.700]   in a way that is biblical, in a way that's well-informed,
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.300]   in a way that gets heads nodding instead of dividing,
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.300]   and in a way that is honoring to the king
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.700]   who knew exactly who his leader was.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.060]   And so one thing I won't do is I won't tell you how to vote.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.560]   I won't tell you how to do that.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.060]   But what I will do is try to say something
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.440]   that's constructive and helpful to give you a process.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.700]   I don't think I can give you answers.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.700]   I think I can give you, biblically, a process
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.980]   in the time that we have left tonight.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.420]   And so you can try this on.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.460]   If this doesn't work for you, then let's talk about it.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.380]   If this does work for you, then go and do it.
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.340]   But I can't give you an answer, I can't force it to you,
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.740]   and I can't make you do what I think
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.980]   scripture would move us toward.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.900]   But I promise you this, I will pull no punch
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.420]   for the next 10 minutes, and we can talk about it afterward.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.340]   And I'm gonna be very honest with you.
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.980]   And I wanna try to give you a process and not an answer.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.340]   So some of you during this message
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.300]   have probably been thinking this one little thought,
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.420]   and it's been in the back of my mind too,
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.500]   and so I'm gonna be really honest with you.
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.400]   One of the things I've been thinking is, hmm,
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.820]   and this is gonna be agreeing for many of you,
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.220]   and your head's gonna nod, and you're gonna wanna clap,
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.660]   and some of you are gonna be highly offended.
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.020]   And so here we go.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.900]   The thought that I've been thinking this whole time is,
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.380]   wouldn't it be nice if we had
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.780]   a well-led leader in the election?
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.220]   Wouldn't it be nice?
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.100]   Okay, that was half and half, so half offended people.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.900]   All right, so wouldn't it be nice,
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.260]   I'm not gonna turn this into the State of the Union,
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.660]   I promise, although that was encouraging.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:09.340]   So I, if you are looking around
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.980]   at the leading two candidates
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.820]   for the Republican Party and the Democratic Party,
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.220]   you might conclude there is nobody who is led by God
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.140]   in a way that it clearly comes out of them when they speak.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.020]   There is no one that is led by God
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.320]   that clearly comes out of them
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.700]   in the way that they form policy.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.260]   There is no one that is well-led
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.200]   and knows that the authority that has been given to them
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.220]   has been given to them, and has been borrowed.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.540]   And so I wanna agree with you.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.180]   This is the easiest election of my lifetime
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.200]   to be bipartisan.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.740]   I'm not in favor.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.740]   I believe that both participants of each leading party
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.140]   are biblically disqualified.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.980]   Both participants are biblically disqualified.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.980]   Listen here, one for their person
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.740]   and one for their policy.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.500]   One for their biblical personhood
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.340]   and personal qualities that do not match
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.700]   what a leader says in the scripture should be,
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.260]   and the other for policies which clearly,
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.540]   clearly undermine what God says is valuable.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.380]   And so if you're thinking,
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.220]   "Hmm, who's the leader of this leader?
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.220]   "See you in 2020.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.540]   "Can we get Obama on month to month
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.140]   "until we get some other candidates in here?"
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.540]   If you've been thinking that,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.060]   if you've been thinking that,
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.220]   you clearly have a few friends, and I'm one of 'em.
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.660]   And so that's where I'm hanging out.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.260]   And so here's the deal.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.900]   I can't, I promise I'm not trying to make you laugh.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.740]   And I, but the scripture says,
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.500]   "Refuse to call evil good."
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.220]   And friends, these people are not good.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.780]   Okay, that's where we're at.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.020]   (audience applauding)
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:54.100]   But there is still a political process
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.740]   that is unique to the world
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.580]   that you have a unique opportunity to participate in,
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.140]   and it's precious.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.420]   And so what in the world do we do?
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.780]   I wanna give you three steps.
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.380]   They've been counseled on from among our team,
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.220]   built together from among our staff.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.220]   These are steps.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.620]   These are not who to vote for.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.980]   These are ways that you can think
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.820]   and steps that you can take.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.100]   All right, number one.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.820]   Bring in your faith.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.140]   Bring in your faith.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.020]   What do I mean?
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.900]   I mean, if you claim to have a relationship
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.180]   with Jesus Christ of any kind,
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.580]   if you claim to be a follower of him,
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.740]   if you claim, "Hey, I like the person who is leading Jesus.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.540]   "He said, 'I only do what the Father tells me.'"
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.860]   That seems like a good person to follow
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.940]   'cause he's being well-led.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.340]   "I'll follow him."
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.220]   If you claim to be a follower of Jesus,
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.820]   you don't have an option other than to bring in
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:55.380]   your Christian faith informed by the Christian scriptures.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.660]   That is the only option for you.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.740]   Here's how I know that.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.980]   Romans 14, 23 says, listen to this,
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.620]   "Anything that does not come from faith is sin."
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.820]   So that's clear.
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.140]   Anything, any vote is included in anything.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.460]   And so it could easily be reread.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.620]   I don't wanna toy with the Bible.
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.620]   It says anything, but votes are considered a thing.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.220]   And so you could, with good conscience and integrity,
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.860]   say any vote, from a Christian at least,
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.580]   any vote that does not come from a Christian perspective,
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.460]   if that person is a believer in Jesus,
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.060]   they claim to be following Jesus,
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.940]   that vote is sin if their faith is not brought into it.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.260]   Some versions may say anything that does not proceed
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.820]   from faith is sin.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.900]   Anything that does not come from faith is sin.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.260]   And so you better make sure something healthy
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.860]   is leading you.
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.460]   You better make sure that your life is moving in a way
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.500]   that follows the shepherd.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.980]   He said, "I'm the good shepherd."
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.020]   Jesus did, "I'm the good shepherd.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.220]   "The sheep hear my voice."
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.860]   It is a really good week to hear the voice of Jesus.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.340]   And so first, bring in your faith.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.260]   Bring in the body of truth that is the Christian scriptures
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.700]   and be guided by prayer, by the counsel of community,
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.340]   and by your Christian conscience
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.220]   as informed by the scripture.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.180]   So that's step one, bring in your faith.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.980]   Step two, bring in the facts.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.500]   Bring in the facts, meaning make sure you have some semblance
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.180]   of an idea of what you're doing
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.380]   before you talk about this, please.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.780]   One of your least favorite things, I already know this,
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.820]   one of your least favorite things
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.580]   about the political season is people talk
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.580]   and they know not what they say, all right?
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.740]   They are just sounding off and they are talking
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.300]   and it's like, it would be great if you had a clue.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.940]   That would be amazing for all of us.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.260]   And so what you will find in political season
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.060]   that we do not like is that when people answer
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.540]   before they hear.
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.740]   So if that bothers you, I have good news for you.
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.940]   It bothers the Bible.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.140]   Proverbs 18, 13.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.940]   If one, I'm so serious.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.460]   If one gives an answer before he hears,
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.180]   it's his folly and shame.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.540]   So if you're in the political arena sounding off
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.740]   before you know what you're talking about,
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.140]   the Bible is making fun of you.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.500]   It is his folly and shame.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.820]   We don't want folly and shame.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.860]   And listen, if we go, if the United States of America
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.100]   goes to the polls and votes on these people
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.900]   without knowing what they speak on or what they vote on,
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.740]   it will be our folly and shame for a long time.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.380]   Bring in your faith and bring in the facts,
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.820]   not the opinions, not even the ones I give you.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.900]   You test everything I say with the scripture.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.300]   You bring in the faith and then you bring in the facts.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.600]   And then lastly, the hard one.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.500]   Make your choice.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.280]   Make your choice.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.380]   Now here's what I'd like to do in this moment.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.220]   Make your choice.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.380]   I mean, how do you really make your choice, right?
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.220]   What do you do?
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.620]   And so what I wanna do for you is as an observer of culture
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.420]   and as a researcher, what I wanna do
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.740]   is I wanna observe two trends for you.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.220]   I wanna observe and tell you,
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.900]   if you haven't researched yet, you're like,
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.020]   oh man, I didn't even know.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.540]   How did I not know, right?
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.420]   And so if you have not gotten yourself to a point
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.820]   where you're bringing in your faith
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.120]   and you're bringing in the facts
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.340]   and you haven't really looked around to see what's going on,
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.780]   I would like to inform you as a researcher of trends
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.380]   what is happening in the Christian community, okay?
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.380]   And so I'm not talking about
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.180]   the entire United States of America.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.980]   I'm talking about within the church
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.700]   of the United States of America.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.660]   Very broadly speaking,
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.300]   I wanna inform you of what is developing.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.780]   And so here are the two things.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.700]   There are two ideologies, two mentalities,
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:39.820]   two strategies that Christians are being led into.
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.820]   I believe you can sincerely and defensively
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:48.020]   be led into either of them, okay?
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.060]   Two strategies, and Christian leaders
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.820]   are flocking to one of the two, all right?
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.260]   Here's the first one.
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.220]   You say, I cannot in good conscience
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.660]   vote for either of these people, okay?
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.380]   Donald Trump, because he is not sober-minded,
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.200]   slow to speak, well thought of by outsiders,
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.940]   or generally anything else that Titus I
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.460]   or 1 Timothy 3 say a leader should be.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.700]   And so I cannot in good conscience
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.440]   possibly elect this man president.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.580]   Or because of Hillary's secretary,
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.020]   I should say respectfully, Secretary Clinton's policies
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:23.580]   on the unborn are not biblically defensible.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:27.260]   I cannot possibly, I cannot possibly install someone
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.540]   as president who authorizes and indeed encourages
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.660]   and removes restrictions toward and empowers
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.600]   the destruction of 1 million little lives per year.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.440]   I can't do it.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.520]   And so what lots of Christian leaders are doing,
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.320]   this is camp number one, is they're saying,
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.800]   I cannot vote for either of these leaders.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.540]   And so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to write
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.840]   in someone else's name.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.640]   Like David Marvin, I'm just kidding.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.920]   So I am going to write in someone else's name.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.640]   I cannot support either of these leaders.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.480]   So I am going to write in someone else's name.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.160]   If this is in your camp, here are some of the things
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.520]   you're probably likely to say.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.420]   You're probably gonna say, I view my vote as a statement.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.060]   A statement, because after all,
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.240]   the third person is probably not gonna win.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.860]   The name that you write down is probably not going to win.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.640]   They don't have enough votes from the populace
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.400]   or the electoral college to be voted in as president.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.800]   And so what I'm going to do is I am going to write in a vote
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.320]   for someone who's probably not going to be elected,
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.000]   but that is my statement to culture
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.360]   that Christians were here, people of the faith were here,
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.260]   we voted according to Christian conscience,
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.800]   and let it be said that so-and-so got my vote,
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.900]   because I, for one, want to keep my ability
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.280]   to vote on the basis of moral character in the future.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.680]   And I wanna be able to say to my kids,
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.320]   I voted for righteousness.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.720]   And I know until Jesus himself runs for office,
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.320]   we're always gonna vote for the lesser of two evils.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.880]   But I voted for someone who was relatively righteous.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.580]   And so if that's you, you would say,
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.320]   I can in good conscience vote for either of these people,
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.540]   and you would write in a third vote.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.460]   That's what one group of Christian leaders
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.620]   and Christian people are doing.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.720]   Here's the second one.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.880]   You say, okay, wait, not so fast, guys.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.160]   If you vote for someone who's not going to get elected,
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.960]   that makes it that much easier for the more dangerous
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.860]   of Trump and Clinton to be elected.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.720]   You're taking yourself out of the hunt,
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.720]   and you're paving the way to the more dangerous person
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.680]   who would lead this country closer to disaster.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.640]   And so while you may be really good on principle,
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.560]   you may be a little short on practical,
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.980]   because what you might do is you might open the door
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.940]   for someone to take control that will lead this country
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.920]   in a direction that will not lead to life.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.920]   And so if you're in this camp,
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.120]   you might say, hey, guys that are writing in a third party,
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.620]   I love your resolve,
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.280]   but I wish you thought a little more practically.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.240]   And if you were over here on the third party right end,
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.480]   you might say, hey, guys, I love your pragmatism,
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.240]   but are you sure you're not afraid?
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   And thus goes the dialogue, all right?
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.860]   If you are here and you choose,
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.520]   what you are gonna choose to do
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.920]   is you're gonna choose to vote.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.400]   Rather than writing a third party candidate,
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.360]   you are going to learn to try to live with
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.960]   one of the two alternatives
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.080]   just to prevent the worst alternative from seizing power.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.000]   And so if this is you,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.200]   you would say my vote's not an endorsement.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.500]   I don't endorse this person,
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.280]   not personally, not politically.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.400]   And I can't support every single thing
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.220]   that they're going to do,
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.200]   but what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to protect America.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.360]   And if this is you, what you would probably say is,
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.920]   you would probably make note of the fact
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.800]   that the next president is going to appoint,
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.820]   likely, the next Supreme Court justices,
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.840]   which comprise the group of the nine most powerful,
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.660]   collectively, people in the United States.
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.140]   And you would say,
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.660]   those justices are going to long outlast this president,
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.500]   this next president.
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.980]   And so the influence of the next president
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.260]   is long going to outlast their presidency.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.780]   And I'm going to protect America by taking my chances
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.940]   on Clinton or Trump
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.920]   because I can't bear the thought of the alternative.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.860]   All right?
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.860]   So you can write in, these are the broad trends.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.380]   You can write in a third party vote and say,
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.500]   a vote for righteousness is never a vote wasted.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.620]   Or you could vote for either Trump or Clinton
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.220]   because you just cannot bear to see America entrusted
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.420]   to the alternative.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:18.840]   That is what is happening as an observer.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.780]   And I believe that Christians can be led there,
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:27.780]   intelligibly, defensively, and sincerely.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:31.580]   What I am telling you to do tonight is get somewhere,
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.700]   intelligibly, sincerely, and defensively.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.220]   Act, bring in the faith, bring in the facts,
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.640]   and make your choice.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.020]   Now listen, I wrestled with this all the way up
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.440]   until 6.30 p.m., no lie,
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.940]   about whether I was just going to tell you
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.380]   who I am voting for.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.220]   All right?
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.220]   And I just thought, maybe I'm just going to tell them,
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.780]   maybe I'm not, what's the ups, what's the downs?
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.980]   And so here's what we landed on.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.700]   I don't want to tell you right now who I'm going to vote for
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.280]   because I'm afraid that that will keep you
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.180]   from doing the homework I just exhorted you to do.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.980]   And so I believe that you may be tempted,
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.580]   if I tell you who I'm going to vote for,
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.500]   that you may be tempted to use my logic
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.540]   and my process as a substitute for your own.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.100]   And so I'll tell you what, if you want to know,
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.220]   and it's important for you to know,
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.020]   and sincerely, if I can assist you this very evening,
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.300]   if you want to know how I voted,
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.480]   you can meet me right there as soon as the sermon's over,
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.140]   and I will tell you, no questions asked.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.300]   And so you all have permission to know who I'm voting for,
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.140]   but I am not going to say it at this particular moment
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.820]   because I don't want you to think
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.980]   that you don't have to bring in your Christian conviction
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.660]   and that you don't have to do your work
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.620]   and your research and your thoughts
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.100]   and work this out with fear and trembling
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.960]   as the scripture says, to work out your salvation.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.660]   Let me close with a story.
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:45.620]   In 1787, the United States was not in a great place
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:46.780]   because the United States,
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.300]   which was designed to have a small government,
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.120]   don't know if you know that,
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.500]   but America was designed to have a small central government,
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.540]   and it's not a jab at anybody,
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:58.100]   but America was designed to have a small central government.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.740]   We aimed too small, and we crafted a document
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.820]   before the US Constitution that was not strong enough
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.980]   to lead, do you remember what it was called?
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.060]   Articles of Confederation, exactly.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.500]   And so the Articles of Confederation
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.000]   were letting the United States fall apart.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.620]   And so delegates from 13 states met at Independence Hall
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.180]   in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in a small room,
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.180]   a room that I've actually gotten a chance to visit,
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:23.020]   and they worked for 100 days to try to get
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.760]   a form of government that would be acceptable
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.540]   and appropriate for this new country
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.420]   who had just somehow won a war
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.740]   against the most impressive military power of the day,
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.620]   which would be England,
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.140]   and become their own country only to soon fall apart.
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.780]   And so they are inside this room,
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.820]   fighting for days and days that turned into weeks
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.820]   that turned into over three months.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.900]   And imagine, if you're inside, it's quite a process.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.980]   And so you've got all the founding fathers going at it.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.140]   You got Ben Franklin standing up saying,
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.140]   "Guys, we need to pray."
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.420]   And we're like, "You don't even believe in God."
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.660]   And Ben Franklin even wants to pray.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.220]   This must be really important.
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.140]   And so if you are inside the building,
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.100]   that's what you're seeing.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.980]   But imagine if you're outside the building.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.140]   The United States Constitution
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.940]   has never been written to your knowledge.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.660]   There's never been a democratic,
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:14.660]   we the people government ever in the history of the world.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.620]   And so you, not successfully.
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:20.060]   And so you do not have any idea
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.320]   what's gonna come out of that room.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.860]   But you know that there are a few guys in there
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.380]   that are about to decide your fate
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.720]   when they decide who is leading.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.360]   And they break after 100 days and walk outside.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.200]   And one of these citizens
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.040]   who had to have been looking on with wonder,
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.720]   named Mrs. Powell, who we don't know for any other reason,
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.220]   except this one conversation,
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:46.320]   walked up to Benjamin Franklin, 81 years old at the time.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.360]   And she asked the question that was on everybody's mind
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.640]   in these 13 United States.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.480]   She said, "Dr. Franklin, what do we have?"
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.560]   A monarchy or a republic?
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:05.440]   Meaning, who's leading this place?
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.440]   And Ben Franklin looked back at her and he said,
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.820]   a republic madam, if you can keep it.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:16.520]   A republican madam, if you can keep it.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:22.880]   You, madam, have not a republican, not a democratic person,
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.400]   but you have a republic that you are responsible to keep.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.720]   In other words, "Dr. Franklin, who is leading this place?"
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.320]   Answer, Mrs. Powell, you are.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.560]   You are the leaders.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.000]   For the first time in all of world history successfully,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.840]   we are going to break, we being the people of power,
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.960]   are going to break out of the huddle of power
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.040]   and we are gonna hand the entire reins of leadership
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.280]   back to the people that no one knows.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.800]   We are gonna let the American people be
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.480]   what we set out to be, which is self-led.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.600]   And in seven days, we are going to be self-led again.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:03.000]   Self-led, that means you are all leaders.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.920]   If you get to choose the leader, that makes you the leader.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.560]   If the leader is accountable to you,
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.120]   then that means you are the leader.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.440]   And the decision is tough.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.500]   I don't wanna be simplistic.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.880]   I hope that wasn't simplistic.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.120]   And I'll tell you this,
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.620]   it is hard to make a decision like that.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.200]   You're like, "Oh man, we wanted to be self-led.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.160]   "We didn't wanna make hard decisions in limited time
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.060]   "about imperfect people from a distance.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.160]   "We just wanted to be self-led."
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.080]   Well, that is leadership.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.320]   So welcome to leadership.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.700]   That is your decision that you have to make.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.140]   You are in charge.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.820]   And I hope you are really, really well-led.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.400]   Let me pray that you would be.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:48.520]   Father, I pray that you would make these friends
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.560]   and these that are in Houston and Fort Worth
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.780]   and listening elsewhere, God,
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:56.780]   that you would make us well-led by you first.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.200]   That we would not even put our hope in a government.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.720]   That we'd be thankful for the freedoms
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.680]   that you have allowed us to exercise,
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.020]   that you haven't allowed us by your grace
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.340]   to prosper as a country for these 240 years.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.920]   But I pray, God, that our hope would not be
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.160]   in red, white, and blue,
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.360]   but it would only be in your sovereign grace, God.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.600]   Make us think as our forefathers thought, God.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.640]   They felt like owners.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.760]   They felt like participants.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.880]   They felt like it depended on them because it does.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.720]   And it did.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.160]   And so, God, for whatever the future of the country
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.000]   depends on these votes,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.440]   we know ultimately it only depends on your sovereign
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.180]   and good and gracious will.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.600]   And so will you bring us, God,
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.560]   individually more into concert
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.660]   with what you would have us do,
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.040]   more in step with your will for our lives personally.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.120]   Long before we vote,
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.920]   will we consider where we stand with you, God,
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.880]   and only you.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.700]   And will you lead us.
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.280]   Will you teach us wisdom in the secret heart.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.720]   Will you help us to exalt you, God, with our vote.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.240]   I am confident, God, that you can lead us.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:04.440]   I'm confident, God, that you don't need
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.400]   the speech or the words of man,
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.000]   but rather your power is made perfect in our weakness.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.280]   And so weakly as a country and as a ministry,
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.020]   we bow ourselves before you and say, God, be our leader.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.520]   Will you lead us well?
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.140]   Will you help us to know?
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.800]   How to choose a leader
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.240]   because we've seen your leadership.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.840]   In Jesus name, amen.
