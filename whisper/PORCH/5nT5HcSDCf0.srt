 - Love it, how fun was that?

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,320
 Hey, I'm gonna start with reading the passage

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,600
 in First Peter that we're checking out tonight.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,040
 So you guys open if you have a Bible to First Peter with me

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,760
 and I will read it and then pray and we'll dive in.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,620
 First Peter chapter one, starting in verse six is this,

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,560
 Peter writing, "In this,"

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,080
 talking about the eternal inheritance

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,960
 JP talked about last week, "you rejoice,

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,000
 "though now for a little while, if necessary,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,720
 "you have been grieved by various trials,

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,960
 "so that the tested genuineness of your faith,

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,700
 "more precious than gold that perishes,

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,040
 "though it, like your faith, is tested by fire,"

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,140
 not by trials,

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,280
 "may be found to result in praise and glory

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,920
 "and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ,"

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
 or when Jesus comes back.

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,400
 "Though you have not seen him, Jesus, you love him.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,840
 "Though you do not see him now, you believe in him

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
 "and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,960
 "and filled with glory,

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,140
 "obtaining the outcome of your faith,

30
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,400
 "the salvation of your souls.

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
 "Concerning this salvation, the prophets,"

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,660
 that's the Old Testament,

33
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,720
 "who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours,

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,520
 "searched and inquired carefully,

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,840
 "inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,640
 "was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ,"

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,120
 in the Old Testament, "and the subsequent glories.

38
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,060
 "It was revealed to them," the prophets,

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,380
 "that they were serving not themselves

40
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,680
 "in the things that have now been announced to you

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,280
 "through those who preached the good news to you

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,920
 "by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven."

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,160
 Things, this whole storyline,

44
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,720
 things into which angels long to look.

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,560
 Let me pray, we'll dive in.

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,640
 Father, we thank you for your word.

47
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,040
 We thank you just for the words of Peter.

48
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,680
 And we thank you that you take fishermen

49
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,080
 who are broken, sinful men like Peter

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,160
 and sinful men like me,

51
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,880
 and you offer us grace and you offer us new life.

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,080
 We pray that the words that Peter, who you called the rock,

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,840
 would sharpen our hearts, would instruct us,

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,680
 would encourage us in the midst of trials that we face,

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,240
 in the midst of just this world around us,

56
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,520
 that he would allow your word to just pierce

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,720
 into whatever we're facing right now.

58
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,760
 For friends that are listening either online

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,880
 or friends in Houston and Fort Worth

60
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,200
 and all over the country that are tuning in with us,

61
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,880
 Lord, that you would do the same there.

62
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,520
 Lord, we leave here more in love with Jesus.

63
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,680
 What a tragedy it would be to come to church

64
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,000
 and go through the motions and not love you more

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,960
 and not know you more.

66
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,160
 Would that happen now, Lord?

67
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,400
 For anyone who doesn't know you, would you open eyes,

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,000
 allow the hearts of those inside of this room

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,240
 who don't know you to be softened,

70
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,440
 and would you stretch out your hand

71
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,760
 and do what only you can do, which is save people.

72
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,600
 We love you.

73
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,760
 Thank you for Jesus, amen.

74
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,720
 I was gonna start with a little story

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
 that happened not too long ago.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I guess it was a few years now,

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,360
 but it was when I was engaged to my wife, Callie.

78
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,200
 So when you get engaged, you buy the engagement ring,

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,600
 you get down on one knee, and then you propose,

80
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,920
 and hopefully they say yes,

81
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,480
 and then you're officially engaged.

82
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,240
 There's another piece of jewelry

83
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
 that is involved when you get engaged.

84
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,280
 Anyone know what it is called?

85
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,120
 A wedding, okay, guys, you're gonna need to know this, man.

86
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,000
 There's something called a wedding band

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,760
 that once you get engaged, the game is not over.

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,080
 You also not only have an engagement ring

89
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,480
 you're proposing with, but on the day of the wedding,

90
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,120
 you place not the engagement ring,

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
 but a wedding band on side of this person

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,760
 or on side of your fiance.

93
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,700
 And so my wedding was coming up,

94
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,900
 I needed to get a wedding band.

95
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,420
 I had recently got engaged, and my fiance, Callie,

96
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,040
 said my grandmother has some diamonds

97
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,560
 that she wanted to give to whoever got engaged to me

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,480
 for this wedding band.

99
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,380
 I'm like, dude, holla at you.

100
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,600
 Boy, this girl comes with diamonds, awesome.

101
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,560
 And so I'm like, this is great, man, I love it.

102
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,320
 Grandma knows, working on a budget.

103
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,960
 I'll take those, I take the diamonds, this is awesome.

104
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,160
 Take a new jewelry, they put 'em on this band,

105
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
 and I'm all set, ready to go.

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,840
 I'm making sure this very expensive, valuable,

107
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,480
 thousands of dollars, more expensive than anything I owned,

108
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,800
 I make sure that I keep this in a very, very safe place

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
 and make sure that it's ready for the wedding day.

110
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,000
 Wedding day comes, ceremony takes place,

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,760
 everything goes great, put it on her hand,

112
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,040
 everything's great, go to the honeymoon, married.

113
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,080
 It's awesome.

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,760
 Come back from the honeymoon a few weeks later

115
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,140
 and realize that, oh my gosh,

116
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,440
 we need to go get that wedding band appraised

117
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,640
 because if we lose grandma's diamonds,

118
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,360
 we are not replacing grandma's diamonds.

119
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,560
 If something happens or they break off,

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,640
 if it's not insured, then we won't be able to replace it.

121
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,680
 So in order to get it insured,

122
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,760
 you gotta go get it appraised,

123
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,540
 jeweler says, oh, it's worth this much,

124
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,300
 turn this into the insurance company.

125
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,040
 So we go to the jewelry store, get there,

126
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,200
 hand 'em the diamond, hand 'em the wedding band,

127
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,460
 they take it back, they look at it,

128
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,300
 all of a sudden the guy's like,

129
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,960
 oh man, I'm gonna have to take this back to the back.

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,160
 Goes back to the back, does, I'm not exactly sure what,

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,120
 but he looks at it and he just said,

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,480
 man, we're inspecting it, put it underneath this microscope.

133
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,640
 And he comes back and he says, these are fake diamonds.

134
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,560
 (laughing)

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,280
 Yeah, I know, and he's like, grandma, are you serious?

136
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,520
 You gave us fake diamonds?

137
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,640
 And I'm like, no, that can't be right,

138
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
 you must be mistaken.

139
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,400
 He's like, I looked at 'em, these are not real diamonds.

140
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,680
 These are fake, they're worthless.

141
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,240
 And I'm like, okay, worthless, ouch,

142
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,720
 even fake ones are worth nothing.

143
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,680
 And the reason I start with that

144
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,040
 is because just like in that scenario

145
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,360
 where we had been carrying around,

146
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
 I mean, my wife had this band on

147
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,240
 that she'd been carrying around on herself,

148
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,020
 something that she thought was incredibly value,

149
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,400
 she was taking everywhere that she went,

150
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
 she thought it was of incredible value,

151
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,380
 and it ended up being totally fake and worthless.

152
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,400
 And the apostle Peter tonight is gonna say

153
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,440
 that for many of us or for many people,

154
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,860
 based on what he lays out in terms of faith,

155
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,040
 when it comes to the thing that they're carrying around

156
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,380
 they think is faith, he would say it's fake, it's worthless.

157
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,840
 And as tragic as it is to get a wedding band

158
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,040
 that you end up discovering,

159
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,720
 oh my gosh, these are fake diamonds,

160
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,240
 how much more tragic would it be to go

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,640
 and at the end of your life realize

162
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,200
 that the thing that you said was faith,

163
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 some belief in God or some prayer

164
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,700
 that you had prayed when you were younger

165
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,500
 and you thought you possessed this faith that was true,

166
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,640
 never was.

167
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,120
 And so tonight, he's gonna lay out what true faith,

168
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,000
 what the qualities of true faith look like.

169
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
 If you take notes, you can write down

170
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,400
 the qualities of true faith as he just instructs us

171
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,200
 on some of the attributes that if a person is to have faith,

172
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,000
 what they're gonna experience and what makes up

173
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,720
 what true faith looks like when it's displayed.

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
 Specifically, what he's gonna tell us

175
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,260
 is how true faith is refined,

176
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,640
 how true faith is defined,

177
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,880
 and then what true faith focuses on.

178
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,480
 So we'll start in verse six and pick up right

179
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,680
 where we left off and continue going there

180
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,520
 and read it again.

181
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
 Here's what he says.

182
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
 In this, again, talking about the eternal inheritance

183
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,640
 that we covered last week, if you missed it,

184
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,600
 check out the Porch app, go listen to J.P.'s message.

185
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,560
 It was incredible.

186
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,280
 Make sure that you catch it and stay tuned with us

187
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,400
 as we go through 1 Peter.

188
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,080
 But he says, "In this, eternal inheritance, you rejoice,

189
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,580
 "though now for a little while,

190
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,720
 "you have been grieved by various trials."

191
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
 So he's writing to an audience of Christian.

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,000
 He's saying, look, there's gonna be an eternal inheritance,

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,460
 but right now in this life,

194
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,600
 you're gonna walk through all kinds of trials.

195
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
 What do they do in your life?

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,640
 So that the tested genuineness of your faith,

197
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,260
 that they begin to test your faith,

198
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,560
 which is more a faith more precious than gold,

199
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,360
 that perishes, though it is also like faith,

200
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,640
 tested by fire, may be found a result, your faith,

201
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,700
 in praise and glory and honor

202
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,040
 at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

203
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,920
 What did Peter just say?

204
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,580
 Peter just said that for believers inside of Christianity,

205
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,920
 when you become a Christian,

206
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,260
 God does not promise that he's gonna protect you from pain,

207
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,680
 but he promises a purpose in the pain in your life,

208
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,960
 in the pain in my life,

209
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
 that he doesn't promise like,

210
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,400
 hey, you become a Christian, you sign up,

211
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,300
 everything's gonna be great from here on out.

212
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,020
 He doesn't promise protection from pain.

213
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,100
 He promises a purpose for your pain.

214
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,740
 And that is that trials are the thing

215
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,140
 that will refine and purify,

216
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,740
 will test and prove your faith to be true.

217
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,600
 The first idea from the text is that true faith

218
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,980
 is refined by trials.

219
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,740
 True faith, if you have true faith,

220
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,520
 it is something that will be refined

221
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,820
 by the trials inside of your life,

222
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,780
 no matter how big, no matter how small.

223
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,920
 I mean, Christianity, this is why people,

224
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,420
 the idea even Peter introduces that,

225
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,220
 man, you're going to face trials.

226
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,960
 There's gonna be things in your life that fall apart.

227
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,900
 Singleness, a parent who divorced,

228
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,960
 the loss of a loved one, cancer,

229
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,500
 the loss of a loved one, cancer,

230
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,240
 whatever it is, Peter's gonna say you're gonna face.

231
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,740
 This is why the idea that if you follow Jesus,

232
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,140
 and man, I wish this was true,

233
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,100
 it'd make life so much easier, wouldn't it?

234
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,200
 Hey, if you follow Jesus,

235
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,840
 everything's gonna be great in your life.

236
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,980
 You're gonna be healthy, wealthy, wise,

237
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,820
 it's all gonna be great.

238
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
 It's just a lie.

239
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,340
 It's something called the prosperity gospel.

240
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,860
 It just flies in the face of the New Testament teaching

241
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,960
 or of Peter, who got crucified upside down,

242
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,500
 who would say, man, if you follow Jesus,

243
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,360
 he doesn't promise protection from the pain in this world,

244
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,300
 but he does promise a purpose towards it.

245
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,800
 And one of the primary purposes

246
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,700
 is that he will use it to refine the faith

247
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,540
 that you and I have.

248
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,340
 And he uses this illustration that, man, I just love.

249
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,500
 It's brilliant, of Peter.

250
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,520
 He says, just like gold is tested and refined in the fire,

251
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,280
 faith is tested and refined in trials of life.

252
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,380
 Whatever hard thing you're going through right now

253
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,160
 is something that God will use

254
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,560
 if we allow him to refine and grow our faith,

255
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,860
 grow our trust in him.

256
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,960
 And he uses the fire thing.

257
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,160
 Here's why the fire thing's brilliant.

258
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,260
 Here's the word that he uses for tested,

259
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,400
 both on your faith and with gold in the fire.

260
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,600
 It's a metalsmith word or a goldsmith word

261
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,060
 that was used at this time.

262
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,260
 And it was a word that basically mean,

263
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,840
 it was the process by which gold would be refined.

264
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,940
 Here's how gold gets refined.

265
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,000
 Take a piece of gold, heat up this oven,

266
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,480
 get it real, real hot, put the piece of gold in there,

267
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
 let it boil a little bit, pull it out,

268
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,820
 and all of a sudden the impurities rise to the top.

269
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,080
 They wipe off the impurities.

270
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
 You may have heard it called dross.

271
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,120
 That's what that is.

272
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,160
 They stick it back in, make it even hotter.

273
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,180
 The impurities continue to rise to the top,

274
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,220
 scrape them away.

275
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,200
 You know when they know that the gold has been tested

276
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
 or has been purified?

277
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
 When you can see, or the goldsmith can see his reflection

278
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,940
 in the gold.

279
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,200
 When he can see it clearly,

280
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,600
 he knows that the gold has been tested.

281
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,700
 Why is that significant?

282
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,000
 It's the same thing that Christ does through trials,

283
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,840
 through all of life,

284
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
 or is working towards in everyone who says they're a

285
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,540
 Christian or everyone who is a Christian.

286
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,680
 Where he is working about and bringing all things

287
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,880
 for the good of those who love him to be conformed.

288
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,120
 He's trying to make his reflection in your life

289
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,300
 more evident, more clear.

290
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,060
 What God is doing through trials in your life

291
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,760
 and all of your life if you're a Christian,

292
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,720
 is he's trying to make his reflection,

293
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,920
 when he looks into and sees your life,

294
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,520
 that it would more clearly reflect his reflection.

295
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,400
 Peter says that's what trials inside of our life are doing.

296
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,320
 That he's using it to make us to more clearly see

297
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,760
 the presence of God in our life.

298
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,180
 I think when I read this, I'm like,

299
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,480
 man, I both want to become more refined,

300
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,360
 at the same time I'm like,

301
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,400
 can we do it without the whole fire thing or the trial thing?

302
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,920
 And it's crazy that the things, the faith,

303
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,000
 I wanna have big faith,

304
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,720
 but I don't wanna have the circumstances that require it.

305
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,260
 I have a friend who I was talking to today,

306
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,500
 and we were talking about this first,

307
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,680
 and I was like, man, I wanna know that this is true,

308
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,080
 'cause you're walking through the fire of trial.

309
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,540
 He's a 26-year-old guy on our staff.

310
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,700
 He has a four-week-old daughter that four weeks ago,

311
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,520
 they went to the hospital, they're so pumped,

312
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,020
 first baby, everything's excited,

313
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,260
 fast driving to the hospital,

314
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,020
 we're getting there, it's all gonna be great.

315
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,340
 And the delivery takes place,

316
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,740
 and she was 100% healthy, the baby, beforehand.

317
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,580
 And in the delivery of the baby, his little baby girl,

318
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,060
 she breathed in fluid

319
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,260
 that she should not have breathed in.

320
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,420
 And she ends up having to be life-flighted

321
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,220
 to Children's Hospital.

322
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,660
 And for the next four weeks, she's been fighting for her life

323
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,460
 and I was asking John, his name's John,

324
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,860
 and I was like, dude, tell me how this is true.

325
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,080
 How have you seen God grow you?

326
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,020
 How have you seen more?

327
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,540
 How has he refined your faith in the midst of this?

328
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,100
 Just tell me what this is like,

329
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,020
 'cause honestly, the trials in my life,

330
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,620
 they pale in comparison to what you're going through.

331
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,380
 And he said, man, I remember I was sitting there,

332
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,760
 we were on the 12th floor of this children's building,

333
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,060
 and I was praying to God.

334
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,660
 And it was when we thought she was gonna die.

335
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,260
 And she's doing better now,

336
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,660
 and she's still been on the oxygen machine

337
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,900
 and on the life machine.

338
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,980
 And he said, I was sitting there, but this was then.

339
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,780
 And we were thinking that she wasn't gonna make it,

340
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,900
 and I'm just praying, God,

341
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,500
 this is either gonna push me away from you,

342
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,960
 or it's gonna push me towards you.

343
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,580
 And I don't want it to push me away from you, God.

344
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,560
 Will you please, Lord,

345
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,420
 will you help my unbelief in the midst of this?

346
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,400
 Will you help me?

347
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,740
 And he said it was like through prayer

348
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,860
 on side of that floor that God began to reveal,

349
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,980
 and he began to be confronted with the idea that, man,

350
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,460
 Jesus, he's either enough or he's not.

351
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,060
 And Lord, I believe that you're enough.

352
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,220
 I believe you're a good father,

353
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,380
 that I can ask you, Lord, save my daughter.

354
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,180
 But I believe that you're enough.

355
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,140
 Jesus, you're enough.

356
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,060
 And he said, in a new way that I could have told you

357
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,100
 and answered on test, Jesus is enough.

358
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,580
 But in a new way that wasn't just words,

359
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,180
 I came to realize that he is.

360
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:41,020
 And in the midst of trials, we more clearly see that.

361
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,920
 In the midst of trials,

362
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,660
 JP and I were talking a few minutes ago backstage

363
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,240
 of what's crazy about trials is like faith shines brightest

364
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,320
 in the darkness of trials, doesn't it?

365
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,260
 Like nobody in here, if you're like going through a season

366
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,260
 of like singleness or job challenges

367
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,600
 or like divorce of your parents,

368
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,420
 that's when faith is like most needed

369
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,980
 and most shines brightly.

370
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,720
 When you walk by faith in those circumstances,

371
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,020
 it's like a wonder to the rest of us.

372
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,260
 Nobody's like, oh my gosh, it takes so much faith

373
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,340
 to be the pretty girl who gets married

374
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,100
 and has like a full, you know, horde of children

375
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,300
 and you got the suburban,

376
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,180
 you got everything you want in life.

377
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,620
 And yeah, you're so beautiful.

378
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,100
 And yeah, I wish I looked like that too.

379
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
 It doesn't take as much faith to be X person

380
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,200
 or whatever the story.

381
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,220
 But those of us who walk through trials,

382
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,440
 it's staggering to a watching world.

383
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,620
 The person who says, look, my God is in the heavens

384
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,780
 and I trust the story he's writing my life.

385
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,660
 What else am I gonna do?

386
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,540
 That person, faith is most needed in the midst of trials.

387
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,780
 Faith most shines brightly.

388
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,340
 Trust is seen most clearly in the midst

389
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,460
 of trials around us.

390
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,700
 Whatever you're facing, God is at work to refine your faith.

391
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,080
 True faith is always refined in the midst of trials,

392
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,880
 whether it is singleness or it's job loss

393
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,920
 or whatever's in front of you.

394
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,220
 Maybe it's a relationship that just broke up.

395
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,480
 God says, are you gonna trust me with this?

396
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,600
 And if you will, I will use it to continue to refine,

397
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,360
 grow, strengthen your faith.

398
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,100
 True faith is refined in the fire.

399
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,720
 That's not only the thing that he says,

400
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,920
 he goes into what true faith is defined as

401
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,720
 and he gives us Peter's definition, if you will,

402
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,540
 of what it is.

403
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,380
 Here's what he says.

404
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,600
 Though you have not seen him, that's Christ,

405
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,760
 he begins to lay out one of the first parts of faith,

406
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,940
 which is uncertainty.

407
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,180
 You love Christ.

408
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,400
 Though you do not see him now,

409
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,160
 you believe or you trust in Christ.

410
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,440
 He gives us three qualities.

411
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,480
 And you rejoice, that's our third.

412
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,560
 So though you don't see him, you love him.

413
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,000
 Though you don't see him, you believe or you trust in him.

414
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,460
 And though you don't see him, you're filled with joy

415
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,080
 that's inexpressible, filled with glory,

416
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,960
 obtaining the outcome of your faith,

417
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,600
 the salvation of your souls.

418
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,920
 Our second point that Peter lays out tonight

419
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,880
 is that true faith is defined by love, trust, and joy,

420
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,720
 according to Peter.

421
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,800
 True faith is defined by love, trust, and joy.

422
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,020
 Here's what's interesting about the two words

423
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,760
 of love and trust that he uses.

424
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,160
 The first one on love, he doesn't use,

425
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,560
 he says somebody who has real faith,

426
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,880
 you wanna know who has real faith?

427
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,400
 It's someone who has this actual, genuine love for Christ,

428
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,120
 who has this actual, like, man, I really,

429
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,540
 at the end of the day, I love Jesus.

430
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,520
 Even if everyone else falls away, Lord,

431
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
 I really love you.

432
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,840
 He says that's one of the marks of it.

433
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,780
 But it's not just, it's not like the love

434
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,080
 that we think of when we think of love

435
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,920
 'cause our culture's kinda ruined it.

436
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,080
 Like, we think, like, oh man, the bachelor,

437
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,120
 and Nick, and this is so beautiful.

438
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,160
 And that's not what Peter's talking about,

439
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,340
 of this feeling of love.

440
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,520
 He uses a word that's a verb, this agape.

441
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,720
 It's a sacrificing love.

442
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,280
 He says you wanna know someone who genuinely has faith,

443
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,920
 true faith, is marked by three qualities.

444
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,760
 One of them is a love or a serving of Christ.

445
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,940
 One of the things that marks their life

446
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,680
 is that they have this love that moves them to serve,

447
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,280
 sacrifice, I'm servant of Christ.

448
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,400
 He says that's the first thing.

449
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,040
 Second thing is trust, which is also an action.

450
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,000
 Someone who has a true faith is someone who says,

451
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
 look, I trust you.

452
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,640
 I don't do it perfectly, but at the end of the day,

453
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,520
 my heart's desire is that I would trust you.

454
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,840
 I wanna trust you with tomorrow.

455
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,320
 I wanna trust you with my future.

456
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,560
 I wanna trust you with whatever you have

457
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,800
 in terms of my romance story, or will I ever get marriage?

458
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,360
 I'm gonna trust you with my job.

459
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,560
 I'm gonna trust you with whatever it is, my finances,

460
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,240
 how you say I should steward money,

461
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,560
 how you say I should handle sexuality.

462
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,400
 I trust you, Lord.

463
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,320
 I'm gonna do what you say.

464
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,520
 Peter says that someone who has true faith

465
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,440
 is marked by a genuine love or service of Christ,

466
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,120
 and a genuine trust, like I can trust him.

467
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,160
 Now, I'm not gonna do it perfectly, but I trust you, God.

468
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,000
 Help me to trust you more.

469
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,400
 And the third is this joy,

470
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,840
 that not just this happiness of today and tomorrow,

471
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,280
 but they're marked in life by this joy

472
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,280
 that's not based on circumstances from the world around us.

473
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,040
 It's a joy that comes from the eternal inheritance

474
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,520
 that awaits them, the eternity they're gonna spend with God.

475
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,620
 Someone said today that in the face of trials,

476
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,520
 Christians don't always immediately have joy,

477
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,820
 but they inevitably do.

478
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,640
 That in the face of trials,

479
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,960
 Christians don't always immediately, but inevitably,

480
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,040
 with time and with Christ working in their life,

481
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,440
 they look back and they see that God was at work

482
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,680
 in the midst of those trials.

483
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,180
 Now, I wanna pause here and talk about just quickly

484
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,880
 the idea of faith, 'cause here's what Peter just said.

485
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,960
 Hey, if you wanna be a Christian,

486
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,120
 you wanna have true faith,

487
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,520
 you need to love somebody you don't see,

488
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,640
 you need to trust somebody you don't see,

489
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,880
 you need to have joy that comes from somebody you don't see.

490
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,560
 And inside of this room, I know there's a lot of people,

491
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,120
 or there's at least some of us who are like,

492
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,080
 dude, this is why I don't think

493
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,320
 I'll ever become a Christian,

494
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,420
 'cause I'm kinda one of these like,

495
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,740
 I need to see it to believe it kind of people.

496
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,360
 Like, I want God to show up in my room,

497
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,400
 and if he comes like in a dream,

498
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,600
 I'll be like, oh, okay, I guess I'll go with you.

499
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,000
 And that's the kind of person that I need.

500
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I need some like hard proof, I need some facts,

501
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,900
 some evidence in order to believe in something.

502
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,080
 And I would say, man, you're not crazy.

503
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,240
 I just think you're a little bit disingenuous.

504
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,120
 I mean, you believe in things all the time

505
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,560
 without having cold, hard evidence.

506
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,160
 I was talking to a friend a couple of weeks ago,

507
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,560
 we were talking about just this idea,

508
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,240
 and I had the same, he was reluctant,

509
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
 he was like, man, I just like need hard proof,

510
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,880
 and we'll talk about that in a second,

511
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,260
 but I was like, dude, you believe things all the time

512
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,320
 that you don't have any proof for,

513
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,800
 that you've never seen firsthand.

514
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,640
 And he was like, what are you talking about?

515
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,520
 I was like, do you believe in George Washington?

516
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,440
 And he was like, yeah, duh, I believe,

517
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,540
 I'm like, you ever met George Washington?

518
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,580
 (congregation laughing)

519
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,980
 He's like, no.

520
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,800
 Hmm, you ever met anyone who met George Washington?

521
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,120
 No, dude, they're all dead, he lived like 200 years ago.

522
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,440
 Dude, you believe in George Washington by faith.

523
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,640
 I'm not even sure the guy lived.

524
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720
 He's like, he's on the coin, he has a house.

525
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,880
 That doesn't mean anything.

526
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,320
 Somebody like in the 1800s could have

527
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,600
 made this whole thing up.

528
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,920
 You believe by faith in George Washington, it's true.

529
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,680
 And when it comes to the message of Christianity,

530
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,760
 we don't just blindly, if you ever become a Christian,

531
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,680
 it won't be when you're just like, dude,

532
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,480
 I'll just blindly, I guess, go along with what seems crazy.

533
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,740
 Here's in my heart of hearts, where the things that,

534
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,880
 when I look at the evidence compelling around Christianity,

535
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,440
 because here's a secret, even pastors doubt.

536
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,960
 Even pastors go like, man, am I crazy?

537
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,160
 Is this like, is this just some good guy who showed up

538
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,800
 a long time ago and this whole thing is made up?

539
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,660
 And you know what makes me doubt my doubts?

540
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,160
 Like there's just certain undeniable things

541
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,440
 that I just can't escape.

542
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,760
 When I look at the world, there's no explanation

543
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,920
 other than that he wasn't just some good guy who showed up,

544
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,360
 who by the way, said crazy people things,

545
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,340
 if he's just some good guy, like, hey, I'm God.

546
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,360
 Nobody calls the guy who's like, hey, I'm God.

547
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,480
 That's a good guy right there, I love that guy.

548
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,600
 Come on, good guy.

549
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,440
 Nobody says that about the guy who claims to be God.

550
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,720
 Jesus showed up on the scene.

551
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,080
 You know what makes sense of the fact that you and I

552
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,340
 even know who this person was?

553
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,040
 The fact that 2,000 years ago, if he was just some guy,

554
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,720
 it wouldn't be his teachings.

555
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,040
 In other words, the reason that you and I,

556
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,400
 when I move towards doubt, the reason,

557
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,120
 when I look at the evidence, what explanation works

558
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,960
 other than he was a man who became,

559
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,160
 God who became a man who rose from the dead?

560
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,600
 Could it really be that, man, he was just some good teacher

561
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,400
 and like his good sayings really were promoted really well?

562
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,440
 That's lunacy.

563
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,120
 Jesus, a Jewish peasant from the armpit of Rome,

564
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,400
 a place on the map you can't even point to.

565
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,040
 And if you can, it's only for one reason.

566
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,560
 Either because the Middle East conflict

567
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,360
 or because Jesus was there.

568
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,400
 Jesus, who showed up on the scene,

569
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,720
 who was a man that taught things

570
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,440
 that other people had taught at the time.

571
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,760
 Like, hey, you should really be nice to people.

572
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,800
 Turn on the other cheek.

573
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,120
 Things that would have never made it out of the first century

574
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,420
 aside from one other teaching that he had,

575
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,760
 which was this, I will die and I will rise again.

576
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,520
 And hundreds, and listen to me right here.

577
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,320
 Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people,

578
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,880
 his followers, went to their deaths,

579
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,360
 not for what they said that they believed in.

580
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,560
 They went to their deaths.

581
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,060
 They were killed for what they said they saw.

582
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,200
 They said, I saw him die and I saw him buried

583
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,080
 and he came back alive.

584
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,200
 And the reason that we believe is not, hold on.

585
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,840
 The reason that they went to their deaths

586
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,680
 is not just 'cause they're like,

587
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,640
 man, I just believe in the movement, dude.

588
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,480
 This is, yeah, this is go love wins.

589
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,720
 It wasn't because of that.

590
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,000
 The reason they went to the death

591
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,400
 is because of what they said they saw.

592
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,680
 I saw him dead and he came back alive

593
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,000
 and you can kill me all you want.

594
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,760
 He came back alive and he said, if I trust in him,

595
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,680
 I'm gonna live forever.

596
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,280
 So I'm going with the guy who died and came back alive.

597
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,880
 Sorry, you can kill me.

598
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,280
 And that's how the movement began.

599
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,760
 (congregation applauding)

600
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,280
 People all the time go to deaths for what they believe in.

601
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,320
 That's what Jihad is.

602
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,440
 That's what terrorism is.

603
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
 They went to their deaths for what they said they saw.

604
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,640
 Today, here's what else is undeniable evidence.

605
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,320
 You and every person you interact with,

606
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,820
 every coworker you live next to,

607
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,880
 or every, we work next to,

608
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,640
 every person that you live in an apartment complex next to,

609
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,720
 they all dated their calendars 2017 years

610
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,880
 from a man who many say was just a good dude.

611
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,920
 This is a good dude, a little crazy, but good dude.

612
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
 That's insane.

613
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,360
 There's no explanation that would satisfy

614
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,520
 why you should even know about a Jewish peasant

615
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,880
 unless he was the man who said he was.

616
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,280
 And he came back alive.

617
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,960
 Like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of followers

618
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,280
 said that he did.

619
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,000
 What else is undeniable is that all over this planet,

620
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,420
 2 billion people claim to have had an experience with God

621
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,400
 in a real way through Jesus Christ.

622
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,480
 And here's what's crazy to me.

623
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,960
 This minister's maybe just to me,

624
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,780
 but when you get around,

625
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,180
 if you've ever traveled to other countries

626
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,040
 or other continents and you get around them

627
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,640
 and there's like brothers and sisters in Korea and Peru,

628
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,760
 and you come together sometimes through a translator

629
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,520
 and you begin to hear their stories

630
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,320
 and they're eerily similar to stories you hear all the time.

631
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,720
 They're, I mean like unsolved mystery stories.

632
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,680
 Like yeah, this happened a month ago.

633
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,920
 We had this church in from Korea

634
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,700
 and they were sharing their stories of young adults

635
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,680
 who said they grew up and they were kind of marginal

636
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,760
 in their faith, they went to college, something happened.

637
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,600
 Somebody told them about Jesus and their life changed.

638
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,760
 And you're like, dude, you don't even speak English.

639
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,960
 This is unbelievable.

640
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,520
 Christianity is not some American religion.

641
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,040
 It's changing on every continent.

642
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,080
 And what's undeniable, regardless of what you believe,

643
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,560
 is that on every continent in this world,

644
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,960
 every language that's being spoken with very few exceptions,

645
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,520
 every color of someone's skin,

646
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,800
 every status of what they make in terms of money,

647
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,560
 there are people who claim to be followers of Jesus Christ.

648
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,920
 What's undeniable is that inside of your heart

649
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,480
 and my heart is this human whole

650
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,560
 or this God-shaped whole, it's been said.

651
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,440
 That no amount of sex, no amount of alcohol,

652
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,720
 nothing can satisfy.

653
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,000
 What's undeniable is that this man, Jesus,

654
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,280
 changed everything.

655
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,160
 And you're either gonna say he was some, man,

656
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,760
 a really good guy who said crazy things or he was Lord,

657
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
 like 2 billion other people have.

658
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,200
 Like throughout the centuries,

659
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,160
 billions and billions of us have declared

660
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,640
 because it's the most reasonable explanation

661
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,880
 for what has happened.

662
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,080
 It's not just by some blind faith.

663
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,320
 We do walk by faith, but it is not a blind faith.

664
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,400
 And Peter says, if you're gonna walk by a true faith,

665
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,680
 you're gonna walk not by what you see, but what is unseen.

666
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,880
 You're gonna trust in the Lord.

667
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,840
 You're gonna love the Lord.

668
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,640
 You're gonna trust him and you're gonna have joy,

669
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,880
 not anchored in this world, but in the life to come.

670
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,920
 In him.

671
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,520
 And he continues with a third idea from this text

672
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,480
 where he says this, talking about the salvation

673
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,920
 that you and I have received.

674
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,080
 Concerning this salvation, verse 10, that the prophets,

675
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,800
 so now he talks about the Old Testament.

676
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,520
 So he takes a little bit of a left turn here

677
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,720
 and he begins to go like, hey, you know that salvation,

678
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,640
 it's unbelievable, let me tell you a little bit

679
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,480
 about this salvation that you and I have.

680
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,880
 And he says this, concerning this salvation,

681
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,760
 the prophets, or the Old Testament,

682
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,920
 that's where the prophets,

683
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,680
 that's where the prophets are found,

684
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,120
 who prophesied about the grace, they spoke beforehand.

685
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
 They were writing these things like, hey,

686
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,820
 the Messiah's gonna come, the Savior's gonna do these things

687
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,160
 and Peter brings it up.

688
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,880
 And they were prophesying about the grace

689
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,080
 that was to be yours.

690
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,200
 They searched and inquired carefully,

691
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,880
 inquiring or wondering as they wrote,

692
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,820
 what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them

693
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,680
 was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ

694
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,540
 and subsequent glories.

695
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,480
 It was revealed to them that they were serving

696
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,600
 not themselves, but you,

697
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,900
 and the things that have now been announced to you

698
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,700
 through those who preach the good news to you

699
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,540
 by the Holy Spirit.

700
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,720
 Peter, what are you saying?

701
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,560
 Here's what he just said.

702
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,640
 Hey, this salvation has been something

703
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,360
 that God has been writing about the entire time.

704
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,480
 The message of Christ coming and dying on a cross,

705
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,040
 and he says, and he brings up the prophets,

706
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,600
 basically he's saying like, hey, when Isaiah sat down,

707
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,120
 Isaiah's an Old Testament prophet.

708
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,600
 When he sat down to write, the Spirit of Christ

709
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,320
 essentially said, I want you to write this down.

710
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,600
 He will be bruised for our transgressions,

711
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,040
 wounded by his wounds, we will be healed.

712
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,080
 Speaking of Jesus, and Isaiah's going,

713
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,880
 okay, the Savior's gonna be wounded for our transgression.

714
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
 Yeah, and then write, he'll be born of a virgin.

715
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,200
 I want you to write that one down, okay?

716
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,920
 And then he'll be called Emmanuel,

717
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,760
 all these different things.

718
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,600
 And Isaiah, the scripture just said,

719
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,500
 all the prophets were wondering,

720
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,480
 I don't totally understand how this is all gonna work.

721
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
 I'm writing these prophecies about the Messiah,

722
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,480
 the Savior God's gonna send,

723
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,440
 who will both be God and killed, I don't understand.

724
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,160
 And he'll be the Savior of everyone who trusts in him,

725
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,940
 I don't understand, Peter just said.

726
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,320
 And then he says, it's not only something

727
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,400
 that they long to understand and long to know more of,

728
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,800
 even the angelic realm looks at the story

729
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,160
 of what we call the gospel of God becoming a man

730
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,260
 and dying for us, and they wonder at it.

731
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,900
 And the prophets looked and they searched

732
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,260
 and they just wanted to know how.

733
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,740
 They knew that God would send a Savior,

734
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,060
 they knew that God was gonna win,

735
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,520
 they just looked and they wanted to know how,

736
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,480
 Peter essentially says.

737
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,400
 It's not dissimilar to this.

738
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,920
 If you watch the Super Bowl,

739
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,580
 you may have experienced what I did,

740
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,920
 which is I watched the first half

741
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,780
 and then I turned off the Super Bowl,

742
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,740
 'cause I was like, dude, Brady, over the hill, man.

743
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,900
 This is unbelievable, buddy, you just gotta hang 'em up,

744
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,020
 hang those cleats up.

745
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,440
 And so we ended up watching another TV show,

746
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,780
 DVR'd the rest of the Super Bowl.

747
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,420
 Super Bowl ends, I have no idea what's going on,

748
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,780
 I all of a sudden look on social media,

749
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,540
 it's like Patriots win, I'm like, this is insane.

750
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,340
 They won, and I go back to look at my DVR

751
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,740
 and it cuts off the last five minutes of the game,

752
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,620
 also the best part of the game,

753
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,980
 where it's like, he's like diving for a catch

754
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,380
 and it literally cuts off.

755
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,540
 And so now I begin to like search,

756
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,980
 I'm like looking on YouTube, trying to find like,

757
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,540
 how did they, I wanna know, I know that they won already,

758
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,940
 but how did they win?

759
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,760
 Peter just said that the prophets in the angelic realm

760
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,520
 looked at the story that God was writing,

761
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,320
 even the prophets writing about how Christ

762
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,560
 would be crucified or how we would die,

763
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,640
 and they just wanted to know how this could all make sense,

764
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,720
 how could the Savior do these things and he win?

765
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,560
 I know he wins, I just want to know how.

766
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,480
 And the answer was through the cross of Christ,

767
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,320
 through the cross of Christ.

768
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,000
 Our third idea from the text is that true faith

769
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,280
 is faith in the work of Christ on the cross.

770
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,360
 That just like all of the Old Testament

771
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,840
 is centered on the cross of Christ,

772
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,060
 so all of true faith, if you're gonna have true faith,

773
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,200
 man, this is so huge, I hope you get this.

774
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,000
 It's gonna be at the epicenter of it,

775
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,140
 it's not gonna be faith in the idea

776
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,520
 of you being a good person,

777
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,220
 it'll be faith in the work of Christ on the cross

778
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,100
 on your behalf.

779
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:59,180
 The entire story of the Old Testament

780
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,440
 is all about the work of Christ on the cross.

781
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,980
 It's all been pointed to that.

782
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,220
 From beginning to end, all of it is meant to climax,

783
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,500
 meant to culminate in the story of God becoming a man,

784
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,140
 dying in your place on the cross.

785
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,280
 Every story points to it,

786
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,740
 there's prophecies all throughout it,

787
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,260
 every page points to Jesus

788
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,600
 and the work of Christ on the cross.

789
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,440
 If you don't believe me,

790
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,740
 there's examples of specific prophecies that point to it.

791
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,500
 Psalm 22 says that Jesus would be 1,000 years

792
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,940
 before he even was born.

793
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,500
 It said he would be crucified

794
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,300
 through his hands and through his feet.

795
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,500
 Crucifixion didn't even exist for another 600 years.

796
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,420
 Think about that.

797
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,340
 It's pointing to this day that it's coming.

798
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,900
 Isaiah 53 says that Christ, like we referred to earlier,

799
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,720
 would be crushed for our transgressions,

800
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,020
 that God would send a savior

801
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,460
 and he would die in our place

802
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,660
 all throughout the Old Testament.

803
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,620
 Jesus even says this on the road to Emmaus

804
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,900
 to some of his disciples who were like,

805
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,700
 "Yeah, I just don't understand how the Messiah could die."

806
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,980
 And he says this in Luke 24.

807
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,460
 "Foolish ones and slow of heart

808
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,600
 "to believe all the prophets have spoken.

809
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,780
 "Was it not necessary that the Christ

810
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,580
 "should suffer these things and enter into his glory

811
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,020
 "and beginning," Jesus begins with these two guys

812
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,880
 walking on the road,

813
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,820
 "beginning with Moses and all of the prophets

814
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,180
 "he interpreted them in all the scriptures,

815
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,420
 "the things that are concerning himself."

816
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,940
 That Jesus sits these guys down and he's like,

817
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,920
 "Look, on every page it points to me."

818
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,680
 Wait a second, Leviticus points to you?

819
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,500
 The sacrificial system,

820
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,820
 that blood would need to be spilled

821
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,980
 in order for man to be forgiven.

822
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,300
 It was always pointing to Jesus, the ultimate lamb of God.

823
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,220
 Even the stories point to him.

824
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,300
 Think about it, Noah.

825
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,540
 Think about the story of Noah.

826
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,320
 Okay, Noah, God shows up to Noah, says,

827
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,160
 "Hey, look, I'm gonna flood the earth.

828
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,360
 "I need you to build a piece of wood.

829
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,820
 "And I need you to tell everyone you can

830
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,660
 "about that piece of wood.

831
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,380
 "Tell them to get onto the wood, trust the wood."

832
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,080
 And when the floods came,

833
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,580
 everyone who trusted in this piece of wood

834
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,620
 that was lifted up was saved.

835
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,060
 What does that sound like?

836
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,420
 Everyone who trusted in this piece of wood,

837
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,940
 AKA a cross, was saved.

838
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,260
 The story of Moses.

839
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,060
 Moses, you've heard Charleston Heston,

840
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,580
 he goes into Egypt, Pharaoh's in there.

841
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,660
 Hey, let my people go.

842
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,500
 You've heard that story.

843
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,260
 What's the circumstance?

844
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,300
 It all points to Christ.

845
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,500
 God's people are in bondage, unable to save themselves.

846
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,060
 All of a sudden, a deliverer is sent in,

847
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,020
 and he alone, Moses, later to be named Jesus,

848
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,980
 goes in and delivers the people,

849
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,700
 just like Jesus shows up,

850
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,500
 and God's people who were in bondage to sin

851
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,140
 and Satan and death,

852
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,720
 and he becomes the deliverer who sets them free.

853
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,900
 The story of David.

854
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,620
 Think about this, David and Goliath, all right?

855
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,860
 So David and Goliath, you know, 16-year-old kid,

856
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,420
 five stones, kills a giant named Goliath.

857
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,660
 You know what the number five stands for in Hebrew?

858
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,060
 Hebrew has this numerical system

859
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,340
 where the numbers can point to words.

860
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,540
 The number five is grace.

861
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,620
 So David shows up, and he slays a giant with grace.

862
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,260
 What does that sound like?

863
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,580
 The same Jesus who showed up

864
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,860
 and didn't just slay Goliath, this nine-foot-tall person,

865
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,140
 but he slayed the giants of sin, Satan, and death,

866
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,960
 with what?

867
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,660
 With grace.

868
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,620
 All of it points to him, Jonah, the prophet,

869
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,620
 who goes three days, dies three days,

870
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,020
 in the belly of a well, is resurrected three days later,

871
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,260
 and goes and proclaims news.

872
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,700
 Every page of your Bible,

873
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,040
 it's always been pointing to Jesus.

874
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,420
 It all points to Jesus at every level.

875
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,920
 The Bible, if you were not raised in church,

876
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,980
 maybe it's your first time back in a while,

877
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,580
 the Bible is not this story of a bunch of good stories

878
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,420
 and good people.

879
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,180
 It's a story of a bunch of bad people,

880
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,000
 and one good guy named Jesus,

881
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,520
 and all the bad guys kill him.

882
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,620
 That's how bad we are.

883
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,020
 And whoever trusts in this one good person

884
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,860
 will have eternal life.

885
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,900
 It's not good people in heaven and bad people in hell.

886
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,680
 It's forgiven people in heaven.

887
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,640
 And there is one way to get forgiveness.

888
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,400
 That is by trusting in Christ alone,

889
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
 in his work on the cross, on your behalf,

890
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,560
 and on my behalf,

891
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,160
 in all of the pages of the Old Testament.

892
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,640
 They've always been pointing to it.

893
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,960
 If you were in this room,

894
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,520
 and you were putting your faith

895
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,180
 in what you do,

896
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,820
 and how you behave, in other words,

897
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,440
 like, hey, if I'm gonna go before God,

898
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,600
 the reason I'm gonna get to heaven,

899
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,960
 man, and you're gonna come down afterwards,

900
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,920
 we're gonna have this same combo.

901
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,640
 So just, I'll make it happen right here.

902
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,880
 We can all have together.

903
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,440
 If the reason you think you'll spend eternity with God

904
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,240
 is because you're a good person, you're not a Christian.

905
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,480
 That's not what Christianity teaches.

906
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,760
 That's not what Christians believe.

907
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,600
 Let me say it again.

908
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,200
 If you think you'll spend eternity with God

909
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,920
 because you're a good person, you are not a Christian.

910
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,720
 On the other side, it's true.

911
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,320
 If you think you cannot spend eternity with God,

912
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,560
 listen to me so closely, man,

913
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,320
 if you think you can't spend eternity with God

914
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,900
 because you're a bad person,

915
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,360
 you don't know what Christianity's about.

916
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,040
 The message of Christianity is that all of us are broken,

917
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,360
 and God sent his son on the cross to die for your sins

918
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,400
 as a payment for your sin, and he rose back alive.

919
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,480
 And what that showed us is that the payment cleared,

920
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,400
 the check cleared, was more than enough.

921
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,920
 That's the message of the gospel.

922
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,840
 That's why we worship in here every single week.

923
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,600
 It's not because we think that we're good people,

924
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
 that we figured it out,

925
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,720
 and we really have caught on putting ourselves together.

926
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,040
 We come in here every single week,

927
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,320
 and we worship the only one who ever had it together,

928
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,560
 the one who loves us in spite of everything wrong with us,

929
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,840
 who died in our place, who died in your place,

930
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,480
 not because you deserved it,

931
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,240
 but because you didn't, and you never could,

932
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,600
 but because he loved you.

933
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,080
 And you're either gonna trust in the cross of Christ

934
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,180
 and the work of cross and have true faith,

935
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,760
 or you're gonna buy into the biggest lie

936
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
 this world has ever been told,

937
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,560
 which is, man, just keep being good.

938
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,340
 God will love you.

939
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,160
 We took those diamonds,

940
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,840
 and I'll finish the story and land the plane.

941
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,280
 We took them back to that, we took them to another jeweler

942
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,120
 just to make sure like,

943
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,520
 hey, we shouldn't throw these things out

944
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,480
 just yet, let's confirm.

945
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,840
 And we had a test done, so we like paid,

946
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,200
 and hey, send it back and test.

947
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,560
 And here's how they test diamonds.

948
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,840
 They see how strong it is.

949
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,800
 They see how much pressure it can endure.

950
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,880
 In other words, they put it underneath,

951
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,040
 there's a hardness scale,

952
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,220
 and if it cracks or it scratches, then it's not a diamond.

953
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,120
 But if it withstands the pressure, then it is.

954
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,560
 And we paid, and they took it away,

955
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,400
 and they did this test, called us a week later,

956
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,360
 and they said, "These are real diamonds."

957
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,400
 Like they stood underneath the pressure, they didn't crack.

958
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
 These are real, we were wrong.

959
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,700
 These are genuine, the real thing.

960
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:39,480
 How can I know that I have like genuine, true faith?

961
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,720
 How can I know that I have the faith

962
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,280
 that will be able to stand underneath the pressure

963
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,880
 of this life, of eternity?

964
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,040
 How can I know that I have true faith?

965
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,760
 Peter would say, "If you have a faith

966
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,560
 "that in midst of trials, you press into God,

967
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,140
 "you don't run from Him."

968
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,440
 If you have a faith that's marked by like,

969
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,200
 "God, I love you, I'm not perfect,

970
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,240
 "I'm still broken, Lord,

971
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,780
 "and you're taking ground on my life,

972
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,260
 "but at the end of the day, I love you,

973
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,260
 "and I wanna do what you want.

974
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,020
 "Will you help me, Lord?

975
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,400
 "And I trust you, God.

976
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,320
 "My joy is found in you,

977
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,880
 "and perfectly, will you help me?"

978
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,320
 He says, "That's true faith."

979
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,440
 And if you're someone who has put your faith

980
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,520
 most importantly, not in what you do,

981
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,920
 but in the work of Christ on the cross,

982
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,000
 and His resurrection from the dead,

983
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,720
 you have true faith that will stand

984
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,760
 in the midst of the eternal fire,

985
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,380
 and in the midst of the showers or fires

986
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,560
 of this world and life.

987
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,920
 And pray that we would.

988
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,360
 Father, thank you that you don't demand something from us.

989
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,480
 Lord, you did something for us.

990
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,680
 You died in our place, you died in my place.

991
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,560
 Father, would the just truth of the reality of the gospel

992
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,440
 continue to take ground in my heart,

993
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,480
 in my friend's heart, for anyone inside of this room

994
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,920
 who still has bought into the lie

995
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,160
 that God wants them to earn their way to Him?

996
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,280
 Lord, would the hounds of heaven itself

997
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,600
 go after the hearts of those people?

998
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,640
 And would the Spirit of God come and press on them?

999
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,080
 Would they begin to trust not in what they do

1000
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,440
 or what they haven't done?

1001
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,360
 Maybe despite what they've done,

1002
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,560
 that they would put their faith in Christ alone.

1003
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,640
 You died in our place as payment for our sins,

1004
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,320
 and you offer us new life just like you rose again.

1005
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,200
 So shall we, God, we worship you now in song.

1006
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,400
 We are truly yours, forever yours.

1007
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,280
 We worship you because of that.

1008
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:46,280
