 Wow, this is awesome.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,240
 Porchies, hey!

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,440
 How we doing, we doing okay?

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,560
 Doing okay tonight?

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,780
 It is, it's really, really, really good to be here with you.

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,400
 My name is Jimmy and I'm actually a pastor right now

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,000
 at a church on the south side of Dallas,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,840
 but we have so much love for this church

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,240
 and especially for the porch

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,720
 and for David and the whole crew here.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,600
 So thanks for having me today.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,320
 You didn't have a choice, but thank you for it.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,320
 Nonetheless, I'm eager to get into the word with you

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,320
 in this series.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,780
 So if you have a Bible, get it out.

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,780
 We're gonna be in the book of Luke chapter 18.

26
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,700
 We got a lot of verses to cover.

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,320
 I'm gonna read it first.

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,800
 We're gonna pray and then we're gonna jump into things.

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,600
 Does that sound good?

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
 Yes, to the four of you, here we go.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,320
 Let me read it.

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,040
 Luke chapter 18, starting in verse one.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,200
 "And he told them a parable to the effect

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,660
 that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.

35
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,880
 He said, 'In a certain city, there was a judge

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,900
 who neither feared God nor respected man.

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,660
 And there was a widow in that city

38
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,520
 who kept coming to him and saying,

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,840
 "Give me justice against my adversary."

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,560
 For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself,

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,480
 "Though I neither fear God nor respect man,

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,560
 yet because this widow keeps bothering me,

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,880
 I will give her justice so that she will not beat me down

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,780
 by her continual coming."

45
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:11,680
 And the Lord said, "Hear what the unrighteous judge says.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,320
 And will not God give justice to his elect

47
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,880
 who cry to him day and night?

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,560
 Will he delay long over them?

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,960
 I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily.

50
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,020
 Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes,

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,720
 will he find faith on the earth?"

52
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,480
 He also told them this parable to some

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,280
 who trusted in themselves that they were righteous

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,860
 and treated others with contempt.

55
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,220
 Two men went up into the temple to pray,

56
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,040
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.

57
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,700
 The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus,

58
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,720
 "God, I thank you that I'm not like other men,

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,480
 extortioners, unjust, adulterers,

60
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,040
 or even like this tax collector.

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
 I fast twice a week, I give tithes of all that I get,

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,680
 but the tax collector standing far off

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,400
 would not even lift up his eyes to heaven,

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,920
 but beat his breast saying,

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,000
 "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,540
 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified

67
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,680
 rather than the other.

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,780
 "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,

69
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,720
 but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."

70
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,260
 Now, they were bringing even infants to him

71
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,820
 that he might touch them.

72
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,080
 And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,080
 But Jesus said to him, called them to him saying,

74
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,160
 "Let the children come to me and do not hinder them,

75
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,440
 for to such belongs the kingdom of God.

76
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,820
 Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive

77
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,280
 the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."

78
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,600
 That's God's word.

79
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,440
 Let's pray.

80
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,280
 Father, it is always a holy thing to come to your word.

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,200
 We don't come to it lightly.

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,980
 We come to it with an amount of sobriety

83
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,160
 because we know what it really is.

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,920
 We know that it's living.

85
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,280
 We know that it's active.

86
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,480
 We know that it's sharper than a sword,

87
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
 that it pierces us, it divides our motives.

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,000
 It susses us out, God.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,220
 It finds us out.

90
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,500
 It exposes us.

91
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,680
 It convicts us.

92
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
 And it is able to provide the wisdom to us,

93
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,340
 to lead us to salvation, Paul says.

94
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,600
 And we also understand that this word is,

95
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,220
 in the words of Paul, spiritually apprehended,

96
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,920
 which means apart from the Holy Spirit

97
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,920
 doing something tonight, this is a big waste of our time.

98
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,160
 And God, we're gonna hear words spoken and read

99
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,320
 and preached, but if your spirit doesn't allow us

100
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,960
 to apprehend these things, we're gonna have a stubbornness

101
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,040
 in our heart and a blindness and a hardness.

102
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,280
 We don't want that.

103
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,520
 We don't want that.

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,760
 So we are appealing to you, the kind one,

105
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,920
 to give us grace as we understand,

106
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,520
 seek to understand your word.

107
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,200
 Would your spirit come alongside the truth

108
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,240
 and awaken hearts?

109
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
 Help us to believe, we pray.

110
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,040
 In Jesus' name, amen.

111
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,680
 Amen.

112
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,920
 Well, when I was in middle school,

113
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,380
 I was not what you would call an athletic individual.

114
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,160
 That was not what you would call me.

115
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,660
 There were words that you could call me.

116
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,660
 Rotund was a word.

117
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,680
 Non-fast, sweaty.

118
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,560
 These are all words that you could call me

119
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,280
 in middle school, but athletic was not one of them.

120
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,160
 So you can imagine PE was a little bit

121
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,060
 of a trouble spot for me.

122
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,640
 And one day, as I was in eighth grade,

123
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,760
 I showed up to PE and I found out

124
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,240
 that we were having a badminton tournament.

125
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,960
 Now, I don't know if you know anything about badminton,

126
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,800
 but you should know that slow reflexes

127
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,680
 and poor eye-hand coordination are not your friend

128
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,960
 when you're playing the game, okay?

129
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,280
 It's not gonna help you in this game.

130
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
 So our teacher starts pairing us up,

131
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,920
 and to add insult to injury, I was paired up last, classic.

132
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,360
 And the guy that I got paired with was a guy named Paul.

133
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,920
 Now, you don't know Paul.

134
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,920
 And to be fair, I was nothing to write home about.

135
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:41,120
 But compared to Paul, I was LeBron James.

136
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
 (audience laughing)

137
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,400
 And so there we were, the two last guys

138
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,440
 being paired up, me and Paul.

139
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,920
 This was not looking very good for us,

140
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,800
 and our first game starts, and we start playing

141
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,280
 this really bizarre game, by the way.

142
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,460
 This game, and game one finishes, and we win.

143
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,320
 Which is, yeah, I laughed too, 'cause I didn't think

144
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,640
 it was a thing that could happen.

145
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,040
 And I thought, okay, well, just downhill from here, I guess.

146
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,880
 And we move up in the bracket.

147
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,680
 Next game happens, and we win.

148
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,980
 Semi-finals.

149
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,680
 We win!

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,360
 And I look at Paul at some point,

151
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,440
 and we just have this moment where we're like,

152
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,840
 we're losers.

153
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,820
 But this could happen, right?

154
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,660
 This thing could happen.

155
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,960
 And so somehow, somehow, by God's providence,

156
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,760
 we find ourselves in the finals, and it is on, man.

157
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,600
 Paul's swinging left, I'm dodging right,

158
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,920
 birdies are flying, we're like two chunky

159
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,120
 Andre Agassiz going at it.

160
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,120
 And somehow, we pull it off, and we sweep the whole thing.

161
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,560
 We win the whole thing.

162
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,040
 To this day, it is my crowning athletic achievement.

163
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,460
 That's it, it doesn't get, yes, yes, thank you for that.

164
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,440
 What happened?

165
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
 How was that possible?

166
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,880
 Like, that shouldn't be how it went down, right?

167
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,000
 It wasn't like we were bringing something

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,160
 really valuable to the table, you know what I mean?

169
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,180
 Like, we weren't great.

170
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,180
 The other teams knew it, and I think that actually

171
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,720
 played to our favor because they let their guard down.

172
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,920
 Me and Paul knew it, and that actually kind of loosened us

173
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,680
 up a bit 'cause we knew we had nothing to lose, right?

174
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,000
 We had everything to gain.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,040
 And this interesting cocktail of our mutual suckiness

176
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,600
 worked together in order for us to actually

177
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,560
 sweep the thing.

178
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,800
 It worked to our advantage to be losers.

179
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,920
 It was amazing.

180
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,580
 The thing that we thought would make us fail, listen,

181
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,860
 was the very thing that helped us win.

182
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,560
 Now, why am I telling you that story?

183
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,420
 Well, this evening, we are immersing ourselves

184
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,240
 in a passage that has everything to do with prayer,

185
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,520
 and specifically, the kinds of prayer

186
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,900
 that God responds to, right?

187
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,480
 And I don't know what comes to your mind

188
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,000
 when you think about prayer.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,320
 When I say that word, how that strikes you,

190
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,360
 how that makes you feel, but I do know

191
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,200
 prayer can be a tricky thing for us, right?

192
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,200
 It can be hard and messy and clumsy.

193
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,440
 You know, maybe when you think about prayer,

194
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,320
 maybe you're just worn out, right?

195
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,140
 Because for you, even when I say that,

196
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,980
 something comes to your mind,

197
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,400
 something you've been pleading with God for,

198
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,520
 it's just not happening, right?

199
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,320
 And it's been kind of exhausting for you,

200
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,120
 and like, why isn't this getting off the ground?

201
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,240
 What more do I need to do to make this thing happen, right?

202
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,760
 Maybe that's you, so that you just feel frustration, right?

203
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,440
 Maybe for you, it's anxiety, like,

204
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
 what's the words that I say

205
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,740
 that turn the switch in God's heart?

206
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,160
 Like, I just don't know, do I go really regal

207
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,640
 and add some vowels in there, or do I like dial it back?

208
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
 Like, how do I make this thing work?

209
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,120
 You know, I don't know how it strikes you.

210
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,320
 Maybe for you, you're none of those.

211
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,920
 Maybe for you, that's kind of the last place you wanna be,

212
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,520
 the last thing you wanna be doing,

213
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,400
 because when you think about prayer,

214
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,280
 all that you feel is that backpack of shame and guilt on you

215
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,680
 from your life, and actually coming into the presence of God

216
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,420
 it just feels like impossible.

217
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,280
 What am I gonna do?

218
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,040
 I'm gonna come into God's presence knowing what I did?

219
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,800
 I just feel, if you knew what I did,

220
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,520
 so how could I come to him?

221
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,280
 There's just shame and guilt around that whole thing.

222
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,560
 So maybe for you, it's like,

223
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,860
 my job is really not to pray, but to get my act together

224
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,640
 so that I can finally pray and talk to him.

225
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,560
 I know I felt that a lot over my life.

226
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,960
 Well, I don't know where you are, but wherever you are,

227
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,020
 we're all asking kind of the same fundamental question,

228
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,860
 aren't we?

229
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,680
 And it's this question of like,

230
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,560
 what does it take to get God to respond?

231
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
 I mean, what does it take for this interaction

232
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,300
 to be meaningful?

233
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,800
 Like, what moves the needle in my prayer life?

234
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,560
 What can give me that competitive edge, so to speak?

235
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,040
 Well, Jesus is answering that question tonight.

236
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,560
 He's about to show us that the advantage

237
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,160
 that we are looking for is found in unlikely place,

238
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,560
 that it is found in your weakness.

239
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,480
 That it's found in your weakness,

240
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,240
 that when it comes to prayer, weakness is the way.

241
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,760
 That's actually the main point tonight.

242
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
 Hold onto that, weakness is the way,

243
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,540
 that just like with me and my buddy Paul,

244
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,640
 it's precisely the fact that we have nothing to lose

245
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,360
 and everything to gain that actually gives us

246
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,040
 that advantage in prayer that causes his ear

247
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,720
 to bend low to us and his heart to soften toward us.

248
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,000
 Weakness is the way.

249
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,920
 And he's gonna show us this by giving us

250
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,920
 three very unexpected role models for prayer.

251
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,200
 We're gonna sort of peer through three different windows

252
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,200
 and see what comprises a person who gets the attention of

253
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,920
 and the intimacy of God.

254
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,840
 That's what we're doing here.

255
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,860
 So we have a lot to cover.

256
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,960
 Here's how it's gonna work.

257
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,840
 We're just gonna do an overview of these three scenes,

258
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,960
 peering into these three windows that Luke lays out for us.

259
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,720
 Then we're gonna back the camera off some,

260
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,680
 we're gonna draw a few conclusions and we'll be done.

261
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,880
 So that's where we're heading.

262
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,160
 So again, have that Bible out on your lap.

263
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,920
 We're in Luke 18 and we're gonna start back again

264
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,340
 at the top, verse one, scene one.

265
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,720
 And he told them a parable to the effect

266
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,700
 that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.

267
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,040
 Stop right there.

268
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,680
 So Luke is being really nice to us right now

269
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
 and he tells us up front what this parable means,

270
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,120
 which is a blessing to a guy like me

271
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,160
 'cause sometimes I come up on Jesus in the scriptures

272
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,360
 and I'm like, I don't know what those words mean together.

273
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,600
 And so it's nice when the author can go,

274
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,120
 "Hey, by the way, he means this, he's cutting me a break."

275
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,020
 So he tells us up front what it is and here's what it is.

276
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,960
 This parable was told, did you see it?

277
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,640
 So that we would always pray and not lose heart.

278
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,360
 You don't have to ask what the point of the parable is,

279
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,200
 there it is.

280
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,260
 So that we would always pray and not lose heart.

281
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,480
 Let's continue, verse two.

282
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,520
 He said in a certain city, there was a judge

283
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,960
 who neither feared God nor respected man.

284
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,360
 And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him

285
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,520
 and saying, "Give me justice against my adversary."

286
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,840
 For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself,

287
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,200
 "Though I neither fear God nor respect man,

288
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,020
 "yet because this widow keeps bothering me,

289
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,220
 "I will give her justice so that she will not beat me down

290
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,480
 "by her continual coming."

291
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,960
 And the Lord said, "Hear what the unrighteous judge says.

292
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,660
 "And will not God give justice to his elect

293
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,940
 "who cry out to him day and night?

294
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,780
 "Will he delay long over them?

295
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,420
 "I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily.

296
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,100
 "Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes,

297
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,720
 "will he find faith on the earth?"

298
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,760
 Okay, so stop there.

299
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,160
 This is the first of our three scenes,

300
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,880
 and it's a parable about prayer.

301
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,760
 We learn that God hears his people

302
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,400
 and is eager to do them good and bring justice for them.

303
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,640
 And that should drive us to our knees in prayer

304
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,760
 because we know we have a God who cares for us.

305
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,440
 Again, that is the point of this parable.

306
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,600
 That's the lay of the land.

307
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,480
 But now there's something else

308
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,680
 that I don't want us to miss

309
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,320
 'cause there's something happening beneath the surface here

310
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,720
 that we have to catch

311
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,420
 if we wanna get the full scope of this moment.

312
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,520
 What's beneath the surface?

313
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,200
 Well, think about this for a moment with me.

314
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,200
 Think about the casting of this parable.

315
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,080
 Who makes up the cast list right here?

316
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,720
 Well, it's a small cast, right?

317
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,360
 There's two characters.

318
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,280
 You have the judge

319
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,880
 who will be playing the role of God today, right?

320
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,240
 That's the judge not doing a hot job at it, right?

321
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,300
 And then you have the widow.

322
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,020
 And so who are we in the story?

323
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,720
 Well, if the judge is playing God, then who's playing us?

324
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,320
 Wait for it, here, oh, genius.

325
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,280
 The widow, right?

326
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,120
 It's the widow.

327
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
 It's obviously the widow.

328
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,120
 We are the widow in this story of Jesus's.

329
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,680
 Have you ever played that game with your friends?

330
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,600
 I'm like a cinephile, I love movies.

331
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,120
 Like I'm all about it.

332
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,120
 We play a game like where you go,

333
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,080
 hey, if you could cast any character

334
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,520
 as like my biopic character to play me,

335
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,180
 you know, who would that be?

336
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,520
 It's also called find out who your real friends are game.

337
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,760
 You ever played that game?

338
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,600
 No?

339
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,640
 I personally like to think of myself

340
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,300
 as like a slightly stronger Dwayne Johnson, okay?

341
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,280
 But do you know, and I'm not making this part up,

342
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,560
 do you know who my friends pick for me

343
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,360
 every time we play the game?

344
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,160
 All different groups of friends.

345
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,640
 It's like they've conspired.

346
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,820
 Jack Black.

347
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,760
 Jack Black.

348
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,680
 That is not a self-esteem booster.

349
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,120
 I don't know if you know that.

350
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,680
 This is a Jack Black moment for his disciples.

351
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,600
 That's what this is.

352
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,080
 Wait, you're casting me as the widow?

353
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,160
 I'm the, we're the widow in this story?

354
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,720
 Widow doesn't have the same stigma today as it did them,

355
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,280
 but just get a sense of this.

356
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,640
 In their day, a widow was powerless.

357
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,480
 You hear me?

358
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,300
 Powerless.

359
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,680
 She was without influence in the society.

360
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,340
 She was very susceptible to being taken advantage of.

361
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,320
 She was socially and financially vulnerable.

362
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,520
 Commentators even tell us that not even the land

363
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,440
 that she would have got from her husband

364
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,960
 was guaranteed after he died

365
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,040
 because that land was connected to his family of origin,

366
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
 not his family of marriage.

367
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,640
 And that made her incredibly dependent

368
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,800
 on the kindness and generosity of others.

369
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,720
 So she has to plead for the judge.

370
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,440
 She has to beg to him.

371
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,800
 He is her only hope for justice.

372
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,640
 Do you see that?

373
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,520
 Do you feel that now?

374
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,120
 And Jesus is saying, yeah, be like that.

375
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,560
 Do you feel that a little bit more?

376
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,360
 Does that strike you now?

377
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,200
 You're starting to see the point.

378
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,520
 Apart from, listen, apart from being tethered

379
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,520
 to the God of the universe, we have nothing.

380
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,360
 We are nothing.

381
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,540
 We bring nothing to the table.

382
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,960
 So if we want justice as God's people,

383
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,440
 we can't muster it ourselves.

384
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,080
 We're powerless until we look to him in prayer.

385
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,920
 Do you see that?

386
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,800
 Jesus is saying something profound.

387
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,760
 This is what he's saying.

388
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,240
 If you want your needs met,

389
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,180
 you have to see yourself as needy.

390
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:13,080
 If you want your needs met, right, you want that,

391
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,960
 then you have to concede, I'm needy.

392
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,920
 And man, that's a sideways pill to swallow, isn't it?

393
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,980
 That's just hard.

394
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,520
 It's like easy to talk about what we want,

395
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,440
 but it's hard to say, and I'm needy and I'm desperate,

396
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,000
 and you're my only hope.

397
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,140
 Weakness is the way.

398
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,600
 Anyone bummed yet?

399
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,720
 He's not done.

400
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,040
 Parable two coming at you.

401
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,600
 Verse nine, he also told this parable

402
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,880
 to some who trusted in themselves,

403
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,120
 that they were righteous and treated others with contempt.

404
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,520
 Again, thank you, Luke.

405
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,800
 Jesus told us this parable to do what?

406
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,880
 To rebuke self-righteous people who look down on others.

407
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,480
 Let's continue, verse 10.

408
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,480
 Two men went up into the temple to pray,

409
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,600
 one a Pharisee, the other a tax collector.

410
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,080
 The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus.

411
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,760
 God, I thank you that I'm not like other men,

412
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,200
 extortioners, unjust, adulterers,

413
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,240
 or even like this tax collector.

414
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,960
 I fast twice a week.

415
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,600
 I give tithes of all that I get,

416
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,080
 but the tax collector, standing far off,

417
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,760
 would not even lift up his eyes to heaven,

418
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,160
 but beat his breast, saying,

419
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,960
 God, be merciful to me, a sinner.

420
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,680
 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified,

421
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,040
 rather than the other.

422
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,720
 For anyone who exalts himself will be humbled,

423
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,120
 but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.

424
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,080
 So again, we're looking at a case

425
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,200
 of someone who is helped by God

426
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,240
 as they acknowledge their weakness and their need.

427
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,120
 Are you starting to see a theme develop here

428
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,160
 over this passage?

429
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,880
 But now, who is our cast this time?

430
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,640
 Again, a small ensemble.

431
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,400
 We got two characters again.

432
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,000
 You have the Pharisee and the tax collector.

433
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,120
 Let's talk about them.

434
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,360
 Let's deal with the Pharisee first.

435
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,720
 Now, this is a tricky bit, right?

436
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,520
 Because I understand that when I'm bringing up

437
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,600
 the word Pharisee to a group of modern,

438
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,400
 sort of evangelical Christians,

439
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,440
 do you ever, when I say that word Pharisee,

440
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,080
 do you generally have a positive feeling

441
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,840
 or a negative feeling?

442
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,840
 Negative, it strikes you as negative, right?

443
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,160
 Which means we're totally disconnected

444
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,280
 from how this would have struck his listeners,

445
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,080
 because it would not have struck them this way.

446
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,880
 A Pharisee was not a slur back then.

447
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,200
 This was their pastor.

448
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,040
 You feel me?

449
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,200
 These were their heroes.

450
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,840
 These were the men that you would aspire to be

451
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,200
 if you lived back then and were a Jew.

452
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,440
 They were godly.

453
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
 They were obedient.

454
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,560
 They obeyed the Torah.

455
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,000
 They strived to keep the law.

456
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,040
 That's how they were perceived in their culture.

457
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,760
 It doesn't hit us that way, but it hits them that way.

458
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,000
 This was the hero in the story.

459
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,920
 Do you feel me?

460
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,040
 He was the hero when they were hearing this

461
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,960
 for the first time.

462
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,920
 So that's the first character, the Pharisee.

463
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,680
 Second one, the tax collector.

464
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,000
 Now, again, we got a lot of distance here.

465
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,960
 Like tax collector doesn't have the same,

466
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,140
 it doesn't hit us, right?

467
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,760
 But in Palestine, in these days,

468
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
 the tax collector would have been despised.

469
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,320
 Why?

470
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,600
 They were Jewish citizens who were employed

471
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,440
 by that insurgent Roman government

472
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,080
 to take money from their own people

473
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,080
 and give it to the people that all their people hated.

474
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,920
 Right?

475
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,460
 It's a little awkward when you do that.

476
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,200
 Now, they didn't just do that.

477
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,800
 That would have been bad enough, right?

478
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,960
 But what's worse is they were notorious

479
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,600
 for then taking more from their people than they needed

480
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,080
 and not giving everything to Caesar

481
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,620
 and keeping some for themselves

482
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,000
 and lining their pockets with it.

483
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,900
 So these guys were hated by the Jews, right?

484
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,820
 They were seen as traitors and thieves and sellouts

485
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,120
 and completely morally bankrupt.

486
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,240
 Are you getting that picture?

487
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,360
 That's who these guys were.

488
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,260
 And Jesus finishes his parable and he says,

489
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,240
 this is the guy that they justified.

490
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,240
 This is the guy that God sent home righteous.

491
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,680
 This guy.

492
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,820
 What would that have felt like to hear?

493
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,800
 Right?

494
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,480
 It's again, it's just the sting of it.

495
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,640
 The stinger is missing a little bit in 2019.

496
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,040
 You know, we don't, like, I don't wanna get audited, right?

497
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,160
 But I don't wanna like plan the murder

498
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,800
 of the guy who's doing my tax audit, you know?

499
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,800
 But in this context, man, there was so much animosity there.

500
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,520
 So we need to feel the stigma more.

501
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,080
 We need to feel the uncomfortableness more.

502
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,240
 Let me try one out on you real quick and see if this fits.

503
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,320
 1992, a man by the name of Jeffrey Dahmer

504
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,320
 is given 15 life sentences for the brutal murder

505
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,040
 of 15 men and teenage boys,

506
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,160
 most of whom he raped and ate.

507
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:19,320
 Now, in prison, the cannibal, Jeffrey Dahmer

508
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,560
 was handed some Christian literature,

509
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,000
 a pamphlet, a gospel track.

510
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
 And he starts reading this in his cell.

511
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,240
 And as he's reading, the Holy Spirit explodes his heart

512
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,680
 with conviction over his sin.

513
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,880
 He starts to realize the monster that he is.

514
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 And in prison, in his cell, Jeffrey Dahmer bows the knee

515
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,440
 to Jesus Christ and the cannibal becomes a Christian,

516
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,560
 redeemed, justified.

517
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,420
 Now, how does that feel to hear that?

518
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,640
 To know that if you're in Christ,

519
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,440
 that when you die, you will be kicking it in heaven

520
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,560
 with a cannibal.

521
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,800
 It feels a little uncomfortable, doesn't it?

522
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,820
 God doesn't respond like that to cannibals, right?

523
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,160
 Like maybe like overeating food,

524
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,940
 but not humans.

525
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,500
 We don't, he doesn't act like that toward cannibals, right?

526
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,740
 He's not, he doesn't bend his ear toward them.

527
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,740
 But do you see now, that's the point of the passage.

528
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,260
 God does do that for cannibals.

529
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,300
 He does do that for tax collectors and liars

530
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,340
 and people who look at pornography and addicts

531
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,360
 and drunkards and every other vice you can imagine.

532
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,280
 That's what he does.

533
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,320
 The point of this is that when we come needy,

534
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,560
 he responds no matter who we are.

535
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,520
 That's the point, do you see that?

536
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,980
 The problem is, most of us, if we're just being real,

537
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,060
 most of us don't see ourselves that way.

538
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,200
 We can even kind of get down with that,

539
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,560
 the abstract idea of God being a merciful God like that,

540
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,600
 but we don't see ourselves as being needy.

541
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,360
 We tend to be a lot more like the Pharisee in this story,

542
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,520
 right, looking at our own record to justify us.

543
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,600
 That's what's happening here.

544
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,560
 But Jesus shows us that what we need

545
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,340
 is not to act like we have it all together,

546
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,280
 but rather to admit we are morally bankrupt

547
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,820
 to finally own it.

548
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,180
 That's what he's inviting us to.

549
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,180
 I remember it was, I think it was 10 years ago now.

550
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,260
 I was at a gas station with my wife.

551
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,580
 We were filling up the car, and the card wouldn't work.

552
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,060
 A little debit card, Wells Fargo thing, it wouldn't work.

553
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,320
 No gas for Jimmy.

554
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,140
 And I was like, okay, so we do the app thing,

555
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,180
 see, maybe like we run low or something,

556
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,300
 and my Wells Fargo account tells me

557
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,300
 that I have negative $2 million.

558
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 (audience laughing)

559
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,260
 I was like, Kelly, what'd you buy?

560
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,260
 (audience laughing)

561
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,540
 It was ridiculous.

562
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,900
 Now, there was a glitch in the system, right,

563
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,400
 and it accidentally debited,

564
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,060
 so they gave me back my $2 million, thank you.

565
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,780
 I hate when they take my $2 million from me.

566
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,500
 But they gave it back.

567
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,060
 But what's the point?

568
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,860
 What did I feel in that moment

569
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,940
 when I saw that number?

570
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,780
 What did I feel?

571
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,380
 Immediate despair, right?

572
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,740
 (audience laughing)

573
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,660
 This is it, babe.

574
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,000
 We had a good run.

575
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,620
 (audience laughing)

576
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,260
 Yeah, I'll see you later, right?

577
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,060
 Need?

578
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,780
 Oh, no, right?

579
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,620
 Those feelings crept up in me fast,

580
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,620
 and that's exactly what God is saying

581
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,620
 is the posture of someone who he responds to and justifies.

582
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,620
 Feel that.

583
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,200
 That's the posture.

584
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,140
 And some of you guys,

585
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,300
 you are bankrupt spiritually,

586
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,180
 but you are acting like a millionaire

587
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:32,580
 as if sort of putting on airs will impress God.

588
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,580
 Listen, it doesn't impress him.

589
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,760
 Need does, though.

590
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,660
 Need.

591
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,220
 Repent of that.

592
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,860
 Come to him desperate for forgiveness

593
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,560
 and watch him give it 'cause he loves to.

594
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,920
 We starting to see the theme?

595
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,460
 God's ear is bent toward the needy widow

596
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,500
 and his heart is forgiving to the sinful tax collector

597
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,300
 and as if to drive his point home one more time,

598
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,220
 Luke gives us one more story.

599
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,180
 We're gonna look at it together.

600
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,220
 Verse 15 says this.

601
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,200
 Now they were bringing even infants to him

602
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,180
 that he might touch them.

603
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,940
 And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them,

604
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,580
 but Jesus called them to him saying,

605
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,540
 "Let the children come to me and do not hinder them

606
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,720
 for to such belongs the kingdom of God.

607
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,620
 Truly I say to you,

608
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,220
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child

609
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,620
 shall not enter it."

610
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,620
 Again, I just want you to feel this.

611
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,420
 This is another one of those moments

612
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,860
 where there's a disconnect here.

613
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,900
 See, in ancient Jewish culture,

614
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,260
 children were not little bitty bundles of chunky joy, right?

615
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,900
 They were not, you didn't bounce them on your lap

616
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,420
 and pass them around.

617
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,340
 That's not what you did with a child.

618
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,420
 They weren't little bundles of joy.

619
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,520
 They were inconveniences then.

620
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,980
 Not because they were hated by people,

621
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,460
 but because in Jewish culture,

622
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,820
 there was a high, high value placed on contribution.

623
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,660
 What can you contribute to the family's good?

624
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,220
 If you can't contribute to the family's good yet,

625
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,420
 then you're of low value to us until you can.

626
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,000
 And so when they saw children back then,

627
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
 that was the sense that they got.

628
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,580
 It wasn't an endearing thing.

629
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,660
 And for Jesus, somebody of Jesus's stature

630
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:34,660
 and notoriety to come around and to bless these infants

631
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,460
 was beneath the teacher of his stature.

632
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,300
 Do you see that?

633
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,200
 It would have been a really surprising

634
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,300
 and even offensive sight for his disciples to see this.

635
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,780
 That's why they rebuked those kids and those parents.

636
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,780
 And yet here he is, Jesus, holding and blessing infants,

637
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,420
 non-contributors, the vulnerable.

638
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,820
 And one more time, we're faced with that question, aren't we?

639
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,020
 How do we see ourselves?

640
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,260
 That's what his disciples were faced with in this moment.

641
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,020
 That's what Jesus is doing in this moment.

642
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,020
 Do you see yourself, be honest, when you think about you,

643
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,580
 do you see yourself as strong,

644
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:21,860
 self-sustaining, important, substantial?

645
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,020
 Or is the first thought that you have

646
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:31,020
 when you think about you, needy, dependent, trusting,

647
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,060
 vulnerable, without help?

648
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,940
 Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive

649
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,580
 the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.

650
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,020
 Let that sober you tonight.

651
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,820
 You feeling challenged?

652
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,220
 These are our three scenes.

653
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,500
 These are our three role models.

654
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,500
 And this leaves us with some questions to answer.

655
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,620
 Like, what does a vulnerable widdle,

656
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,580
 a moral degenerate, and a societal nuisance

657
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,980
 teach us about prayer?

658
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,740
 'Cause that's what this passage is.

659
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,500
 What do they teach us about prayer?

660
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,880
 Three ending observations.

661
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,580
 What does this mean for us?

662
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,580
 Number one, your self-reliance will kill you.

663
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:39,380
 Your self-reliance will kill you.

664
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:47,660
 There's a lot of encouragement to be had in this passage,

665
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,260
 but this passage is also a warning tonight.

666
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:57,100
 At the very center of Christianity is a concession

667
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,020
 that I lack what I need to be right with God.

668
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,740
 That's at the heart of this thing.

669
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:12,300
 That I lack the power to change things in me.

670
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,460
 That I lack the power to change things around me.

671
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,460
 So to act like you're strong or able or righteous

672
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,980
 or put together in and of yourself

673
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,980
 is not only anti-prayerful, it is anti-Christian.

674
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:40,700
 The Pharisee was a better man than the tax collector.

675
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,220
 Do you hear me?

676
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,460
 No one would have disagreed with this.

677
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,100
 He wasn't stealing from anybody.

678
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,100
 He was keeping the Torah as he knew how.

679
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,900
 He wasn't committing adultery or cheating

680
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,180
 or doing these types of things.

681
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,580
 He wasn't thieving.

682
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:08,580
 He was being good, and he went to hell.

683
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,020
 We don't say that in 2019 though, right?

684
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,900
 We don't talk like that in 2019,

685
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,620
 'cause it's just not, it's better left unsaid, isn't it?

686
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,620
 But do you see that's the point?

687
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,180
 The good guy loses in that story.

688
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,340
 And the bad guy, the degenerate,

689
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,940
 the one who owned his need and could come to God

690
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,620
 with all of his bankruptcy, he's the one God justified.

691
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,300
 The cannibal.

692
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:53,140
 You having it all figured out before you come to God,

693
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,180
 guys, girls, it's working against you.

694
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,940
 It's working against you.

695
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,780
 Your efforts to be put together and morally pristine

696
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,660
 so that God will accept you,

697
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,060
 those things are working against you tonight.

698
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,620
 It's not good for you.

699
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,780
 Some of you tonight, you're hearing this,

700
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,780
 and what you need to do is lay down your trust in you

701
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,860
 and cast yourself on the mercy of Jesus tonight.

702
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,900
 That's what you need to do.

703
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,580
 Warts and all.

704
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,340
 The whole package.

705
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,540
 You will not gain access to him

706
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,860
 or find answers to your prayers

707
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,740
 in your prideful self-reliance.

708
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,980
 Our self-reliance will kill us.

709
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,580
 Number two.

710
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:59,940
 Weakness shows off God's strength.

711
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,380
 It's what it does.

712
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,380
 Weakness shows off God's strength.

713
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,460
 I said earlier that God is attracted to those

714
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,460
 who have nothing to contribute.

715
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,420
 Why?

716
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,260
 Why is that?

717
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,980
 Why is he inclined to those people

718
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,540
 over the people who think they have something to contribute?

719
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,380
 Why is that?

720
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,220
 Here's why.

721
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:24,220
 Because when I contribute nothing to God except my need,

722
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,860
 then God must contribute everything else.

723
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,300
 And when God contributes everything else,

724
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,380
 who is the one that in the end I get to brag on

725
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,020
 as having done something good?

726
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,940
 Who is the one at the end that I can point at

727
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,180
 and celebrate and say, "That's praiseworthy"?

728
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,300
 I'm not allowed to point at me anymore.

729
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,300
 If he made the contribution, I can only point at him.

730
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,020
 This is Christianity.

731
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,340
 If you're wondering what this whole thing was,

732
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,700
 maybe you're here for one of the first times,

733
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,620
 you're just trying to sort out

734
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,740
 what this Christian thing is, this is it.

735
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,500
 This is the gospel.

736
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,660
 You and I rebelled against God.

737
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,140
 Our first parents did it,

738
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,980
 and we learned a good lesson from them.

739
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,420
 We keep on doing it, don't we?

740
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,780
 We stiff on him at every turn.

741
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,660
 And God in his mercy, instead of leaving us, he pursued us.

742
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,860
 He condescended to come get us in the person of Jesus.

743
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,260
 Jesus lived the perfect life.

744
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,940
 You and I could never do in our place.

745
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,900
 He made the contribution.

746
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,780
 He hung up on a Roman cross

747
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,900
 and bled out for six hours in our place.

748
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,900
 His contribution, not ours, rose from the grave,

749
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,420
 defeated death, conquered all our enemies in our place.

750
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,780
 His contribution.

751
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,900
 In the end, every Christian will never be able

752
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,980
 to point at themselves.

753
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,420
 If you're truly in Christ, the best we can do,

754
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,700
 the greatest thing we can do is only point at the one

755
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,580
 who made the contribution, and that's Jesus every time.

756
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,740
 That is the gospel.

757
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,780
 We're needy, he is the need meter.

758
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,300
 Do you see that?

759
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,180
 And praise God for that.

760
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:05,180
 And if that's true, if he's the strong one when I'm weak,

761
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,220
 if he's the powerful one when I'm not powerful,

762
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,020
 if he's the contributor when my basket's empty

763
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,780
 and I have nothing to give to him, if that's true,

764
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,800
 then this last point is true.

765
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,060
 When things feel the most hopeless,

766
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,260
 that's when there's the most hope.

767
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,140
 That's when there's the most hope.

768
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,140
 If what we've just seen from Luke is true,

769
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,980
 our optimism, listen, your optimism in your prayer life

770
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,620
 should be exploding if you feel like you're not bringing

771
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,820
 much to the table.

772
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,820
 It should be exploding and bursting out because you can't,

773
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,340
 but you serve the God who can.

774
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,380
 That's who we serve, and that gives us such a confidence.

775
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,180
 When things are the most hopeless,

776
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,380
 that's when there's the most hope.

777
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,020
 Are you crippled by your sin tonight?

778
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,740
 Man, you just came in and you're just wrecked, right?

779
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,340
 And you know, like, this week,

780
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,300
 like maybe the Holy Spirit's actually been poking

781
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,380
 at your conscience and maybe it's for the first time,

782
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,540
 and you're just like, I'm just, I'm a mess.

783
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,980
 What am I even doing in this room?

784
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,860
 Addiction has you by the throat.

785
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,860
 You can't get out of it, right?

786
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,260
 You keep on stumbling.

787
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,660
 Is there any hope for me?

788
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,460
 Yes, pray.

789
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,320
 Pray, pray to the one who loves bringing triumph

790
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,580
 out of failure.

791
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,940
 That's what we do when we feel bankrupt morally.

792
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,740
 We come to him and we pray.

793
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,220
 Do you feel like our, when you look around,

794
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,660
 that like our culture is just like falling apart?

795
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,340
 Like what, where am I living anymore?

796
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,820
 What a tragedy this is.

797
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,060
 Is your heart breaking as you're hearing reports

798
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:52,060
 of 3,000 babies a day being murdered legally in our country?

799
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,240
 Does that break your heart and you want to see change?

800
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,620
 Or just the ridiculous amounts of still in 2019,

801
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:05,260
 racial tension, like the almost total absence of diversity

802
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,540
 in the church in America, like, does that break your heart?

803
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,200
 Do you want to see change?

804
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,140
 Pray, plead to the God who just told us,

805
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,260
 I give justice to my elect, I make these things happen.

806
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,700
 Are you a person who's just trying to hustle

807
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
 and make it happen yourself?

808
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,780
 You got all these plans, but you're not hitting your knees.

809
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,420
 You're not doing what the text says.

810
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,300
 The text says, come to him.

811
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,420
 The text says, plead with the judge

812
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,180
 and he'll bring that justice.

813
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,140
 He loves doing that.

814
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,120
 Pray to him.

815
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,180
 If you have broken relationships in your life

816
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,740
 and you're wanting to see healing there, pray to him.

817
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,300
 Are you desperate to see your friends saved,

818
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,820
 your parents saved, your siblings saved,

819
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,340
 the folks at your work come to know Jesus?

820
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,420
 The literally billions of people

821
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,460
 who've never heard the name of Jesus

822
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,340
 at one time in the whole world,

823
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,540
 you want to see them come to know Jesus?

824
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,900
 You know, the first thing you need to do

825
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,140
 is fall on your knees and plead to God.

826
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,140
 If this is telling us anything,

827
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,540
 it's that when it feels so insurmountable,

828
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,940
 and it feels like there's no, how could this,

829
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,500
 how could we ever move the needle?

830
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,780
 That's the best time to plead with him

831
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,960
 because it's gonna make God look great

832
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
 when he starts answering those prayers.

833
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,460
 When he comes through, he looks great

834
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,740
 and he wants to look great on your behalf.

835
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,180
 Pray and plead with him.

836
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,840
 Come weak, come lowly,

837
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,380
 but come, like tonight, come, pray.

838
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,940
 This is an opportunity for you.

839
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,380
 You're not here on accident.

840
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,580
 You're here to hear this word

841
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,180
 and respond by crying out to God

842
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,100
 who's eager to show off his strength for you.

843
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,780
 I am the God, Jeremiah says, I am the God of all flesh.

844
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
 Is anything too difficult for me?

845
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,020
 No, it is for you.

846
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,540
 It's not for him.

847
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,380
 Plead with him.

848
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,180
 We do what that song says.

849
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,440
 Nothing in my hands I bring.

850
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,280
 Simply to thy cross I cling.

851
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,340
 Nothing, that's what you need tonight.

852
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,020
 Will you come with that?

853
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,780
 'Cause that's all you gotta come with.

854
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,680
 Come with nothing.

855
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,640
 Let's pray to him now.

856
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:43,460
 Just give you a minute for the Lord

857
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,700
 to work these truths into your heart.

858
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,600
 And then just ask him if maybe you've got some walls

859
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,520
 going up and you just ask him,

860
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,960
 God, would you be kind to me, tear down these walls,

861
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,000
 help me be soft tonight and receive these things.

862
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:07,200
 If your heart's been hard and you're struggling

863
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,760
 and sin and failure and you've kind of realized it tonight

864
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,220
 and you're like, man, I just,

865
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,760
 I need change, but I can't.

866
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,380
 I just never been able to and I still can't.

867
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,060
 Praise God for Jesus tonight.

868
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,640
 Like literally praise him.

869
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,280
 Thank him for him.

870
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,640
 Ask him to send his spirit to work in you

871
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,580
 and help you, free you.

872
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,900
 Cast yourself on Christ tonight.

873
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,440
 God, we,

874
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,480
 we have nothing and are nothing without you,

875
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,140
 but we look to you, the strong one.

876
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,120
 Will you show off tonight in human hearts

877
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,080
 so that your fame and your renown

878
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,080
 would be made much of tonight and forever.

879
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,880
 In Jesus' good name, amen.
