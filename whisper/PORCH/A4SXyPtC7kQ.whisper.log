[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   (eerie music)
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:15.440]   Are you scared?
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.360]   You should be.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.580]   Hey, can I just say, I just want you to know,
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.060]   and wherever you're listening from,
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.920]   whether you're here in Dallas or at another campus,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.000]   what a privilege it is.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.720]   As I was singing and worshiping
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.500]   and just sitting here with you,
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.160]   just thinking, man, what a privilege
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.880]   that so many young adults would give their life
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.800]   to worshiping God.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.160]   And I know some of you are visitors and guests,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.560]   and you may not know this God
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.020]   that we're singing to and talking to,
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.380]   but I just, I want you to know
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.220]   that I consider it a great privilege
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.720]   to get to open the word with you this evening.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.440]   How many of you are here for the very first time?
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.480]   Like, it's okay, no big deal,
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.840]   I'm not gonna make you stand up and sing or anything.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.880]   Okay, that's a lot, a lot of you
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.380]   is here for the very first time.
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.160]   Yeah, that's awesome, man, praise God.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.400]   Welcome.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.760]   Hey, welcome home, welcome to our home, I mean that.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.920]   I pray you'd make it your home,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.060]   and we're so glad you're with us.
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.520]   Usually when you visit a church,
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.800]   you know, they talk of one of two things.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.560]   It's either money or hell, right?
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.920]   They're talking about one of those things,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.160]   and we're not talking about money, so let's go.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.180]   I wanna start with just a story that happened to me
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.880]   when my oldest daughter was two and a half years old,
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.280]   and she was kinda going through that terrible two phase
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.700]   that I'm sure you guys have heard about,
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.080]   and so she's about two and a half, she's a good kid,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.320]   but going through a rough phase,
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.680]   and I had had a rough day, you know,
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.420]   and so really busy, back-to-back meetings,
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.760]   and then my truck broke down,
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.160]   kind of right in the middle of that,
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.600]   and so, you know, I took,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.320]   there's never a good time for your car to break down,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.120]   so I take my truck to the mechanic,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.560]   and I'm sitting there in the waiting room,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.880]   and they finished doing whatever they needed to do,
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.960]   so I was gonna be back on the road.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.800]   That was good news,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.440]   the only good news this particular day,
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.640]   and as I go to pay the bill,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.960]   there's a bowl of lollipops right there,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.300]   and so this is what's true
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.180]   about my two and a half year old at the time.
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.700]   Nobody has ever loved anything
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700]   as much as she loves lollipops.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.180]   I mean, it's weird, this weird obsession,
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.800]   and so you could think about something that you love,
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.420]   think about whether you have it, or you really want it,
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.180]   but she just has this crazy, strange obsession
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.900]   for lollipops at this time in her life,
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.620]   and so I see that bowl, and just like any good dad would do,
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.180]   you know, I grabbed one for her,
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.640]   and I took that, and I put it in my coat pocket
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.900]   on this particular day,
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.180]   and then I'm on my way home,
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.780]   and so I called Monica, my wife, on the way home,
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.980]   and she kind of answers the phone,
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.260]   and my wife's usually cheerful and full of joy,
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.460]   and she's kind of, "Hello," you know,
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.740]   "I could tell something was wrong."
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.580]   I'm like, "What's wrong?"
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.380]   She's like, "Oh, Presley just had a rough day today,"
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.860]   and I'm like, "Well, what do you mean?"
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.260]   Presley's my daughter, two and a half.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.100]   "Well, what do you mean?"
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.580]   And she's like, "Well, she just wasn't kind to her sister,
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.320]   "and she made some bad choices,
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.780]   "and then she was disrespectful,"
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.900]   and we kind of have this rule in our home.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.740]   If you get in trouble with mommy multiple times,
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.540]   then you get in trouble with daddy
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.860]   when he gets home, and so I'm thinking,
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.540]   "Hey, after this long, rough day,
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.140]   "the first thing I'm gonna have to do
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.740]   "when I get home is discipline my daughter,"
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.100]   which is unfortunate, right?
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.700]   And so I keep going on the way home,
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.900]   and I get there, and I walk in,
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.960]   and I sit Presley down, and I just say,
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.540]   "Hey, you know, what's going on?
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.180]   "What did you do today?"
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.540]   And she said, "Daddy, I had a rough day."
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.960]   And I, two and a half, and I said,
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.480]   "Man, it's hard to be two and a half," you know?
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.800]   And I just said, "Well, what did you do?"
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.240]   She said, "I made some poor choices today."
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.160]   And I said, "Oh, I hate to hear that."
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.000]   I said, "Well, what did you do?"
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.840]   And she said, "You know, I was disrespectful to mommy,
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.320]   "and I talked back, and I was mean to Finley,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.840]   "and I did," she begins to list out those things.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.820]   I said, "Man, that's such a bummer, man," you know?
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.720]   And I said, "'Cause look, you know, I saw this today,"
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600]   and I pulled that out, and her eyes got this big.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.760]   (laughing)
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.720]   And she's like, "Daddy, Daddy, is that for me?"
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.240]   I was like, "Oh, I got it for you."
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.960]   She's like, "Daddy, can I have it?
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.680]   "Can I have it, can I have it?"
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.880]   I said, "No," I said, "You can't have it.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.040]   "See, I got this for you, but I can't give it to you.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.800]   "I can't come home and reward you for your behavior,
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.160]   "and so I'm afraid you're not gonna get that."
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.000]   And she looks at me and she goes,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.240]   (growling)
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.760]   "I can do whatever I want!"
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.000]   (laughing)
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:36.520]   Really?
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.240]   And I'm thinking, you know,
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.880]   I never learned how to do an exorcism.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.720]   I don't know.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.920]   (laughing)
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.040]   What just happened?
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.580]   What just happened?
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.580]   And I said, "You can,"
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.500]   and so let me just pause,
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.140]   'cause I've got some options now as a dad.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.180]   I've got some things, I've got like a quiver
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.380]   full of disciplinary actions I can take.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.540]   I'm like, is it spanking, is it hand, or is it spoon,
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.540]   or maybe we go belt for this one,
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.780]   or maybe, you know, you can sit in that chair,
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.980]   you know, for the rest of your life,
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.860]   or it's corner, or quiet time, timeout,
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.620]   or maybe you're grounded from prom.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.380]   I'm thinking, like, what am I gonna do?
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.140]   But let me, as I walk through the options,
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.340]   like, let me tell you what I didn't do.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.660]   Like, imagine if I would've been like,
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.600]   hey, come with me.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.020]   Let's go to the front door,
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.660]   and I open the door,
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.740]   and I put her on the other side of it,
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.340]   and I say, "Man, it's been really fun being your dad,
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.420]   "but this is the end."
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.820]   (laughing)
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.820]   Yeah, this is where it stops,
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.980]   and so you go that way, I'm gonna go this way,
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.580]   no hard feelings, and you know.
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.820]   Yeah, I wouldn't do that, right?
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.020]   'Cause like, some of you are like,
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.900]   how can you even say that, you know?
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.420]   And I was like, I would never do that.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.340]   I would never be like, hey, you wanna do that,
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.460]   then we're done, no more communication forever,
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.740]   'cause that wouldn't be a loving dad.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.740]   That wouldn't be, but isn't that what God does?
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.060]   Isn't that kind of the doctrine of hell?
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.160]   That because you've done something wrong here,
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.340]   that at some point when you die,
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.860]   he cuts you off forever, there's separation,
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.740]   no more communication, and not just that,
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.860]   but you probably heard some pretty horrific things,
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.660]   and lots of pain, and agony, and torment,
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.020]   and suffering, and fire, and all the things
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.420]   that we think of when we think of hell.
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.860]   And so I wanna be really honest with you tonight.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.980]   We're moving into a series called The Afterlife,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.180]   what happens to you when you die.
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.340]   And my concern for us is we don't really deal
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.780]   with the topic of death a lot.
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.400]   Like back in the day, someone would die
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.460]   right in the living room, they would die in the bedroom,
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.860]   they would die in the home, and you would handle the body,
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.740]   and you would dig a hole in the back pasture,
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.980]   and you would bury them, and you would see it.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.740]   Most of us have never even been in the room
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.660]   when someone dies.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.900]   It's very peripheral to our life today.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.140]   It's very marginal from where we're at.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.460]   We've outsourced that to the medical industry
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.500]   here in America, so we don't think about death a lot.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.740]   Like a lot of you, maybe you're in your 20s,
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.300]   and hell or heaven feels like a really long ways off.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.020]   But can I tell you something?
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.100]   I had a friend die this week.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.120]   An untimely death, pneumonia.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.540]   Took a turn for the worse.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.780]   Nobody saw it coming.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.980]   You have no idea when you're going to die,
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.580]   and because you exist now,
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.940]   you will exist somewhere forever.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.180]   And we've got to deal with this doctrine,
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.420]   and I hate it, man, I hate it.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.740]   I wish we didn't have to.
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.740]   I mean, we all know, I hate that some of you
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.460]   listening to this right now will be in hell one day.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.740]   The weight of that is overwhelming to me.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.460]   And you have friends that will be there,
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.660]   we have family that will be there,
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.940]   and the weight of that, if we really grasped it,
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:10.400]   would be completely overwhelming and terrifying to us.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.240]   But we have to talk about it
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.600]   because the Bible talks about it.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.860]   And so as we start this series,
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.640]   we're gonna start with option one, and that is hell.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.360]   And I wanna teach you truth from the Scriptures.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.920]   Jesus talked more about hell
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.160]   than everyone else in the Bible combined.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.080]   More than half of his parables
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.640]   highlighted the doctrine of hell.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.080]   He talked a lot about this.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.160]   And so I do, as I said, I wish I could change this, right?
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.720]   And if you want to hear that it's not real
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.300]   and there's not a hell and you're not gonna go there,
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.560]   you don't have to go far.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.160]   People are constantly trying to erase this doctrine.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.000]   Rob Bell wrote a book called "Love Wins"
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.040]   that had a lot of traction and people listened to it
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.740]   because it was popular
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.420]   because there was some confusing ideas in it about hell.
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.160]   And then maybe you heard about the Pope's interview
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.840]   last week that made national news,
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.560]   that he said there is no hell.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.700]   Now, I don't know if he said it or not.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.400]   The Vatican issued a statement after the fact
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.700]   kind of recanting some of that.
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.400]   I don't know what happened there,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.560]   but I will tell you, if you want to find somebody
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.180]   who says there is no hell, you will not have to go far,
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.320]   but you will not hear that from Jesus.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.140]   When God was on the earth, he talked about hell a lot.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.660]   He wanted you to know about it.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.840]   And I think we have this obsession in some ways
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.800]   with the afterlife.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.240]   Like whether somebody spends 23 minutes in hell
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.800]   or Colton Burpo's writing "Heaven is for Real,"
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.600]   I want you to know that hell is for real
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.460]   too.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.800]   I think this is one of the reasons,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.240]   you know, that the movie right now,
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.100]   I can only imagine, by mercy me,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.120]   that song was so popular because it's talking about
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.500]   what happens in the afterlife.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.820]   We have an obsession about it.
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.760]   And tonight I want you to know what is real.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.620]   There's lots of different beliefs.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.960]   I'll go through some of them real quick.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.000]   There's the belief of naturalism,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.360]   which is the atheist worldview.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.540]   That is that you die, you go in the ground
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.180]   and worms eat you, you decay, and that's it.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.420]   You cease to exist.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.720]   There's annihilationism.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.080]   This is kind of what they said, the Pope said.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.040]   It's where you go to hell and then you essentially
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.620]   just burn off, you disappear.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.060]   There's universalism, which it says that everyone
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.400]   will eventually go to heaven.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.660]   Maybe you go to hell for a season,
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.120]   but you eventually go to heaven.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.320]   There's reincarnation.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.960]   If you're here and you are of the Hindu faith,
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.020]   you believe that you're going to die and then come back
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.240]   as either an animal, depending on how you lived,
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   or as a person, or maybe even someone of nobility.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.440]   There's the idea of the Catholic doctrine of purgatory,
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.780]   this middle ground, this place where you go
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.380]   until you are prayed out of it,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.480]   this place between heaven and hell,
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.020]   or someone pays your way out of there, purgatory.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.180]   And I can remember when young adults would say,
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.580]   "Hey, I don't want to worship God
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.860]   "because I don't want to worship anyone
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.360]   "who sends someone to hell."
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.860]   And I think the more common belief today is, who cares?
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.440]   It's apathy.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.160]   Eminem said, "There's a place called heaven
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.240]   "and a place called hell, a place called prison
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.400]   "and a place called jail, and Daddy's on his way
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.480]   "to all three of them except one."
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.200]   And I think that's really our posturing
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.040]   as we talk about this place, hell.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.040]   It's like, eh, maybe I'll go there, maybe I won't.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.640]   That's because we don't know what it is.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.920]   You would never have that posturing
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.080]   if you understood what it is.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.480]   I'm gonna be in Luke chapter 16, if you turn there.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.840]   I'm gonna start in verse 19 of Luke chapter 16,
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.160]   turn to the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.040]   Three books in.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.880]   We're gonna look at three questions about hell
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.560]   from this story that Jesus tells.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.040]   We're gonna look at what it is, who should be there,
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.420]   and what we do about it.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.240]   Jesus, he's teaching the Pharisees.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.800]   These are the religious people of the time.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.080]   He's like, "Hey, let me tell you about a story
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.200]   "about one of my favorite topics.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.680]   "We're gonna talk about hell."
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.040]   And so they're leaning in,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.640]   and this is what he says in verse 19.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.600]   There was a rich man who was dressed in purple
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.520]   and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.240]   What he just did is he put the Pharisees in the story.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.680]   These were the first, they were the originators
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.000]   of the prosperity gospel.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.240]   They believed that if you were rich,
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.220]   you had a unique relationship with God,
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.400]   that God must love you, that's why you're wealthy.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.580]   So this wealthy man who's dressed in purple,
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.560]   which was expensive clothes, okay,
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.400]   it's kinda like Prada, Gucci of the time, would be purple,
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.040]   and so that's what he's draped in,
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.440]   and he says he lives in a life of luxury every day.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.720]   At his gate now, there's another man, he's a beggar,
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.480]   his name is Lazarus.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.960]   He's covered in sores, and he's longing to eat
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.160]   what fell from this rich man's table,
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.000]   and even the dogs came and licked his sores.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.360]   Lazarus, the name is literally the one whom God helped,
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.120]   the one whom God helped, and he's poor,
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.480]   and he's covered in sores, and he's hungry,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.680]   and dogs come and lick his sores.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.680]   So two men, the time came when the beggar died,
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.680]   Lazarus dies, and the angels came
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.080]   and carried him to Abraham's side.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.520]   Okay, so Jesus is talking to Jews,
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.560]   and he wants to talk to them about heaven,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.360]   so he talks to them about where Abraham,
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.640]   Father Abraham, all the Jews would have known Abraham,
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.200]   and he's like, hey, so now this man Lazarus
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.880]   is there with Abraham, Abraham's side.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.100]   If you've studied theology,
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.240]   maybe you've heard it as Abraham's bosom.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.040]   It's the waiting place, it's heaven,
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.280]   it's a place with God, a place of contentment,
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.200]   a place of great joy, where we await for Jesus
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.800]   to come back here, to make the new heavens
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.040]   and the new earth here.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.960]   More about that next week.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:49.540]   The rich man also died and was buried.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.040]   In Hades, that's where he's at.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.840]   In Hades, where he was in torment,
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.000]   you can underline torment,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.360]   he looked up and saw Abraham far away,
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.680]   and Lazarus by his side.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.200]   So he called to him, Father Abraham,
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.820]   have pity on me and send Lazarus
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.120]   to dip the tip of his finger in water
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.600]   and cool my tongue, because I am in agony,
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.080]   underline that word, agony in this fire.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.640]   But Abraham replied, son, remember that in your lifetime
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.400]   you received your good things,
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.120]   while Lazarus received bad things,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.760]   but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.860]   And besides all this, between us and you,
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.320]   a great chasm has been set in place
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.560]   so that those who want to go from here to you cannot,
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.760]   nor can anyone cross over from there to us.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.880]   The rich man answered, then I beg you, Father,
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.420]   send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers,
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.760]   let him warn them so that they will not come
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.960]   to this place of torment.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.000]   Abraham replied, they have Moses and the prophets,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   let them listen to them.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.480]   No, Father Abraham, he said, but if someone
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.520]   from the dead goes to them, they will repent.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.800]   He said to them, Abraham says, if they do not listen
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.460]   to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced,
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.040]   even if someone rises from the dead.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.360]   He says, hey, they have the Old Testament,
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.800]   they have the Torah, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   Numbers, Deuteronomy, let them read from the prophets.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   They tell of where salvation can be found,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.680]   and if they're not gonna listen to the Bible,
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.360]   they're not gonna listen, even if someone raises
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.220]   from the dead.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.360]   And so you have two men here,
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:42.720]   two deaths, two destinations, Abraham's side,
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.260]   Hades, hell, Gehenna, the Valley of Hinnom,
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.880]   and we're talking about the afterlife.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.560]   You have a place of comfort and a place of torment,
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:00.420]   a place of punishment, and a place of peace and goodness.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.800]   We're gonna focus on the one of punishment this evening.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   The first question I wanna ask from this text
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.240]   is what is hell?
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.120]   What is hell?
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.640]   Let's talk about it, what it is.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.640]   Well, let me start by saying what it's not.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.840]   It's very simply, it's not anything remotely good.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.520]   It is void of anything good, joyful, blissful,
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.600]   pleasant, peaceful, nice, kind, good, gentle,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.600]   faithful, loving, anything that would cross over
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.320]   the positive line, it's not there.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.920]   But Abraham replied, verse 25,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.340]   "Son, remember in your life you received your good things.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.060]   "You got 'em here on this earth,
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.820]   "so now you will have no good things.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.240]   "While Lazarus received bad things,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.920]   "but now he is comforted, and you are in agony."
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.920]   And so while anyone who's not trusted in Christ on earth,
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:58.040]   they still, even though they do not have God's Holy Spirit,
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.360]   still get to experience something called common grace.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.380]   So there is no hell on earth.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.520]   Let me explain what common grace is.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.880]   There are things in this earth
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.840]   that are like commercials for God.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.080]   It's things that make you laugh,
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.040]   things that give you a feeling of peace and contentment,
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.520]   things that allow you to feel satisfied,
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.280]   simple things like satisfying your hunger
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.840]   or quenching your thirst, watching a sunset,
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.560]   being generally protected.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.680]   Okay, this is God's common grace to you.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.240]   And they're commercials for God that shows you,
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.760]   hey, you're being watched over and protected,
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.480]   that there's a creator who's looking over you.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.180]   There is none of those things in hell.
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.840]   There's nothing that remotely resembles that in hell.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.380]   There's nothing to numb your pain in hell.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.880]   So some of you think, yeah, you know,
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.000]   I'm gonna go to hell and party, drug, sex, and hip hop.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.640]   No, it's no, no, no.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.020]   None of those things exist in hell.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.880]   And so if you're ever like, yeah, man, you know,
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.880]   someone's gonna die, hey, take a shot of Patron with Satan
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.760]   in my honor, what this text is telling you
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   is there's nothing to even drink in hell.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.360]   He's like, hey, Lazarus, go get me a drink.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.960]   I'm in agony.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.000]   Oh, no shots of Patron.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.400]   There are none of your sinful pleasures in hell.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:36.020]   There's nothing that would bring you any relief.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.880]   There's no drugs there.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   It is a place void of God's blessing,
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.160]   void of joy, void of community, void of pleasure,
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.160]   void of good, and then here's the real kicker, forever.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.480]   Forever.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.760]   Forever.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.860]   It never goes away.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.840]   It's not punishment for a season and then cease.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.000]   It's forever.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   It's a place of torment and agony, verses 23, 24, and 25.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.960]   Torment and agony.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.040]   Jesus, when he'd talk about hell, he would use a metaphor.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.200]   It was a literal place called Gehenna
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.800]   or the Valley of Hinnom.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.400]   What it was was essentially the dump.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.280]   It was a place outside the city where you would put garbage
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.600]   and dead people and dead animals.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.200]   It stunk there.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.880]   And not just that, but people would practice
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.920]   child sacrifice there by fire to the God of Molech.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.240]   They would take their babies there and set them on fire
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.320]   as a sacrifice to the God of Molech.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.720]   It was a dark place, a wicked place, a nasty place,
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.880]   a dirty place.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.360]   There were worms there and maggots there
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.720]   and you couldn't even stand the smell there.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.680]   And Jesus says, hey, that's the closest thing I got
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:58.280]   to explain to you what hell is like.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.520]   Remember Gehenna, the Valley of Hinnom?
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.400]   Hell, it's worse than that.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.400]   And so to this story, it takes place today
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.800]   before Jesus comes back.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.600]   And in Revelation 20, Jesus talks about the lake of fire.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.240]   And here's what I would tell you is what is coming
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.960]   is only worse than what is in this text.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.880]   That what's coming is only worse.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.000]   And so hell is wanting and never being satisfied
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.080]   for eternity.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.920]   Hell is realizing the goodness that was available
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.960]   and your choice of evil.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.320]   Don't you see what's going on?
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.480]   Is the rich man can see heaven.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.960]   Like across this chasm, he sees Abraham
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.140]   and he sees Lazarus.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.960]   Like the only thing worse than not getting into the party
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   is sitting outside the party and watching everyone
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.160]   enjoy the fun that you could have had forever.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.920]   You can see it.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.380]   It's like eternal FOMO.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.960]   You realize what you missed out on
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.040]   and it's right there in front of you.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.240]   You know that it was available to you
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.240]   and they're having the most blissful, incredible time
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.720]   while you suffer forever.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:19.140]   It's fixed and eternal.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.400]   Hell is fixed and eternal.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.860]   Verse 26, a great chasm.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.100]   He says, "And besides all of this,
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.780]   "between us and you is a great chasm,
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.040]   "which has been fixed,
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.700]   "so that those who want to go from here to you cannot,
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.500]   "nor can anyone cross over from there to us."
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.380]   Can I just read to you one of the most horrific verses
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.860]   in all of the scripture?
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.260]   Second Thessalonians chapter one, verses eight and nine.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.300]   He says this, listen.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.380]   "He will punish those who do not know God
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.940]   "and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.620]   "They will be punished with everlasting destruction
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.260]   "and shut out from the presence of the Lord
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.260]   "and from the glory of his might."
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.400]   See, it's fixed.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.740]   You gotta hear me on this.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.600]   This is the danger of universalism
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.220]   or the Unitarian movement
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.420]   that says that everyone eventually goes to heaven.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.040]   It's a heresy, okay, that is not true,
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.380]   not supported by scriptures or anything that Jesus said.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.660]   And we love it, we're really attracted to it.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.780]   I wish it was true because, right,
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:31.700]   because then like we could do away with this idea of hell
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.620]   and it feels loving.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.620]   It feels loving to tell someone that.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.660]   I liken it to, if you,
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.140]   anyone traveled internationally?
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.540]   Okay, have you ever been in like a third world airport
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.260]   or somewhere where you don't know the way
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.460]   and no one speaks your language?
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.780]   And I can remember, like I can think back
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.580]   of when I was coming back from Rwanda
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.260]   and I'm in this airport and I have no idea where to go
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.180]   and I can't find the guys that I came with.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.540]   And so if you're just kind of going from gate to gate
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.860]   and I'm like, okay, I can't even make sense of this.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.620]   And imagine you see me and I miss my family.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.140]   Like I wanna get home to my wife and my children.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.860]   I've been gone for 10 days and I just wanna go see them.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.900]   And I'm like, I don't know what to do.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.500]   And you come up to me and you're like,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.460]   JP, what are you doing?
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.540]   Hey man, what's wrong?
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.820]   You seem frazzled.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.500]   And I say, I just wanna go home, man.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.900]   I just wanna go home and I don't know which gate,
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.900]   which plane is gonna take me home.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.640]   And you say, oh bro, I got you.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.240]   Listen, just choose a plane you like.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.280]   Any of these will take you home.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.400]   Just choose the one that looks the best to you.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.340]   And you'll get there.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.040]   And just say in that hypothetical situation,
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.780]   I believed you.
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.380]   What's gonna happen is it's gonna feel so loving.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.700]   Man, are you serious?
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.540]   Any of these?
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.380]   Yeah, any of them.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.300]   Choose one you like.
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.480]   They all go to Dallas, Texas, DFW.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.780]   Oh man, we're gonna hug.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.180]   I'm gonna be like, thank you so much for loving me
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.180]   and showing me the way home.
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.340]   That's such great news 'cause I was scared.
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.780]   I was gonna choose the wrong one.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.820]   And it's so great to know that any of them
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.640]   will get me home.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.180]   Listen, I get on one of those planes
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.660]   and it takes me to North Korea or some place of unrest.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.980]   And I get off and they throw me in a cell
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.500]   and then they beat me for the rest of my life.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.340]   You know what, I'm not gonna think that was so loving.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:34.500]   I'm gonna be like, man, why did you lead me astray?
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.820]   Why did you do that?
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.560]   Why did you tell me something that was uninformed
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.380]   just because it felt good?
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.740]   Just because it felt right?
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.780]   Hell is an awful place and any illustration
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.580]   I could give you would fall short of the horrors.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.840]   And so how can a loving God send anyone there?
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.200]   It's the second question is who should be there?
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.120]   Who should be in hell?
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.480]   What is God's standard for heaven?
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.260]   God's standard is perfection.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.100]   He's a holy God.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.940]   And so who should be in hell?
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.900]   You ready for this answer?
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.760]   Everyone.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:26.340]   Everyone has fallen short of God's glory.
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.160]   Everyone should be there.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.140]   Everyone deserves hell.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.540]   We've all worshiped ourselves in place
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.180]   of a holy and mighty God.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.020]   None of us have met his standards.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.940]   We've all fallen short of his standards.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.180]   And so the second that he put us here on this earth,
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.280]   you can look backwards on your life.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.180]   Who here is satisfied with the way they pursued God today?
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.820]   Did everyone have the quiet time they had hoped?
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.980]   Did everyone pray as much as they had hoped?
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.060]   Did everyone study the scriptures as much as you would like?
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.660]   Did anybody get jealous of anyone today?
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.380]   Okay, anybody envy anyone's situation today?
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.580]   Anyone think about themselves a lot?
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.740]   Right, what if anybody who's ever Googled
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.160]   their own name goes to hell?
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.300]   We're all good, right?
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.540]   Anybody who's ever counted their likes on Instagram,
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.540]   they go to hell.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.860]   You good?
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.580]   You safe?
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.800]   Right, we all want to worship ourselves.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.460]   We don't wanna worship God, we want to be God.
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.740]   None of it, I mean, who shared the gospel
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.740]   with everyone they met with today?
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.100]   Who lived out the beliefs that they say
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.780]   that they have today?
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.180]   Who gave all of their money to the poor today?
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.720]   Who lived like there's a real eternity of heaven
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.920]   and you're gonna be with God forever
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.740]   and that's what matters most today?
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:48.500]   We all deserve hell.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:54.760]   We all fall short of what God has called us to.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.580]   And the goal is not that you would leave here
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.580]   and just stop doing those things,
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:06.080]   but that you would begin to ask why.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.880]   Why don't I live out what I say that I believe?
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.360]   And so who should be there?
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.760]   Those who cannot see the cross pass themselves.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.600]   They should be there.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.080]   Those who cannot see the cross pass themselves.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.720]   Do you see the delusionment, the disillusionment rather,
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.840]   of this rich man?
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.280]   He's still giving orders.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.960]   Lazarus, hey, give me a drink.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.840]   I'm thirsty.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.720]   It's like, dude, you're disillusioned.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.520]   You're in hell.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.280]   Lazarus, buddy, he's in heaven.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.060]   He can't even get to you.
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.200]   And there's nothing to drink in hell.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.040]   And this teaches us something really scary about sin
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.240]   that it carries us to a place of self-obsession
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.400]   so that we can't even see the gospel.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.200]   Right?
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.040]   We can't even see the gospel.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.200]   And what's dangerous about being where so many of us are,
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.880]   kind of what is left of the Bible belt
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.800]   is so many people here call themselves believers
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.520]   and say that they're Christians and followers of Jesus,
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.040]   but who really lives like they believe
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.240]   that this book is true?
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:16.220]   Who really dates, pursues purity, sobriety,
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:21.120]   Christ, evangelism, missions?
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.680]   Who really lives like this book is true,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.640]   like your life is really, we sing those songs,
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.960]   "Hey, my life."
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.540]   But who does it?
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:36.640]   We've missed God because we tried to become God.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.880]   See this rich man in the parable,
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.880]   he pursued his heaven here,
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.260]   and he used his resources to make himself more comfortable,
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.520]   and he overlooked the poor man at his gate.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.360]   He said, "No, no."
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.520]   He saw the guy with the sign, and he said,
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.340]   "Oh, you want money?
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.420]   "It's my money, not your money.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.440]   "I'm gonna do everything I can to dress a little better,
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.840]   "to drive something a little cooler,
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.400]   "to live in a better place.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.440]   "I'm not sharing my stuff with anybody."
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.160]   He made his heaven here.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.360]   He got caught up in the world.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.760]   Says, "Son," verse 25,
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.440]   "remember that in your lifetime
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.840]   "you received your good things."
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.400]   And so what if today, porch, what if we left this place,
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.640]   and we began to live out what we say we believe?
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.040]   You guys, just you guys in the room,
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.520]   and you guys in Fort Worth,
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.980]   and you guys in Houston, El Paso, Tulsa,
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.300]   wherever you're at listening, you would change the world.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.080]   You would start a revival.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.920]   You would start a great awakening
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.420]   if you just began to live like you say you believe.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.880]   But so many of us, we're running to hell
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.400]   as fast as we can, trying to build our heaven here,
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.000]   our own personal kingdom here.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.520]   Matthew 10, verse 39 says,
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.540]   "Whoever finds their life will lose it,
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.280]   "and whoever loses their life for Jesus' sake will find it."
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.000]   Matthew 16, verse 24,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.540]   "Then Jesus said to his disciples,
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.680]   "Whoever wants to be my disciple,"
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.620]   I wanna be your disciple, Jesus, I want, choose me, pick me,
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.260]   "must deny themselves and take up their cross
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.960]   "and follow me."
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.800]   But we're so stuck on ourselves.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.860]   We can't see Christ.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.640]   The rich man in the story
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.520]   never even realized his need for saving.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.620]   He didn't want God,
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.700]   and so why would God allow him to go somewhere
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.440]   that the greatest thing about it is that God's there?
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.500]   Like if you don't like spending time with God here,
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.300]   why do you hope that you're gonna go somewhere
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.640]   and spend eternity with God?
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.160]   Well, how?
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.620]   He had his heaven here.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.020]   This is why C.S. Lewis said
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.140]   that hell is locked from the inside,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.620]   because we, like two-and-a-half-year-olds,
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:08.340]   are saying, "I can do whatever I want,"
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.180]   and we don't wanna submit to God,
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.820]   and God says, "Fine, fine, I love you,
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.140]   "I've pursued you, I've died for you.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.580]   "Do whatever you want."
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:23.660]   There's those who say to God, "Thy will be done,"
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.020]   and those to whom God says,
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.780]   "No, thy will be done."
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.840]   If you don't want me,
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.100]   then go to a place where nothing there
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.100]   will remind you of me.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.380]   In fact, the only thing of God in hell is his wrath.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:48.140]   The only thing of God in hell
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.740]   is his anger towards your sin.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.600]   You know the only thing you can do in hell?
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.780]   Pay for your sins.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:59.560]   You know who doesn't go to hell?
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.460]   Those whose sins have been paid for.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:05.020]   It is that simple.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:13.480]   It's interesting that while we don't like
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.980]   the doctrine of hell,
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:20.720]   so many of us agree that someone should be there.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.300]   Hitler, yeah, man, he should go to hell.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.720]   Child rapists, yeah, they should go there.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.200]   Murderers, serial killers, yeah, they should go.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.280]   But when we draw the line,
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.360]   like where should the line stop?
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.120]   Right in front of me, that's where it should stop, right?
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.440]   Like somewhere over there, like pornographers,
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.560]   "Ah, I don't know about that."
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.680]   Those who have sex outside of marriage, "Ah, maybe not."
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.200]   Wherever, you wanna draw the line right in front of you.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.920]   I haven't done something as bad as they have, right?
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.140]   And that's the way that we think about it.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.020]   We want God to deal with evil.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.260]   We just don't want him to deal with our evil.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:10.260]   We want God to deal with wicked deeds, not just our deeds.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.220]   Here's what you need to know.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.560]   Every sin will be punished,
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.420]   either in eternity or on the cross.
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.820]   And you have a choice.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.800]   God, in his great love and mercy towards you,
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   has allowed you to choose where you want your sin paid for.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.160]   You can pay for it in eternity,
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   or you can acknowledge that it was paid for on the cross.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.700]   And when you acknowledge that it was paid for on the cross,
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.760]   you get to be with God forever in his kingdom.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.600]   You become the sons and the daughters of God.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.760]   This is what we just looked at at Easter.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.620]   The cross of Easter, the empty tomb, that happened for you.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.460]   Why?
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.740]   This is the craziest narrative in the world,
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.140]   that God would allow his son to die.
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.100]   A God who controls everything would allow his son
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.060]   to be brutally murdered and tortured
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.560]   outside of a city to death.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.640]   And he did it for you.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:17.380]   Christ paying for your sins.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.620]   Because none of us are good.
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.260]   You cannot be good enough to get to heaven.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.900]   The scripture says, Mark 10, verse 18,
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.200]   Jesus answered, "No one is good except God alone."
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.100]   Romans 3, verses 10 and 12,
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.260]   "As it is written, there is no one righteous, not even one.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.780]   "There is no one who understands.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.120]   "There is no one who seeks God.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.300]   "All have turned away.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.020]   "They have together become worthless.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.740]   "There is no one who does good, not even one."
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.160]   And so who can get to heaven?
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.140]   Not those who are good, but those who have been forgiven.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.620]   Those who have been forgiven.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.980]   He answered, the rich man answered,
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.220]   "I beg you, Father, send Lazarus to my family,
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.340]   "for I have five brothers.
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.680]   "Let him warn them so that they will not come
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.600]   "to this terrible, terrible place."
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.320]   Abraham replied, "They have Moses and the prophets.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.780]   "Let them listen to them.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.160]   "Let them read their Bibles and trust their Bibles."
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.460]   "No, Father Abraham," he said,
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.580]   "but if someone from the dead goes to them,
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.660]   "they will repent."
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.260]   And he said to them, "If they don't listen
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.120]   "to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced,
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.880]   "even if someone rises from the dead."
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.800]   Do you guys remember Jesus?
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.700]   Jesus raised someone from the dead.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.180]   Do you remember that?
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.000]   You guys remember that?
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.840]   Anybody remember?
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.020]   You grew up in Sunday school or something?
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.540]   Remember Jesus raised somebody from the dead?
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.640]   Come forth, it's John chapter 11.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.940]   What was that guy's name?
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.600]   Oh, wow, it was Lazarus, wasn't it?
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.680]   It's like Jesus leaves this story and says,
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.040]   "Okay, we'll test your theory."
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.040]   And he raises a Lazarus from the dead.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.040]   And you know what happened?
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.580]   Some people believed, but not the Pharisees.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:02.200]   In fact, they wanted to kill Lazarus.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.840]   It's John chapter 12, verses 10, 11.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.780]   So the chief priest made plans to kill Lazarus as well,
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.540]   for on account of him, many of the Jews
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.880]   were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.520]   And so it's so interesting that some people
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.780]   see a dead man walking and they say,
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.480]   "Man, that guy, he's gotta be God's son."
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.720]   And others see a dead man walking,
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.620]   they say, "Hey, let's kill him again.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.960]   "We're not gonna follow this Jesus character."
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.320]   And it's also in this text,
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.380]   a foreshadowing of Jesus coming back to life.
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.120]   Like if you're here and you're like,
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.180]   "Man, if God raised someone from the dead,
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.020]   "I'd worship him."
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.880]   Would you look to Sunday?
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.320]   'Cause he did.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.300]   And you shouldn't even know who Jesus is.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.380]   But he did a pretty amazing thing
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.160]   coming out of that grave and became world famous.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.980]   And so those who deny the message of the one
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.680]   who came back from the dead will be there.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.140]   Those who deny the message of the one
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.900]   who came back from the dead will be there.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.600]   'Cause as I said, every sin is paid for
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.260]   either in hell or on the cross.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.100]   You can send that out to your friends, right?
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.940]   Tell people that every sin is paid for
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.780]   either in hell or on the cross.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.140]   The only thing you do in hell is pay for sins.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.700]   And so what about those who've never heard?
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.360]   What about you?
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.840]   What about babies?
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.680]   What about you?
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:25.180]   I was sharing the gospel with a guy
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.100]   and he said, "Man, I don't believe in God."
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.460]   I said, "Why not?"
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.660]   He said, "Because not everybody's heard the gospel."
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.980]   I just, I can't get my head around that.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.140]   Like not everyone's heard the gospel
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.920]   and so I just, I reject God.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.780]   Like if he's gonna send people to hell
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.420]   that have never heard who he is
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.700]   and I'm just like, "What about you?
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.940]   "Have you heard the gospel?"
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.740]   You, like think about your argument, it breaks down.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.060]   Are you gonna say, "You know what, man?
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.940]   "I'm no longer gonna take a paycheck
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.020]   "because not everybody gets a paycheck.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.840]   "So I'm just gonna stop taking one.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.600]   "You know what, I'm gonna live on the streets
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.120]   "because not everyone has a house.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.820]   "So I'm gonna live on the streets."
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.260]   That's crazy.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.160]   That is a ludicrous idea.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   And they always say, "Well, what about, you know,
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.640]   "the Bush man in Africa?
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.880]   "What about the tribal warrior in the Amazon?"
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.840]   To which I said, "You know what, man?
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.360]   "I was in Africa.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.280]   "I was in the Bush and I met a person
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.400]   "who trusted Christ in their dream, bro.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.580]   "In their dream.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.840]   "Like God showed up in their dream
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.980]   "and shared the gospel with them.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.480]   "And I've been on the Amazon.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.520]   "I've been in the Amazon jungle.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.200]   "I went down the Amazon River for six days,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.620]   "got off in a village where they told me,
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.380]   "Hey, these people have never heard about Jesus.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.540]   "I was so excited.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.740]   "I set foot off the boat.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.580]   "Hey, how are you doing?
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.420]   "Have you heard of Jesus?"
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.720]   And they pointed to a church they had just built.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.720]   And they say, "Yeah.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.640]   "Yeah, we know Jesus.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.400]   "We just heard about him.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.080]   "We built that church to worship him."
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.640]   And so you wanna talk about the person,
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.200]   I don't know about the person who has never heard,
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.000]   but what about the one who has?
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.440]   You're gonna get up there and say,
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.940]   "Hey God, the reason I rejected you
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.600]   "is 'cause some other people hadn't heard about you."
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.380]   Man, don't do that.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.540]   Don't do that.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.640]   This guy goes on to say,
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.480]   "Here's what I'd encourage you to do, buddy.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.240]   "I'd encourage you to think about Jesus.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.320]   "Like Jesus lived.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.820]   "I believe that there was a man named Jesus,
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.840]   "but he was just a man."
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.680]   I said, "Really?
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.000]   "Like Jesus Christ, he was just a man?"
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.600]   "Yeah, Jesus Christ was just a man.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.440]   "Born in Bethlehem?
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.260]   "Yeah, born in Bethlehem.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.100]   "Lived in Nazareth?
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.600]   "Yeah, that Jesus, just a man."
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.320]   Say, "How do you know about Jesus?
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.160]   "How do you even know who he is?"
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.080]   He said, "Well, everyone knows about Jesus."
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.880]   I said, "You just said they didn't."
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.640]   I said, "How do you know about Jesus?"
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.480]   He said, "Well, you know.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.800]   "I mean, it's written."
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.640]   "Wait, where?
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.460]   "Where is it written?"
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.300]   "In the Bible."
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.120]   I said, "Okay, hold on.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.340]   "What does the Bible say about Jesus?
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.580]   "Like why would you embrace the book
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.240]   "that says there was a Jesus
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.700]   "and yet reject who the book says he was?
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:54.720]   "How can you do that?
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.080]   "You're gonna hold fast to some ideas,
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:57.920]   "but reject others?
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.060]   "You get to choose what's true and what's not.
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:00.900]   "Is that it?
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.760]   "Like you're gonna take this
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.140]   "and just kinda cut it apart
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.720]   "and choose the verses you like
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.680]   "and get rid of the ones you don't?
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.560]   "How can you do that?"
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.400]   And you say, "Okay, JP,
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.240]   "the hell is so horrific.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.040]   "How can God send anyone there?"
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.280]   It's the wrong question.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.920]   How can a perfect, loving, good God
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.480]   allow any sinful person in his presence?
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.360]   How?
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:30.160]   How can a holy, righteous, perfect God
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.180]   allow anyone who's ever masturbated
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.900]   or been drunk or looked at pornography
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.540]   or had sex outside of marriage
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.100]   or cursed or stole or lied or cheated,
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.380]   how can that God allow any of those people
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.820]   in his presence
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.680]   that we've been running from him
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.460]   since we showed up on the scene?
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.260]   And God, I mean, we've been running toward hell
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.100]   since we showed up on the scene
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.040]   and God in his mercy has changed some of our hearts.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:00.900]   And you say, "Well, what about me?
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.420]   "How do I know if he's changed my heart?"
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.780]   Friend, would you consider where you are
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:04.800]   on a Tuesday night?
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.840]   You are, here's a reality check for you, bro.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.980]   God loves you so much
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.900]   that he had you come on hell day.
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.780]   You could've came on like
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.480]   justification day, but you came on hell day.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.260]   That's how much God loves you.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:29.740]   That in his sovereignty, he has you here.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.540]   He's provided a means for forgiveness.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.580]   He's provided a way for everyone to get to him.
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.100]   He's a loving God.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.500]   And it's through Jesus.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.100]   I was talking to a young lady yesterday
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.640]   and I just asked her, "Did you celebrate Easter?"
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.480]   She said, "Yeah."
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.300]   I said, "What did you do?"
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.220]   She said, "It was with my family."
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:50.820]   It was a person I had just met at the gym.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:54.540]   And she said, "Yeah, I was with my family.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.620]   "Went to church and whatnot."
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.380]   And I said, "So you have faith?"
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.220]   She said, "Oh, yeah."
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.860]   I said, "Let me ask you two questions."
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:01.700]   She said, "Sure."
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.900]   I said, "Between one and 10, 10 being certain,
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.260]   "one being not so sure, if you died today,
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.860]   "how certain are you that you'd go to heaven?"
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.940]   She said, "Oh, I'm a 10."
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.020]   I said, "Great, second question."
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.420]   God says, "Why should I let you in?
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.860]   "What would you say?"
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.620]   She said, "Because I love everyone.
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:22.220]   "I'm really loving, I love people."
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.060]   And I said, "Do you think everyone
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.940]   "who loves people goes to heaven?"
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.780]   She said, "I think that's really foundational
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.500]   "to getting there."
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.420]   And I said, "You said you celebrated Easter yesterday.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.100]   "This was yesterday, so Easter was the day before."
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:33.940]   And she said, "Yeah, I celebrated Easter."
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.020]   I said, "What happened on Easter?"
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.580]   She said, "Jesus died for our sins, raised from the dead."
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.240]   I said, "Why not that as your answer,
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.020]   "that God paid for your sins?"
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.600]   She said, "Well, it just feels so exclusive."
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.260]   Friends, you don't get to choose.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:51.140]   Like, if heaven is God's place,
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.940]   he gets to choose how you get there.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:57.480]   And you don't get there by rejecting his pathway.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.000]   That's foolish.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.680]   That's really closed-minded of you.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.640]   I would let the one who created heaven
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.960]   tell you how to get there.
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.500]   I would let the one who came from heaven
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.360]   show you the way to get there.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.820]   And it's just like, you gotta trust.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.020]   She's like, "Well, God is love.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.400]   "How do you know God is love?
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.820]   "Where did you learn that God is love?
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.200]   "Where does it say that God is love?"
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.720]   Well, the Bible says that God is love.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.080]   What else does the Bible say?
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.120]   It also says that he's the way, the truth, and the life,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.840]   and no one gets to the Father except through him.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.680]   Right, it says this idea that there's a hell,
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.960]   and you get there by telling people
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.080]   that the way they get to heaven is by being loving.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.120]   Like, how can you choose what you believe
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.600]   that's in the Bible?
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.440]   You, like, if the Bible said,
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.560]   "Hey, the way you get to heaven
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.360]   "is do 1,000 pushups every day,"
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.120]   then I would be completely ripped.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.360]   But that's not what it says.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.660]   It says the way you get to heaven
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.120]   is by believing that Jesus Christ died for your sins,
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.340]   and God raised him from the dead.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:10.440]   See, God is just, and he will not compromise his character.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.560]   And justice requires a consequence,
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.180]   or a payment for sin, a sentence.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:22.400]   But God is loving, and he paid the consequence
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.000]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   And so he is best for us,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.760]   and he will use anything to draw us to him,
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.880]   including an ultimatum.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.240]   And you say, "Well, if God's gonna give me an ultimatum,
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.480]   "man, screw it, I ain't going there.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.200]   "No, I'm not worshiping him."
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.560]   And buddy, you don't win.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.260]   That's not wise.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.160]   I would not bow up to the creator of the universe.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.620]   You don't get to choose.
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.300]   You don't get to choose.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.760]   And I think often we think that God hates
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.640]   those that go to hell.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.100]   I love that Abraham calls the man in hell son.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.800]   And this man, this rich man,
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.140]   his thirst will never be quenched.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.800]   But Jesus says, in John 6, 35,
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   Jesus declared, "He who believes in me
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.600]   "will never be thirsty."
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.120]   I want you to know Jesus injured hell
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.440]   so that you don't have to.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.780]   Talked to another young lady who,
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:23.920]   I said, "Do you believe in heaven?"
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.760]   And she said, "No."
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.600]   I said, "Do you believe in hell?"
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.420]   She said, "Yeah."
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:27.680]   I said, "How do you believe in hell and not heaven?"
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.000]   She said, "Oh, I'm going to hell."
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.920]   I said, "Why would you say that you're going to hell?"
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.240]   She said, "Man, I've just done some things.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.280]   "Done some really terrible things."
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.100]   I said, "Have you heard of Jesus?
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.440]   "Do you think Jesus, creator God,
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.640]   "is big enough to pay for the terrible things you did?"
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.840]   See, and I shared the gospel.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.880]   I said, "That's what happened on the cross at Calvary,
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.800]   "is Christ paid for your sins,
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.280]   "and God raised him from the dead."
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:56.960]   She said, "You mean that Jesus Christ paid for my sins
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.440]   "so that I don't have to?"
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.280]   I said, "Yeah."
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.280]   She said, "Wow, that's great news."
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.640]   And I said, "You get it, you got it."
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.800]   Praise God, it's great news.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.280]   And so how should we respond?
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.900]   If this is hell, how should we respond?
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.800]   Listen, some of you need to hear this first part.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.960]   How should you respond?
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.380]   This is what you need to hear tonight.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.560]   This is the only thing you need to hear tonight.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.520]   You trust in the one who is pointing you to life.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.920]   You will not be able to endure this life correctly,
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.240]   and you will not make it to eternal life with him
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.880]   without trusting in God's provision,
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.200]   his allotment in Jesus Christ, his son.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.540]   2018 years ago, he came to the earth and reset the time.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.760]   God is after you, you're here.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.000]   He doesn't want you to go to hell.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.760]   He is trying to communicate that to you right now.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.960]   He loves you.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.440]   In the morning time, he turns on the light for you.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.000]   He's given you songs, a soundtrack played through birds
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.200]   and creation.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.040]   He's given you the seasons.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.120]   He grows flowers for you in the springtime.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.640]   He brings you flowers.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.300]   He's crazy about you.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.940]   And right here in this text, you have a message from hell.
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.920]   It's a guy saying, "Hey, go tell them
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.520]   "that they don't want to be here."
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.180]   He said, "If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets,
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.340]   "they will not be convinced,
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.840]   "even if someone raises from the dead."
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.000]   And I'm telling you, someone did raise from the dead,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.480]   and that is your way to get to eternal life.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.560]   If you go back to that airport illustration,
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.360]   I'm there, you come up to me, you say,
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.200]   "Hey, choose the plane that you like the most.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.360]   "It's gonna get you to home."
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.780]   But then my other friend comes up and he says,
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.780]   "No, JP, not all of these planes, that's crazy.
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.580]   "Not all of these planes are gonna take you home.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.420]   "It's D7.
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.980]   "You want gate D7.
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:46.440]   "That's what's going to take you to Dallas."
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.600]   And that other person says,
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.980]   "You're telling me just one plane?
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.980]   "That's so close-minded.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.540]   "Why would you say such a thing?
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.240]   "That's unloving."
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.700]   And here's the deal.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.240]   The person who is saying D7 can say it
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.880]   with the confidence of knowing
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.320]   that I'm going to learn the truth.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.320]   You get to share the gospel with somebody.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.320]   Hey, you can choose Jesus Christ,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.740]   believing that he died for your sins,
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.200]   and God raised him from the dead.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.560]   And if you do not choose that, you will go to hell.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.960]   And I don't want you to go to hell,
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.120]   so I want you to choose Jesus.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.240]   And when you share that,
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.720]   you know that that person is going to learn the truth.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.040]   Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess,
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.500]   and they will say, "Wow, thank you so much
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.300]   "for loving me enough to show me
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.220]   "that D7 is the only plane that's gonna take me home."
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.400]   Or they're gonna say,
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.640]   "Man, I wish I would have listened to you."
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.300]   But you get to share from the confidence
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.480]   of knowing that they will know the truth.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.840]   And God tells us the truth,
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.260]   but we want freedom like Presley.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.480]   And so what do we do?
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   We serve others.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.120]   That's what you spend your life serving others.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.000]   Like the rich man should have served Lazarus,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.340]   not to be saved, but as evidence that you are saved,
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.680]   so that they might become saved.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.560]   And the rich man was here with excess
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.680]   when Lazarus had need and he ignored him.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:07.480]   And so you don't love others so that you don't go to hell.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.700]   You love others so that they don't go to hell.
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.900]   You point them to the way.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.760]   What else do you do?
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.420]   You share with everyone.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.700]   You share with everyone with the confidence
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.340]   that they are going to know the truth,
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:23.140]   that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:27.300]   And no one gets to heaven except by entering
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.420]   through the narrow gate that is Jesus Christ,
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.420]   believing that he paid for your sins
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.100]   so that you don't have to.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.660]   It's the great exchange.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.500]   Jesus got what you deserve,
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.480]   and if you believe that he got what you deserve
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.780]   on the cross, then you get what he deserves.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.140]   You become a son and a daughter to God,
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.900]   the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:50.400]   You gain an eternal inheritance.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.760]   You get to be with God forever.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.500]   And so in summary, hell is not a place we wanna be.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.100]   And everyone deserves to be there,
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.080]   but those who have trusted in God's provision
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.380]   through Jesus become sons and daughters of God.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.220]   They get what Jesus deserves,
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.860]   trusting that Jesus got what they deserve.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.940]   And thirdly, we respond to hell by trusting in God's word,
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.900]   serving others with our resources,
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.020]   and telling everyone we can the good news
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.980]   that Jesus Christ died in our place
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.460]   so that they can be with him,
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.580]   so that we can be with him forever.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:31.420]   What I did with my daughter when she said that
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:37.180]   is she said, "I can do whatever I want."
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.900]   And I said, "Really?"
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.860]   I just grabbed the trash can and said,
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:45.960]   "Hey, I just want you to look at that, okay?
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   "I'll be right back."
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.340]   I think she thought I was gonna throw her away,
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.500]   which I wouldn't do, but.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:55.420]   I went and I got some things and I came back,
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:51:01.380]   said, "I got this for you today, but you lost it forever."
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.080]   And she looked at me and she goes,
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.320]   (growling)
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.220]   "I can do whatever I want!"
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.140]   I said, "I was afraid you were gonna say that.
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.100]   "See, I'm your daddy, I love you, I'm crazy about you.
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.900]   "Man, I've got good things that you don't even know exist.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.860]   "And this is the good stuff.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.880]   "These are C's lollipops.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.100]   "I've had 'em in the utility room.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.840]   "I was gonna give 'em to you at just the right time.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:34.240]   "This is the good stuff, but you lost that forever."
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.080]   Forever.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.280]   And she didn't say anything.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.420]   It began to click.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:47.540]   That her daddy loves her and has good things for her,
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:51.220]   and her choices are only costing her,
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:55.020]   her daddy's goodness, her daddy's grace,
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.260]   and her daddy's provision.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.180]   Her daddy does not desire to rip her off,
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.380]   but to set her free, to show her life.
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.820]   She thinks at two and a half
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.740]   that she knows better than her daddy.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.420]   And she doesn't, and it's foolish,
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:12.140]   and it's just as foolish when you do it.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.520]   And so she lost out on the goodness
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.520]   that I had for her forever.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:23.900]   But here's the deal.
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.540]   I'm crazy about my daughter, man.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:28.820]   And I love to give her good things.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:31.100]   This thing comes in its own carrying case.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:39.780]   This is a replica of the first one that I gave to her,
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:42.280]   because I love her, not on that day.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.820]   I saved it for just the right time.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.780]   Said, "Hey, I know you love lollipops,
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.820]   "and I love to give you good things,
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.980]   "so I thought we could share this one together."
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.500]   And if you think her eyes were big
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.820]   when I pulled out that Tootsie Pot,
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.060]   she was going crazy.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:03.180]   And I say that because God has good things for you,
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.980]   better than you could ever imagine.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.380]   And you're missing out on them
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.500]   by choosing the way that seems right to you,
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.100]   but in the end leads to death.
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.540]   Will you please stop?
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:17.020]   Well, right now, as we sing this last song,
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:20.460]   would you just say, "God, all my life,
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:23.400]   "I've laid it down.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:28.160]   "I wanna be defined by Christ
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.280]   "who was crucified for me.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.720]   "The life that I live in the body,
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:38.440]   "I live by Christ, His power, His spirit."
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.320]   Your response to this,
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.040]   everyone, believer and non-believer alike,
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.400]   your response is surrender.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.520]   Lord, this is my life.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.440]   I want you to take it.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.940]   So let me pray that you would.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.880]   Father, I thank you that you're a God of grace.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:59.760]   You're a God of good things.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.880]   And you don't desire, you tell us in the scripture
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.840]   that you do not delight in sending anyone to hell.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:10.080]   And that you're not slow in keeping your promises,
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.460]   as some understand slowness,
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.320]   but you're patient with us,
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.880]   not wanting anyone to perish,
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.000]   but everyone to come to repentance.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.520]   Father, tonight, I pray there's a wave
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.480]   through Dallas, Texas, and Houston, Texas,
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.960]   and Tulsa, Oklahoma, and El Paso, Texas,
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:29.120]   and Fort Worth, Texas, and all over the world,
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.880]   a wave of young adults saying,
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.720]   "Lord, here I am.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.420]   "I surrender my life to you.
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.260]   "I surrender my will to you.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.500]   "I don't wanna be like the rich man
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.760]   "who enjoyed his pleasures on earth,
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.760]   "but missed out on them in eternity.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.580]   "I wanna be like the beggar Lazarus.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:53.500]   "Lord, make us like the beggar Lazarus,
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.600]   "begging for bread from your table
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:59.020]   "so that we might dine with you for eternity.
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:02.340]   "Lord, would you take our lives?
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.000]   "We love you, and we thank you for this text.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.600]   "We thank you for your son who spoke these words.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.540]   "It's in his name, Jesus' name, amen."
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:21.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
