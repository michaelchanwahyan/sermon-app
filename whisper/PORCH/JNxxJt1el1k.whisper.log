[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.080]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.120]   Man, welcome friends in the room.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.480]   Gosh, I feel like we could go home, that worship set.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.920]   Man, and I'm sure it was the same in Fort Worth
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.120]   with Jared and in Houston and just everywhere.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.940]   But welcome friends,
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.680]   we are kicking off a new series tonight, The Remnant.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.540]   What is The Remnant?
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.960]   It is not the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and the bear.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.220]   It is a word that means the people of God
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.640]   or the people that God has set apart, the faithful ones.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.880]   So I'm gonna start with a little bit of a story
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.920]   that recently took place,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.760]   that'll give us some tracks before we're going.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.480]   About a week and a half ago, I got on a plane with JP,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.080]   who also is one of the primary communicators
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.960]   and leader of this Dallas campus
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.980]   and really Watermarket General.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.400]   We went to London for a gathering for young leaders,
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.000]   young pastors that are kind of under 40.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.680]   Essentially, he got invited to come to this thing
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.360]   and he was like, "Hey, you wanna go free trip to London?
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.200]   "I'm in."
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.120]   And so we went over there and we were together
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.560]   with about 70 other leaders from churches
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.880]   that were in Canada and in Australia and in Europe
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.720]   and in Germany and Sweden.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.120]   And so it was gonna be kind of a time to collaborate
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.560]   and get to know and exchange ideas
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.520]   and just hear what their ministry context are looking like.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.400]   And I don't know what you know about Europe,
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.680]   but if you hear any of the news
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.000]   and any of the news clippings that are out there,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.920]   it's essentially that the church,
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.680]   you don't always hear a bright picture painted.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.480]   That it's almost like, hey, whatever is going on there,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.140]   it's not church inside of Europe.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.480]   That it's either losing
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.560]   or it honestly already lost that battle long ago.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.440]   And so the vibrant ministries really are nothing
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.080]   like you're gonna see inside of America.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.960]   So I was going over there thinking,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.720]   man, I don't know what this is gonna look like
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.340]   and I'm sure we're gonna meet with pastors
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.320]   who live in a very different context
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.440]   than Dallas and the Bible Belt.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.880]   And so maybe it'll just be a chance we encourage them.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.600]   I was almost like, it may even be kind of awkward
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.440]   to talk about what God is doing here in the midst of it,
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.760]   'cause if it's in Sweden
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.720]   and just the high atheist agnostic population all over Europe
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.680]   it's gonna be maybe our chance to just encourage them
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.460]   and be like, man, here's why you matter.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.900]   Keep going, keep getting after it.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.800]   'Cause if I'm them or I'm already thinking in my mind,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.880]   man, if I'm leading in Germany or in Sweden
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.680]   or Australia or Canada, I might be thinking,
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.520]   like I haven't seen people come to trust in Jesus
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.320]   or come to trust Christ in a long time.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.720]   My ministry is just a few people versus a few thousand.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.320]   And so all this is kind of going through my mind.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.780]   It'll just, I guess, be a chance for us
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.320]   to kind of encourage and keep going
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.080]   and let us remind you why you matter.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.520]   I'm gonna pick up that story
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.580]   and a little bit of what took place.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.180]   But I start there because
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.380]   what we're gonna kick off this series with
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.720]   is looking at Jesus's words,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.840]   what he would say to those pastors and those leaders
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.560]   and really to anyone who is a follower of Christ,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.960]   anyone who is a part of the remnant,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.960]   anyone who's a Christian,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.000]   not that they claim to be a Christian,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.720]   but anyone who is actually following Jesus
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.860]   or a follower of Jesus,
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.560]   what Jesus is gonna say to you,
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.960]   if that fits your description, why you matter.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.360]   Just like I assumed we're gonna go over there
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   and have a chance to remind them,
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.720]   hey, as you, as the presence of God in Sweden,
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.400]   here's why you matter, here's what God is doing.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.000]   Tonight, we're gonna look at a passage of scripture
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.560]   where Jesus, if he could speak to the body of Christ,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.840]   he essentially does at that time,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.040]   he says, as my followers,
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.280]   here's why you matter to the world around us.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.240]   And I don't know if you've ever thought
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.160]   of that question before.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.880]   Maybe to you, you're like, yeah, duh, it matters,
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.600]   it gives me something to do on a Tuesday night.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.760]   But if you really were honest and you begin to think,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.520]   like, does Christianity really matter?
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.040]   Like, if you removed all of the Christians
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.520]   off the entire face of the planet
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.380]   and they all of a sudden just disappeared,
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.880]   would it really make that big of a difference?
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.200]   Like, would things look a ton different?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.520]   Would it turn into Lord of the Flies
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.020]   and everyone's got Piggy's head on a stick
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.180]   and things are just going crazy?
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.040]   If you guys would have read that book in eighth grade,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.480]   that would have been funny, okay?
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.760]   Cliff notes.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.400]   And so, would it turn into that?
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.720]   What would happen?
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.280]   If you actually removed the people of God,
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.680]   I mean, think about it, and maybe you have an answer.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.000]   Maybe you're not really in the whole church thing
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.600]   and somebody just invited you and you're like,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.820]   yeah, finally, get off my case,
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.440]   I'll come with you to this porch thing.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.560]   And you think, man, if you got rid of all the Christians,
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.800]   I'm not even sure the world would look any better.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.400]   Or I mean, any worse, it may look even better.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.200]   Be less judgment, less hypocrisy.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.440]   Maybe that's what you think.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.080]   But regardless of where you are on the spectrum,
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.920]   I mean, think about it.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   If you removed all of the Christian presence in this age,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.780]   maybe throughout history, how would it change our world?
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.800]   How would it look different?
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.760]   And the answer is found really in tied to what Jesus says
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.200]   the role of his followers has plays, will always play
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.520]   in every culture, in every society, on every continent,
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   in every place, and every age.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.960]   But he's gonna tell us why the body of Christ,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   Christ followers, are so crucial to our world.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.880]   And if you were to remove them,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.120]   or when their presence is removed from a place,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.000]   what will happen?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.400]   So we're gonna be in Matthew chapter five.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   If you have a Bible, you can flip over
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.440]   to Matthew chapter five.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.280]   We're gonna look at a passage
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.560]   that you may have heard before.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.800]   You may have heard, even talked on before,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.520]   but we're gonna see Jesus's words to his followers
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.840]   about why they matter.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.200]   Tonight we're gonna kick off about why God
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.620]   always preserves a remnant.
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.600]   That he's always preserved a people, set aside a people,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.120]   faithful and devoted to him in every age,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.320]   and really in every place all over the world.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.040]   And we're gonna see that starting in verse 13.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.960]   This is Jesus's first message
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.600]   to really anyone that we know of.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.680]   And it's called often the Sermon of the Mount.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.800]   If you may have heard that term before,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.680]   Sermon of the Mount, Matthew chapter five through seven.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.720]   He basically gathers on the side of a mountain or a mount,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.040]   and he looks out into his followers,
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.040]   and he begins to say, here's why you matter to the world.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.400]   And we're gonna see three things that God is doing,
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.720]   always is doing through the remnant, was then and is now.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.380]   And if you're a part of the remnant,
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.160]   this is what he's doing and wants to do through your life
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.980]   and through my life.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.920]   Starting in verse 13.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.120]   Jesus says, "You are the salt of the earth.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.160]   "But if salt loses its saltiness,
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.640]   "how can it be made salty again?
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.620]   "It's no longer good for anything
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.760]   "except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot."
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.040]   Jesus, what are you saying?
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.920]   We're a condiment?
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.960]   Why are your followers salt?
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.080]   And what does that even mean?
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.520]   And what do you mean by trampling underfoot?
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.560]   That doesn't sound great, whatever you mean by it.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.960]   Here's what the context around salt in Jesus's age.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.920]   Very different time period.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.480]   We'd have to, if we go back on a time machine,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.800]   here's one thing that we would notice about first century,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.040]   that they didn't have something called refrigeration.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.680]   And so inside of that context,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.760]   because there was no electricity,
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.360]   there's no ability to freeze food.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.560]   You didn't have like ice makers and ice machines.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.280]   I know, I went to seminary.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.680]   This is graduate level stuff.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.600]   And so inside of that context,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.280]   in order to keep food from going bad,
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.160]   in order to stop it from decaying, they would use salt.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.320]   That salt was this preservative.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.220]   So in other words, hey, you killed the calf.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.160]   We got two options.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.140]   We're either gonna go big time barbecue right now
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.980]   and fill ourselves up,
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.360]   or we can keep the meat from rotting as quickly
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.400]   by putting salt on top of it.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.400]   Salt was primarily a preservative.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.160]   It was extremely valuable.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.960]   In fact, even if you look at the tracing of the word salary,
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.600]   it comes from salt, sal,
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.360]   because they would pay people in salt
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.140]   because of the enormous value that it had,
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.400]   that it was this preservative
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.880]   and the ability to preserve food.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.160]   And Jesus looks into his audience and says,
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.420]   you are like the preservative of a world
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.800]   that is rotting and decaying.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   The world is gonna decay slower with your presence there.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.160]   Your city, your state, the places you live, your job,
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.620]   the apartment complex you live in is gonna decay slower
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.800]   if there's Christian Christ-following people
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.160]   that are present there.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.980]   The first idea from the text is that the remnant
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.840]   is the preservative of the world,
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.860]   or the remnant always preserves our world.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.240]   What does Jesus mean by the fact that,
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.200]   well, hey, if it loses its saltiness,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.840]   it's not good for anything but to be trampled.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.480]   Can salt even lose its saltiness?
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.640]   How does that happen?
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.520]   What is he saying?
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.840]   Here's what the process for getting salt
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.920]   in the first century, and this maybe will make sense to you
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.160]   if you've read this first and wondered
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.200]   what does that mean before.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   Oftentimes, the way salt was accumulated
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.400]   or the way that they got salt
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.360]   was because they lived right next to the ocean.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.040]   They would go and they would pick up seaweed
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.040]   and they'd pick up all kinds of different minerals
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.880]   and salt things that would accumulate on the shores,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.080]   and they would bring them in and there would be salt
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.900]   in the mix of seaweed and the mix of sticks
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.920]   and different things that were there,
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.360]   and they would take that salt that had accumulated
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.440]   from the ocean, salt water, and they would rub it on meat
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.680]   and they would rub it on the foods
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.880]   that they were trying to preserve.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.280]   Then, when all the salt is off of there,
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.240]   they would take it and they would throw it
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.560]   on the top of their thatched roof homes
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.200]   where people would walk.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.880]   And so, I mean, if you read it with that in mind,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.440]   it makes perfect sense what Jesus is saying.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   Hey, if salt is no longer something
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.800]   that is providing and preserving anymore,
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.520]   it's something that you're gonna just throw out
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.640]   is essentially his point.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.120]   And he's saying you, as the people of God,
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.440]   have been put where you are to be a preservative
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.480]   to the world around you, to stop it from decaying.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.920]   Now, what does that even mean, Jesus?
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.480]   How are we stopping the world from decaying?
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.480]   It's not like you leave these doors
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.800]   and all of a sudden it smells terrible
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.200]   because it's like rotten food everywhere.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.280]   What are you saying?
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.480]   The picture Jesus in the Bible presents
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.060]   is that our world is fractured and broken
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.460]   in every way imaginable.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.480]   Human nature is fractioned and broken.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.340]   That the world around us is broken
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.660]   and that God has put Christians and Christ followers
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.300]   on the planet to slow down through the way
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.540]   that they live their life,
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.840]   through the values that they hold to,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.100]   through the perspectives that they have on things
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.820]   to slow down the decay of culture and of our world.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.380]   Here's what I mean.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.820]   It is the Christian message
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.420]   that is not just one of eternal life.
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.220]   The Christian message, and this is so huge,
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.260]   even if you're not a believer,
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.940]   this will finally bring some sense.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.020]   And you may not even be able to fully grab
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.100]   onto what I'm saying because you've been so indoctrinated
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.220]   by a Christian worldview and you don't even realize it.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.660]   It is the Christian message that gives not just the message
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.220]   of eternal life, but of a better life in this world.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.180]   And if you take away the message of the body of Christ
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.260]   and the message of Christianity,
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.140]   if you would remove it from history,
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.980]   you're gonna remove things that have uniquely
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.500]   been introduced through the church.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.500]   Here's one example.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.300]   The idea of the sanctity of life,
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.900]   that every person matters, every life matters,
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.220]   every person, whether they're white, black, Asian,
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.420]   or anything across the board, whatever the color of your skin,
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.480]   whatever your sex, male or female, that you matter,
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.740]   you are someone who matters to God
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.720]   and you should matter to me.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.980]   That is a uniquely Christian message.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.340]   And you may be going, well, I know atheists
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.800]   that hold onto that message because they have grown up
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.660]   in an environment where that Christian moral foundation
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.040]   was introduced to them.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.260]   How do I know that's true?
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.620]   If you look around, if you've traveled it all
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.260]   outside of the West, it becomes very apparent
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.480]   that not everyone thinks like us.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.100]   Have you noticed that?
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.420]   Like, there's a reason why even the idea of,
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.980]   hey, men and women are equal, even me saying that
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.180]   is kind of making some of you being like,
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.580]   yeah, why do you even have to say that?
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.980]   Duh, men and women are, we're out of here right now.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.920]   Even me introducing that makes you kind of be like,
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.620]   of course, that's not something universally accepted.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.980]   There's a reason Saudi Arabia, just in the past few months,
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.900]   gave women the right to drive cars.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.740]   And if you look all over the world,
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.380]   especially in places where there hasn't been
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.100]   a Christian moral foundation, and the value of life
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.860]   is not a universally accepted thing,
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.860]   there's a reason why there's 100 million more men
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.020]   in Asia than women.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.860]   You know why?
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.540]   Selective birth abortion.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.100]   If we find out it's a girl, we kill it
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.780]   because not all lives are equal.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.900]   And you're like, man, they are equal.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.520]   That's because you have been so saturated
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.460]   in a Christian moral foundation.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.060]   And we hold that it's true and it's right
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.620]   and it's the only way to think.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.420]   But it is not a universally, it's not natural.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.500]   It's not the way that people naturally and normally think.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.560]   The idea that, man, abortion in general
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.620]   is not a solution to problems.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.140]   The idea that, hey, men should cherish their wives
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.640]   and care for them is not a universally accepted truth
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.300]   that, hey, men, you should die to yourself
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.740]   and put the needs of your wife before her.
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.460]   And any time you fail to do that,
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.940]   you should ask for forgiveness
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.080]   and you should own it and confess that that was not right.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.640]   That's not something that universally
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.620]   people agree to and believe.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.100]   These are Christian things that the message of Christianity
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.380]   has introduced, not just how you can have eternal life,
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.060]   but a better life inside of our world,
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.780]   and it is not natural.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:57.020]   The Christian message introduced the idea that,
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.900]   hey, men, you should forgive because you've been forgiven.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.340]   What's natural is an eye for an eye.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.940]   If you stole from me, I get to steal from you.
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.080]   I mean, that's what the natural is,
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.280]   but the Christian message has all throughout time,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.380]   and even today, introduces something different.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.020]   That's why it's the preservative of a world
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.740]   that apart from it having the message of Jesus
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.140]   in the body of Christ is decaying
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.980]   and will decay faster and faster.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.260]   But these things, I mean, think about this.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.400]   Think if you removed all of the Christian presence
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.340]   throughout history, just like imagine with me.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.220]   Imagine like, hey, you could wave a magic wand
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.460]   and poof, it all disappeared.
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.620]   There was never any Christianity, no Christ.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.060]   Think how different our world would be.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.860]   What would have happened to slavery?
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.340]   And maybe going, wait a second, but Christians,
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.020]   in the name of Christianity, defended slavery.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.940]   There's always been phony Christians
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.220]   and people who missed the mark,
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.020]   people who didn't understand, but at the same time,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.580]   even in that age, there were the remnant who stood up,
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.980]   who gave their life saying slavery is wrong.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.580]   You could trace it hundreds and hundreds of years back
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.080]   where the body of Christ is saying this is abhorrent.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.960]   And the greatest evil inside of our land
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.660]   was fought by Christians, William Wilberforce,
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.900]   John Wesley, people who said, this is not okay,
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.100]   that every person is created equal in God's eyes.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.740]   And in the name of the message of Christianity, they fought.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.100]   Because here's what's crazy, I don't very often disagree
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.240]   with the founding fathers of the United States,
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.020]   'cause I'm an American, these colors don't run.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.740]   But here's where they had it off.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.860]   We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.300]   They were wrong, they're not self-evident truths.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.180]   You can turn on any TV, slavery is alive and well
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.040]   outside of nations or in lots of places
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.140]   that have no Christian moral foundation that's a part of it.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.100]   In fact, in 2003, it was reinstated by someone
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.500]   who's had significant leadership in the Islamic world
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.180]   that hey, we're gonna open back the policy for slavery,
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.740]   it'll always be a part of Islam.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.980]   And that didn't universally accept
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.940]   and that has nothing to do with inside of our context,
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.980]   but point being, that perspective
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.940]   that everyone is created equal is not a self-evident truth.
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.820]   How do Christians slow the decay of our world
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.360]   by introducing not just the message of eternal life,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.560]   but of a better life?
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.980]   You look at the civil rights movement,
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.420]   Martin Luther King Jr., you know what his job was
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.060]   before he became a man who turned the world
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.740]   upside down for the good?
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.460]   A pastor who was turning up his congregation
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.540]   upside down for the good and through the message of Christ.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.540]   That in every era, if you were to remove
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.540]   the Christian presence, how would our world look different?
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.980]   How would things be different?
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.740]   In other words, you can even look around
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.580]   and see it in the examples of hospitals.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.940]   And there's a reason why you don't see,
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.740]   hey, first atheist medical center over there,
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.560]   but you see Presbyterian, you see Baylor,
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.860]   you see, I mean, it's true.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.820]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.820]   Because the people of God, the remnant,
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.940]   has always said we're gonna provide health
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.540]   and healing and medicine for people,
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.360]   even if they can't afford it.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.860]   You don't hear about the, you hear about Salvation Army,
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.100]   you don't hear about the agnostic army
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.540]   that's going out there ringing bells.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.660]   That just doesn't happen because the people of God
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.220]   have introduced into this world,
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.700]   we think every person matters.
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.660]   We see it as our responsibility to fight poverty,
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.980]   not some government's, the body of Christ.
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.280]   We see it as our responsibility to fight injustice
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.340]   and to use our democratic voice
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.700]   to fight for justice anytime that we can.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.300]   But that's the remnant, that's the people of God.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.260]   If you remove that, you remove God's greatest gift
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.260]   to the world that I'm gonna slow the decay through you.
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.540]   Does the body of Christ matter?
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.980]   You matter more than you could possibly even understand.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.180]   You've mattered to history, you've mattered to this country,
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.680]   you've mattered to our world.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.980]   As every person in the body of Christ does everywhere.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.020]   Billy Graham, who fought alongside
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.320]   of Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.500]   to increase the civil rights presence,
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.240]   who said at My Tent Revivals,
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.100]   when it was illegal because of Jim Crow,
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.240]   I will not allow segregation.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.920]   And he personally would go up and down the aisle
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.940]   saying we're gonna sit everyone together
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.300]   if you're gonna be here.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.640]   It is the body of Christ.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.300]   Have they gotten it perfect at all times?
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.880]   No.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.840]   And the best thing we can do is own the places
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.980]   where we've missed it in every century.
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.860]   But it is the people of God who have been devoted
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.440]   to the values that scripture gives,
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.220]   that there's a God who loves every person
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.820]   and it is our responsibility to love
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.380]   and care for every person.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.780]   Jesus looks at his followers and says,
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.560]   man, you slow the decay of our world.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.140]   You, Christian, are the salt of the village apartments.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.980]   You're the salt of whatever place that you live,
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.940]   off of Oak Lawn or off of McKinney Avenue
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.860]   or wherever you live, whatever home that you're in,
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:52.960]   you are the salt of that neighborhood.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.380]   You're the salt of your work.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.480]   You're the preservative of that workplace.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.540]   That God looks and he says, yeah, placing you there.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.380]   There was a writer for the London Times
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.360]   who actually wrote, and London Times
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.020]   is kind of like the New York Times, only in London.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.600]   And he wrote about just how his observations,
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.500]   he said, I'm an atheist, but man,
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.820]   I'm a field reporter in Africa.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.260]   He was stationed in Africa and he would write
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.580]   and he said, man, I can't get over the ways
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.140]   that Christianity is at work here.
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.420]   And honestly, I'm an atheist,
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.520]   but we need more missionaries to come to Africa
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.420]   because they are the ones who are bringing healing.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.560]   Here's what he wrote inside of the London Times in 2010.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:34.260]   As an atheist, this is Matthew Paris from the London Times,
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.940]   I truly believe that Africa needs God.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.260]   This confounds, I love this,
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.700]   this confounds my ideological beliefs,
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.580]   as in like, I don't know what to do with this,
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.460]   stubbornly refuses to fit my worldview,
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.540]   and has embarrassed my growing belief that there's no God.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.700]   Though an atheist, I've become convinced
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.300]   of the enormous contribution that Christian evangelism
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.060]   makes in Africa, sharply distinct
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.340]   from the work of secular NGOs,
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.420]   government projects, and international aid efforts.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.920]   In other words, like hey, when government involvement
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.380]   just tries to provide the aid,
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.220]   it doesn't work the same as Christian evangelism does.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.580]   These alone will not do.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.200]   Education and training alone will not do.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.040]   In Africa, Christianity changes people's hearts.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.180]   And the change is good, preach.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.560]   Christians, black and white, working in Africa
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.280]   do heal the sick, do teach people to read and write,
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.740]   and only the severest kind of secularist or atheist
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.700]   could see a mission hospital and school and say,
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.300]   the world would be better without it.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.980]   Missionaries, not aid money,
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.460]   are the solution to Africa's biggest problem.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.900]   What Matthew identifies is really the truth
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.460]   that didn't have to exclusively do with Africa.
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.740]   They're the solution to America's biggest problem.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.900]   Followers of Jesus who walk and follow him,
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.380]   not just people who claim to be a Christian.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.600]   There's a lot of people in this room
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.580]   who claim to be a Christian,
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.620]   and they're not followers of Christ.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.220]   By that, they just mean like, I'm not Buddhist,
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.220]   and I'm not Islam, and I'm an American.
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.440]   Colors don't run again.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.000]   That's what a Christian is, right?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.020]   But they're not followers of Jesus,
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.700]   who are following him with their life,
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.940]   who have accepted him and his death and resurrection
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.960]   as the payment for their sin.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.480]   That's a follower of Christ.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.940]   And what Africa needs more of, what our world needs more of,
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.860]   and what Jesus says his body provides
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:38.060]   is the preservative to a world that is dying without it.
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.500]   They introduce the world to the message of eternal life
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.900]   and also a better life.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.140]   And Jesus continues, and he says,
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.660]   "Not only are you salt," he goes into another word picture,
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:52.660]   and he says this, "You are the light of the world.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.780]   "A town that's built on a hill cannot be hidden.
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.620]   "Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.100]   "Instead, they put it on its stand,
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.120]   "and it gives light to everyone in the house,
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.160]   "that people would put houses on the side of the hill
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.140]   "so that travelers, when it was dark outside,"
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.420]   'cause again, no electricity,
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.700]   "they would see off in the distance the city lit up."
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.420]   And then he goes into another illustration of like,
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.420]   in the same way that people don't just light a lamp
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.780]   and they don't put it in kind of random places,
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.880]   they put it very intentionally in a place,
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.140]   that's what God has done with his lights.
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.400]   And if you're a follower of Christ, that's who you are.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.860]   Here's what's relevant to the context.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.260]   Instead of the first century,
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.700]   they didn't have lots of lights.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.400]   Like, lights were a very valuable thing.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.600]   So you had a candle, and it was expensive, and oil.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.380]   And so you'd have really one-room houses.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.220]   And so people would live in one room,
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.580]   which had to be great with like, mom and dad being right there
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.060]   and so they would be in that room
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.900]   and they would have one lamp, usually speaking.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.980]   And they wouldn't put that lamp,
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.860]   and so Jesus' audience is listening going like,
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.420]   "Of course you wouldn't put it underneath the bowl.
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.740]   "Lamps are really expensive."
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.380]   You would put it very intentionally
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.660]   in the middle of the room to give as much light
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.820]   to the room around it as possible.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.980]   You're very purposeful with where you put your lights
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.580]   and Jesus says, "That's how God is with his lights."
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.940]   That when he looked at the world around us,
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.580]   he saw the followers of Jesus and he placed them
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.060]   into the different workplaces.
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.340]   If you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.420]   it's not a random accident that you work
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.100]   at the place that you work at.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.700]   It's not a random accident that you live
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.980]   with the roommates you live at,
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.740]   that you live with the neighbors around you
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.580]   that you live at.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.060]   But Jesus says, "God doesn't put lights without purpose.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.260]   "He puts them purposefully into the places that he's at."
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.260]   And here's why this is hard,
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.580]   'cause I think most of us look at it and we're like,
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.580]   "Dude, it's just random why I work
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.420]   "at the place that I work at.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.820]   "I don't even wanna work at the place that I work at.
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.320]   "I'm kinda waiting to get out of this job
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.820]   "and it's just kinda an in-between Starbucks kinda role
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.240]   "or I ended up getting hired here 'cause my aunt was like,
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.900]   "Hey, you should really consider working here.
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.100]   "It'll be good for the resume and I don't wanna be here
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.300]   "and it just seems random to us."
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.100]   Or I had a connection through a family friend
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.740]   and Jesus would say, "It may seem random to you,
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.900]   "my God doesn't put lights in random places."
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.420]   And he's placed you very purposefully
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.700]   that you would be the light of your office,
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.140]   that you would be the light of RISD,
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.300]   that school room that you get to go in,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.900]   that you would be the light of every place you go.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.580]   And oftentimes people will come down front
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.380]   and along the conversation of job,
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.300]   people will say something over and over and they'll go,
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.460]   "Man, I just need advice.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.860]   "I'm thinking about leaving my job.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.600]   "I mean, it's really dark."
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.620]   And by dark, they just mean
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.820]   there's not a lot of other Christians there.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.100]   "It's really dark and I just don't know what to do
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.860]   "and my boss, just like the language
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.440]   "and the way that he talks about women,
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.780]   "it just makes me uncomfortable
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.200]   "and they ask me to do things.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.660]   "I'm just thinking about leaving.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.740]   "Maybe I'll go into ministry.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.800]   "I'm thinking this may not be right for me.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.940]   "It's just too dark of a place."
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.180]   God has a light there.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.980]   I mean, that's why you're there.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.900]   In other words, our temptation is look at it
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.780]   and be like, "Man, it's just too dark out here."
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.860]   God has his people there, that's why you're in that job.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.740]   What the body of Christ candidly needs
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.540]   is not everyone to come into full-time ministry.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.780]   It needs more people to go into the darkest places
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.900]   that are out there, more people to go into,
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.800]   to work for AT&T, to become doctors,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.740]   to go into the legal field,
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.460]   to go and to be lights all over those different places.
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.160]   And if you work and you find yourself in a dark environment,
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.660]   you're probably exactly where God wants you to be.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.580]   And he's put his light there.
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.440]   Into the midst of darkness, he's put you.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.740]   You will step into offices tomorrow,
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.500]   you'll step into places tomorrow
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.060]   that candidly I can't get into.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.460]   I mean, God has uniquely given you opportunities
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.000]   to shine and to be a light inside of this.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.780]   I mean, think of it, there's places where I've been to,
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.720]   I don't know if you've traveled internationally.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.700]   I've been to Africa, I spent a summer in Africa.
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.100]   I've been to Brazil, I've been to Haiti,
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.220]   I've been to Mexico, I've been to Europe.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.820]   All of those places I could get into
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.060]   with just enough cash and just a plane ticket.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.160]   I could not get into the school board room
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.420]   that you work at without them being like,
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.140]   all right, someone call security.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.460]   There's someone here.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.240]   I couldn't get into the office that you work at.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.420]   I can't get into the meetings
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.240]   that you're gonna be in tomorrow.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.660]   And God, whether you even believe me or not,
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.260]   which I think it's gonna be really hard for you to,
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.780]   is saying, I've put lights there into that darkness
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.740]   that I hope will shine because I'm a God,
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.100]   our second point, who places people on purpose.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.520]   The remnant is always placed purposefully.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.100]   The remnant, the people of God are always placed purposefully.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:38.220]   I think about, there's a girl that volunteers with us
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.260]   and has served with us for a while,
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.820]   and I called yesterday to make sure
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.660]   the details of this story were correct.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.300]   And really, there's tons of these stories
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.740]   that are like this, but her name is Liz,
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.880]   and Liz was working downtown.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.880]   She had a job, and she had, all of a sudden,
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.800]   a new girl at her job show up named Sierra.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.540]   And Liz was a follower of Jesus.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.780]   She was serving at the port.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.780]   She had recently experienced,
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.340]   like, just Christ came into her life
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.460]   and was changing her life.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.100]   So she's at work, and she's talking about her faith,
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.940]   and one day, she strikes up a conversation
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.720]   with the new girl, Sierra.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.940]   She says, hey, you know, can I tell you
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.380]   a little bit of my story?
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.260]   And goes through her story and invites her
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.020]   to come to the porch, and she says, really?
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.100]   Sierra just kinda gave me, like, the cold shoulder.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.080]   She wasn't interested, didn't wanna have any of it.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.180]   That's not for me.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.720]   And so Liz kinda went about her business,
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.940]   continued to care and initiate and just invite
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.660]   and take an interest to be a light towards Sierra,
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.660]   and really, nothing was happening,
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.500]   or she wouldn't have any of it.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.080]   And Sierra, at that time, was living with her boyfriend,
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.980]   and finally, they kinda go through a broke up,
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.420]   and she just found herself, Sierra,
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.980]   hitting a rock bottom of sorts, if you will,
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.720]   and found herself going, man,
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.580]   everything that I thought was going one direction
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.240]   ended up falling apart.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.220]   And she ended up having a one-night stand,
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.780]   and something about that one-night stand
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.500]   with some dude, just like, God grabbed her heart
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.540]   and was like, I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.140]   And it softened her enough to be like,
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.420]   fine, I'll come with you, Liz, to church.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.980]   You know, I was raised Catholic.
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.900]   I'll go back and see if anything's changed.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.980]   And so she went, and she finally came.
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.860]   She came, she sat in the back here,
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.340]   and she would tell her story, and she'd be like,
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.420]   and I listened to the sermons, and I was like,
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.120]   oh my gosh, this is just terrible.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.980]   They don't even know what they're talking about up here,
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.260]   because she had no, she'd never heard the gospel before.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.220]   It almost sounded too good to be true.
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:29.620]   And Liz kept initiating and taking an interest in Sierra,
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.380]   and after a few more occasions,
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.260]   Sierra came to a place where she's like, I believe that.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.180]   And she trusted in Christ.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.700]   She came to the place where she said,
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.660]   I am trusting that Jesus on the cross died for my sin.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.380]   He paid for everything in my past,
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.780]   everything in my present, everything broken with me.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.460]   And he died in my place, and he rose again.
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.740]   And she came to a place where she trusted in that,
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.740]   and all of a sudden, her life began to change.
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.100]   Kind of moment by moment, day by day, it began to change.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.340]   And not long after that, here's what happened.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.860]   Liz, gosh, I love this story.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.300]   Liz was interviewing for a job,
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.660]   another position at another place, and she got accepted.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.060]   And so she goes to Sierra and just says,
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.340]   man, hey, I got this new job that I'm moving into.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.540]   And the way that she would retell the story would be,
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.300]   man, as I was saying kind of goodbye,
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.700]   we were in the parking lot, and Sierra looked at me,
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.580]   and we both had tears in our eyes,
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.900]   and she just said, man, God had you here for me.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.020]   There's only a handful of months of overlap
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.980]   where you were trying to get out of here and leave this job,
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.460]   and I had just come in,
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.040]   but God had you long enough here on purpose
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.500]   so that I would get to spend eternity with him
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.820]   and get to experience the abundant life with him
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.940]   in this life, that you were here for me.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.300]   Sierra has no idea how true that was,
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.780]   because my God places people on purpose,
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.460]   and the God who's there has placed you on purpose
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.980]   so that you would get to be a light for him.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.060]   And the people around you, if they could use the words,
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.880]   they don't even know it 'cause they're not believers,
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.820]   but if the spirit of God ever gets ahold of them,
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.380]   they may have the same reaction of like,
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.820]   you were here for me.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.580]   You're here for me, your boss, the people underneath you,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.980]   the people that work alongside of you,
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.700]   because God has placed you there purposefully.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.080]   What is convicting just about this idea of a light is,
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:25.020]   man, there's a lot of people who could teach
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.940]   or preach a message on stage right now.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.020]   There's not a lot of people who have the same neighbors
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.980]   that live on either side of them as me.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.060]   Like, at the end of the day,
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.280]   what it looks like for me to be a light
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.340]   is not to preach a sermon.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.040]   Honestly, preaching sermons are way easier
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.980]   than striking up a conversation with somebody about Jesus
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.460]   and trying to do it in a way that is caring and sensitive
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.060]   and just gets to know them
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.540]   or takes advantage of the opportunity,
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.260]   but that's what it looks like for me to be faithful,
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.860]   just like it looks like for you.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.420]   Not to preach some message,
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.820]   but to be a light in the places that God has placed me,
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.120]   just like he's placed you.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.180]   And Jesus continues, and he really points out
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:04.300]   the third idea of what the remnant always is doing
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.860]   and God is doing through them, and he says this.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:13.060]   "In the same way, let your light shine before others,
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.020]   "that they may see your good deeds
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.280]   "and glorify or bring honor,
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.540]   "attribute honor to your Father who's in heaven."
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.100]   That he doesn't say, "Hey, in the same way,
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.260]   "let your light shine so that people
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.380]   "would see your church attendance and be like,
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.540]   "Man, that's awesome, great, good job."
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.060]   So that people would see your actions as a Christ follower
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.060]   and it would lead them to see how your faith
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.460]   is impacting your life.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.340]   That Jesus gives us our third idea from the text,
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.860]   that the remnant always points people to God,
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.220]   not through their church attendance
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.380]   or through the number of Bible verses
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.220]   that they have memorized, but through the way that they act,
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.140]   through their actions, that's what good deeds is.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.700]   That God has placed you and I in the places that we are
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.260]   and he says the way that people are gonna connect
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.940]   with their heavenly Father
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.060]   is not by the church going around into the world
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.700]   and culture and being like, "You need to stop,"
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.900]   and trying to correct their behavior.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.280]   That the role of the church is not for us
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.300]   to go around and correct, it is to go around
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.780]   and try to connect with people
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.480]   and allow our actions to be ones that help them connect
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.900]   with their heavenly Father who is there.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.820]   The remnant always points people to God.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.860]   This is the way that Jesus built his church,
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.380]   through people who live lives that contrast
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.580]   to the world around them.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.720]   You know this?
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.180]   Like this is the way he's always built the church.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.460]   This is the way the future of the church,
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.220]   the church in 10 years that doesn't even exist right now,
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.940]   they're not on the porch on a Tuesday night,
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.440]   they're in a bar somewhere right now.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.080]   The church has always been built
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.820]   through the body of Christ living out their faith,
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.060]   through their actions.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.100]   And those actions end up causing curiosity
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.020]   in the world around us.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.140]   They contrast like light and darkness.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.960]   They contrast the darkness of the world
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.400]   with the light of their actions.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.000]   And it does something like it draws people to God.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.860]   This is the way that God's always built the church.
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.300]   In other words, the way that people typically trust
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.180]   in Christ is by first trusting a Christian.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.200]   If we were to get everyone up here inside of the room,
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.360]   like think about it.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.620]   Like generally speaking, if you were to tell your story,
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.580]   if you're a believer, if you're a follower of Christ,
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.700]   if you ever heard someone tell about kind of their story,
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.560]   it usually involves, hey, and then I met him.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.700]   And he asked me, he was just a friend
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.960]   that was on my sports team.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.380]   He was a friend that I worked with.
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.000]   And he just asked if I had a faith
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.860]   or he took me to his church one day
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.500]   or he invited me to come to this Bible study.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.140]   People, generally speaking, talk about trusting a Christian
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.880]   before they ever trust in Christ.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.020]   Having someone inside of their life
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.340]   that they're willing to go, oh yeah,
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.580]   hey, I'll come with you to that because they trust them.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.580]   The way that God builds his church is through his church.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.700]   The way that God has historically,
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.540]   the way that your life, if you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.500]   has been changed was that at some point
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.820]   there was a follower of Jesus
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.060]   that you intersected paths with.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.140]   And if you were to tell your story,
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.380]   you would say, and then I met her.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.740]   That typically speaking, the way people trust in Christ
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.060]   is by first trusting in a Christian
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.940]   whose actions point people to God,
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.260]   whose actions are a part of inviting them to the God
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.100]   who's extended the invitation to the world around us.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.900]   And this is why I think the actions,
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:23.340]   this is why it is, it's a really dangerous thing
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:27.100]   for people who are not following Jesus
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.180]   to claim to be a Christian.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.180]   Like there's some of you inside of the room
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.220]   that your actions are not pointing people to Jesus.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.220]   They're pointing people to the bar,
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.060]   they're pointing people to the club,
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:37.900]   I don't know what they're pointing to,
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.020]   but they're not pointing to, man,
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.060]   I have this new life inside of Christ.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.780]   You've got one foot in the world, we would say,
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:43.980]   and one foot in the church,
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.100]   and it's making you so you can't enjoy either of them,
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.980]   and you're not good at either of them.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.540]   You've got just enough Jesus to wanna go to heaven,
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.620]   but enough of him to kinda spoil your fun
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.180]   inside of the world, and you, by your actions,
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.660]   are confusing people.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.780]   If you're someone inside of the room who's like,
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.620]   yeah, I'm a Christian,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:02.940]   but it doesn't affect how you date,
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.480]   it doesn't affect how you use your time,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.660]   doesn't affect how you use your money,
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.120]   it doesn't affect the way that you talk,
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:07.960]   the way that you work,
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.340]   it doesn't affect the way that you see the world,
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.780]   I wanna make an ask of you.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.180]   Will you stop telling people you're a Christian?
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.500]   Will you stop telling people you're a follower of Christ
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.080]   if you're not following Jesus?
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.660]   I don't know why that feels scandalous,
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.180]   and I can feel the air go out of the room.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.660]   Did you just say, if I'm not following Jesus,
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.060]   stop telling people I'm not following Jesus?
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.720]   Yes, you're confusing people.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.980]   And you may be going, well, holier than thou art you,
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.620]   so I live with my boyfriend,
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.100]   is it that big of a deal that I'm not following Jesus?
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.960]   Great, say, I'm not following Jesus in this area.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.140]   Maybe just do that.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.720]   That I like to follow him to church on Sunday,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.360]   especially Easter,
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:51.360]   and I, yeah, and so maybe just start there,
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.240]   because you are confusing people.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.360]   And the message of Christianity
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.160]   is not clean yourself up or be perfect,
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.640]   no, it's be open and honest about,
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.120]   like, man, we all have imperfections
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.060]   that God is working through us in our lives.
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:05.900]   But if you're gonna say,
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.200]   I blatantly don't care what God says,
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.080]   stop saying you care what God says.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.680]   You're confusing people,
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.240]   and you are hurting the name of Jesus,
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.000]   and we can golf clap all day long for that,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.920]   and we don't need to,
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.820]   but my point is this, you are hurting the name of Jesus.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.780]   Hey, you're hurting the message of Christianity.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.180]   You're confusing people.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.040]   You're not being a preservative to our world.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.340]   You're not shining light into the darkness.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.240]   And it would be better for you to just say,
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.800]   man, am I gonna be honest and open about,
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.580]   like, am I serious about this Jesus thing or not,
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.260]   and quit playing the games.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.240]   Church is a weird game to play.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.700]   You should go to the lake on Sunday or something,
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.900]   or sleep in and go get mimosas.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.420]   I think they got specials somewhere.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.780]   Like, that's a better use of your Sunday
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.060]   if you're not actually gonna follow Jesus.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.140]   And you're confusing people.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.620]   Tragically, and maybe you're in the room,
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:04.380]   and you have experienced being confused by Christians.
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.840]   And maybe it wasn't even Christians
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.120]   who were kind of, like, giving you this weird,
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.220]   like, yeah, dude, you're buzzed right now at the bar,
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.660]   and you really wanna talk about God,
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.700]   which is a go-to specialty for someone
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.820]   who is one foot in the world and one foot out.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.260]   Maybe it wasn't that person that confused you.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.860]   Maybe it was you grew up in a church
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.700]   that was just full of what so many churches,
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:26.540]   tragically, are, just hypocrisy, judgmentalism, gossip,
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.060]   and you were given a really poor vision
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.320]   of what the church is, is intended to be.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   I was talking to a girl last week while we were in London,
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:42.100]   and she was behind us in this kind of ferry ride.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.900]   We were waiting in line to get on this ferry,
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.500]   and she began speaking, and she was speaking like an American
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.180]   and, in other words, she wasn't like,
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.220]   hello, all right, how is it you today?
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.420]   She was speaking, that's my British accent, thank you.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.940]   I could keep going right now, I'm sorry.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.940]   She wasn't speaking like that,
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:00.980]   she was speaking like an American,
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.180]   and so you're like, oh man, hey, same team.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.960]   And we beat the Redcoats, am I right?
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:13.500]   Where am I going?
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.080]   We started talking to her, and she was there with her mom,
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.120]   and she was like mid-20s,
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.880]   and just kind of a sweet, bubbly personality,
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.080]   and immediately I'm like, dude, she's a follower of Jesus.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.280]   Just kind of like got that sense, I bet she is,
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.000]   and so begin to ask her about her faith.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.500]   She was living in Sweden with her husband at the time,
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.340]   going to school.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.960]   I'm like, for sure, follower of Jesus.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.720]   She's married in her 20s, yeah.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:40.560]   Not a real popular thing to do these days.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.000]   So get married, men, okay?
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.880]   And see, ask her, hey, do you have a faith?
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.360]   And she said, no, I'm really kind of agnostic.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.400]   And we began to talk about why that was,
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.600]   and she said, I grew up in a church in Nebraska,
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.600]   this small town, and everyone was hypocrites.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.520]   It was like the church was so gossipy.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.360]   It was kind of small town.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.880]   Everyone knew, and they would talk about you
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.880]   behind your back, and just kind of like,
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.640]   it wasn't a place, honestly, that I ever want to be a part of
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.300]   and had no interest in being a part of.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.120]   So when I got out of that town, I was like,
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.840]   man, I don't know what God they worship,
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.140]   but that one is not the one that I'm going to,
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:22.220]   because the actions, tragically, did the opposite.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:24.800]   So we got to share with her a minute,
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.520]   and ask her forgiveness that on behalf
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.020]   of the body of Christ, she was given a bad vision,
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.920]   that the body of Christ was not to be a place
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.680]   that allows gossip, it's not to be a place
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.520]   that is full of hypocrites in the sense that they say,
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.180]   you should stop doing that, and then I'm gonna go do it,
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.600]   and claim that it's fine.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.480]   It is the place that's full of broken people
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.020]   who come to the end of themselves and said,
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.080]   man, I don't need, I need a savior.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.400]   I know that the world can tell me I'm a good person,
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.880]   I try to be good, and I pay my taxes,
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.880]   but there's something off in me.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.600]   And I find myself in need of something supernatural
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.520]   to help me, to save me from myself.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.680]   That it's not good people in heaven,
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.440]   and bad people in hell, it's forgiven people in heaven.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.760]   And the only way to get forgiveness
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.480]   is through Jesus Christ, and we just shared that with her,
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.300]   and try to do whatever we can to point her back
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.520]   to that truth, but tragically, it is the church,
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.800]   or people in the name of Christianity,
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.780]   who have done the opposite of what the remnant does,
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.280]   which is point people to God,
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.220]   and they've pointed him away from him.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.600]   But the good news is this, and I'll invite the band
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.740]   to come back up and land the plan here in a second.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:36.840]   God has always preserved a remnant,
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.560]   who know him, who walk with him,
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.000]   and who point others to walk with him,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.600]   in every age, and every time, every place.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.360]   That story I said about going over to London
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.120]   and meeting these different pastors,
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.960]   and how I expected to go in and be like,
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.880]   oh man, you got three people, that's great,
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   keep it up, keep going, this is amazing.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.360]   Dude, God had some surprises for me,
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.520]   and some reminders of how small I can think
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.160]   of his work in our world being.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.120]   Reminders specifically that the God who's there,
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.840]   he's not exclusively at work in America,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.480]   he's not exclusively at work in Dallas,
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.440]   he's not exclusively at work, I knew he's at work,
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.360]   I know he's at work in Africa, and in Asia,
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.680]   where Christianity's exploding.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.160]   There either is, or shortly will be,
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.880]   more Christians in Asia than there are in America,
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.440]   despite the fact that it's outlawed intensely.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.240]   That God is all over, I knew those places,
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.640]   he is, you're seeing explosive growth happening,
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.120]   but inside of the West, I went in thinking,
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.400]   man, there's nothing going on here.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.920]   And as I got to hear from different pastors,
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.680]   there was one from Sweden, think about that,
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.520]   there's one from Sweden, they recently planted a church
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.340]   in the last few years, already in a culture
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.880]   with like 90% agnostic beliefs.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.840]   They've got over 1,000 people coming regularly.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.400]   There was another place inside of East Germany,
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.040]   East Germany is one of the most atheistic places
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.320]   on the planet.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.640]   You may be familiar with the history
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.040]   of kind of the Berlin Wall, remember that,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.440]   and communist East Germany.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.600]   You know what's happening right now,
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.340]   in the most atheist, like truly,
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.800]   I'm not just speaking in superlatives,
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.240]   other than North Korea, which we don't have the stats on,
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.520]   because they're North Korea,
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.880]   the most atheist place on the planet is East Germany.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.280]   Do you know what happens every single year in East Germany?
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   A conference of 12,000 young adults come together.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.440]   Why do they come together?
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.560]   For a prayer conference.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.840]   And they show the video at this thing,
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.680]   and honestly, we do this thing called launch retreat,
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.680]   which is the bomb, and it made launch look like,
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   oh man, we have got to up our game.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.800]   It was unreal, 12,000, 12 times what we see.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.840]   And then they showed us just the church
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.120]   that was hosting kind of this whole event,
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.600]   and it was inside of London itself,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.960]   where 6,000 people every single week come,
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.440]   and they gather on these four different locations.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.920]   They've planted 75 churches, and you know what they said?
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.320]   Our vision, we're gonna see London fall to Jesus again.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.600]   And then they began to talk about,
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.520]   all over just different countries,
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.200]   inside of Europe, and Australia, and Canada.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.560]   There was a Catholic priest who got up,
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.600]   and he talked about God at work inside of Canada,
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.720]   and how thousands and thousands of people
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.760]   are turning to Jesus.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.700]   Honestly, it was like, pfft.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:03.960]   People like you exist?
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.000]   I'm mind blown, because God is at work,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.920]   and the church remains.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.520]   And whatever vision that you may have of like,
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.320]   man, he's just exclusively at work in Dallas,
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.960]   or he's just exclusively in these places,
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.760]   the church remains, and the people of God
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.160]   are all over these places.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.280]   And one of the things that this guy from Germany said
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:23.520]   is we will see the church rise again in Europe.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.280]   And that's our mission, that's what we're committed to,
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.440]   and they're seeing it happen.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.320]   You may not even be hearing of it.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.920]   You may, like me, think, oh wow, that's actually happening.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.080]   It's happening in Australia,
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.400]   it's happening all over our world,
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.240]   because the gates of hell will not stand
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.720]   against the body of Christ.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.720]   And Jesus is alive and at work, and he is on the move.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.200]   And the remnant, the remnant remains.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.840]   What I wanna close with here is just a reminder,
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.600]   if you're inside of the room and you wonder,
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.720]   do I really matter, like am I making a difference?
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.120]   Does it even matter the fact that I work
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.080]   in the job that I'm at?
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.160]   Does it matter the fact that I live
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.080]   in this apartment complex?
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.640]   Does me, when I follow Christ,
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.720]   is it really actually making any significant difference?
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:06.560]   Light always pushes back darkness.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.520]   It always makes a difference in darkness.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.600]   And Billy, what I'm gonna have you do is,
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.720]   if you will shut the lights down,
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.280]   this is just gonna be a visual representation
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.560]   that'll lead us into worship,
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.880]   where I wanna ask you to just do something,
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.880]   if you'll join me, if you believe,
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.960]   just shut lights down.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:23.760]   I wanna just talk briefly about what the Bible says,
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.280]   the picture the world created,
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.120]   or the picture of our world is that it is a world
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.480]   that is full of darkness.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.760]   And into that darkness, Jesus said,
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.080]   I am preserving a people to preserve the world.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.400]   And the remnant will remain,
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.200]   and they will be different colors on their skin.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.760]   There'll be different languages that they speak,
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.840]   but they will all unite around the Messiah,
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.800]   the Savior.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.120]   And the visual image, really,
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:50.960]   if you have a phone right now,
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.800]   I'm gonna invite you to take it,
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.120]   and you can pull it out and just turn on your light.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.880]   From heaven's perspective,
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.600]   this is what the message of Christianity,
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.960]   this is what, if you ever wonder in your life,
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.400]   do I really matter?
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.920]   Do you know what God sees when he looks down,
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.320]   and you look around, you can just see,
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.160]   and this is what heaven's perspective is.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.000]   I want you to think about that.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.360]   That's what Jesus, at the end of the day, says,
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.320]   this is what the body of Christ is
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.840]   in a world full of darkness.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.120]   I've got lights,
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.040]   and the gates of hell won't stand against it,
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.240]   and I'm gonna place them purposefully wherever they are,
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.640]   and here's what you gotta know.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.440]   Every time light enters darkness, it wins.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.280]   Every time.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.720]   And the Savior of the world has said,
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:37.200]   I am placing my people purposefully from my kingdom,
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.460]   where they are, where they live, and where they work,
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.660]   to shine so that others would not see their light,
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.440]   but they would see the God who put them there.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.440]   Let me pray.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.160]   Father, thank you for the reminder
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:54.960]   that you are at work.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.800]   Forgive me.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.900]   Just the ways that, in my own mind,
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.900]   I can assume that something like seeing Europe
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.880]   taken for the name of Jesus is too great of a task.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.760]   Father, would you grow our vision for the church?
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.520]   Would you strengthen the church and our land?
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:16.040]   Father, we pray for hundreds more churches in Dallas, Texas
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.600]   to be formed, to take place,
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.520]   that hundreds of thousands of the five million people
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.320]   that live in DFW would end up stepping into a church,
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.280]   and they would step more so into a relationship
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.120]   with the God who loves them.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.320]   We pray for Houston.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   We pray for Fort Worth.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.280]   We pray for El Paso.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.880]   We pray for Cedar Rapids and Spring and the Woodlands
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.140]   and every place, Tulsa,
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.360]   where the body of Christ is gathered.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.080]   I pray for friends in the room who right now
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.920]   are filled with just a, man,
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.400]   they're not convinced that they're either
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.100]   making a difference.
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.660]   They're not full of hearts that wanna go
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.440]   and to see you take more ground in our land,
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.840]   more ground in the places we work,
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.760]   more ground in our heart.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.760]   Father, would you strengthen,
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.500]   would you fill them with courageous faith?
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.120]   Would you fill my heart with courageous faith?
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.320]   Would you do something amazing in our midst?
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:01.480]   You're the King who makes the darkness tremble,
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   and we worship you now in song, amen.
