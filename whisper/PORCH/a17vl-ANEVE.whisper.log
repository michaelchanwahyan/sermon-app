[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Here lies the old me.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   The kid my parents wanted me to be.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   All the ways the world hurt me.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Goodbye to my fears and anxieties.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   The reason why my ex left me.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Rest in peace to the old me.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   [Music]
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   All right, let's go! 2022!
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Man, you guys.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   2022 looks good on y'all.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Welcome everybody in the room, everybody joining us online
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   to the 14 PortsLive locations.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I want to highlight Ports Indy, Ports Boise, Idaho, Midland, Texas,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Scottsdale, Arizona, Cincinnati, Ohio, Austin, Texas, Fayetteville,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   and all the other locations.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   We're continuing a series called RIP, Rest in Peace to the Old Me.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5, verse 17,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   "If anyone is in Christ, if you have put your trust and faith
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   in what Jesus did on the cross, his death and resurrection,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   you have been made new."
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   You are a new creation, whether you feel like it,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   whether you believe it, God says you are new.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And the Christian journey is now learning to live the new life
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   and who God says that you are currently.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And tonight we're going to explore and dive back in
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   and cover another topic.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   If you missed last week, JD did an awesome job
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   covering RIP to the victim mentality.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   How do I live as a victor, not a victim?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And tonight we're going to cover another message or topic
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   that I think is crucial for you to understand
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   and for me to understand, according to Jesus,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   if we are going to experience the abundant life
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   full of purpose and vitality and that he desires for us.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And so to do that, I'm going to start with a story,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   illustration from kind of the past few days in my life.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   In Dallas, Texas, as everyone in the room knows,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   in the past week we had a snowstorm.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It was 70 degrees and then it was 12 degrees
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   because we're Texas, that's how we roll.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And because of that, there was snow and ice on the ground
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   and I've got kids, I've got a six-year-old, a three-year-old.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Oh, I forgot to tell you all, and we had a baby.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   That's why I haven't been here.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   This is baby bear Michael.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Just cheeks, man, cheeks for days, the best.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And so I took, because it was snowing outside,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I took the six-year-old, my son, and my three-year-old daughter
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and we do what you do when you're six and three
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and there's snow on the ground.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You go attempt to make a snowman.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And this was a challenging feat
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   because most snow is ice on the ground.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So we're trying to pile things together and get it to stick.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   But eventually we got the snowman to work.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And I tell my son, all right, we got the three-ball layer.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   We need to get eyes.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I want you to go inside, ask Mom for Oreos.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   He goes inside, comes back out with raspberries.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I said, Oreos?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   He said, I know, but my favorite color is red.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Can we do red?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And I say, I don't think that's going to go well,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   putting raspberries for the eyes and it's going to melt.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   It's not going to end up looking how you want it to look.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I think we should go Oreos.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   No, Dad, my favorite color is red.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Let's go red.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And so we did raspberry eyes.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And I posted it on Instagram, so you may have seen it,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   but there we are.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Looks like a snowman from a horror movie.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   It's like Olaf meets Blair Witch Project or something.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And I was right.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   That decision took and led to things looking not exactly
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   how he or anyone wanted them to look.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Now tonight I want to talk about a topic and a teaching that
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Jesus is going to paint a picture for us and give us some
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   instructions and say, if you and I don't follow these
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   instructions, it's not going to end up with a life that looks
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   the way you want it to look.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And further, he's going to say, it's not going to end up with an
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   eternity that looks how you want it to look.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I think tonight's message is as crucial for us who live in
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   America, who live in Dallas, who live in Scottsdale,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   who live in the most affluent country that the world has ever
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   known to understand, because Jesus is going to say some
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   really profound things about the danger of a very common belief
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   or a very common goal that a lot of us have,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   specifically called the American dream.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   So tonight we're talking about rest in peace to living for the
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   American dream.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And hello to living for eternity.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Now what do I mean by the American dream?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Now let me get the cards.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I love America.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   You know, I got USA socks.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I'm not wearing them right now, but I would.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I love America.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   This has nothing to do with being anti-America,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   but giving your life to the vision of, man,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   a white picket fence.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I got the house, got the spouse, got the 2.5 kids and a golden
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   retriever, and I can retire early.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   What Jesus would say is a foolish thing to give your life to
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   in light of eternity.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And it is probably the thing that most,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   as much as anything else, we're so inundated because we've only
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   lived in a world where wealth is constantly telling us we don't
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   have enough, we don't have enough.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   So tonight we're going to explore some profound teaching of Jesus
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   that I don't want to be instruction for just your 20s or
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   for your 30s, but to paint a picture,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   or God's going to paint a picture for what to give your life to.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   In other words,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I hope the application buries into your soul and your mind and you
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and your spouse someday spend the rest of your life giving your life
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   to what Jesus says matters.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Rest in peace to the American dream and hello to living for
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   eternity.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   So we're going to look at three reasons why the American dream is a
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   foolish thing to give your life to.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   We're going to start in Luke chapter 12.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Jesus is in the middle of teaching and something happens.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   That's funny as Jesus has been teaching in Luke chapter 12.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   He's in the middle of a sermon.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   That's kind of talking about heaven.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   It's talking about hell and it's talking about acknowledging Jesus and a
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   guy in the crowd begins to speak up and almost heckle Jesus and say,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Hey, Hey, Hey, all that heaven, hell stuff.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   That's great question real quick.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And he begins to ask a question and it's related to the topic of money.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And Jesus uses that to springboard into the dangers of pursuing what
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   today we would describe as the American dream.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   So I'm going to start in verse 13 of Luke chapter 12.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screens.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Also, if you don't have a Bible,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   we have some in the welcome center that are our gift to you.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   You can pick up right after the service.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Verse 13.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Now someone in the crowd said to him, Jesus, teacher,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Jesus replied, man,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Then he said to them, so he takes his comment.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   He's like, what do I have to do with that?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And then he addresses the man and the crowd based on what the manager said,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   watch out and be on guard against all kinds of greed.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Life does not consist in the abundance of possessions,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   which had to sting.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   If you're that guy, it's so savage.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Jesus guy says, Hey, will you tell my brother he didn't share the inheritance.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I want you to come with me, go to the house, tell my brother,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Carl to give me my share of the inheritance.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And Jesus says, let's talk about greed for a second guys.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Is this is a clear example of how we're able to be tempted or fall in the trap
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   of greed.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And then he goes right into a story.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Here's the story.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And he told them this parable, which is another word for story.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   So there's a guy had a farm, had lots of crops that grew.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   He thought to himself, what shall I do?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I don't have any place to store my crops.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Then he said, this is what I'll do.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And there I will store my surplus grain.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And I'll say to myself, this guy talks to himself a lot in the story,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   but I say to myself, you have plenty of grain laid up for many years.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Take life easy, eat, drink, and be married.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Now Jesus stopped the story right there.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   He's talking to an audience that was incredibly poor, first century poverty.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And he's talking to an audience that was also agricultural,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   agragarian, and that the ability to have tons of grain for the rest of your life,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   this was not just the American dream.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   This was the Jerusalem dream.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Times 10.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   We think, man, it would be amazing to be able to stop and to retire.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   People did not retire in this day and age.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So this man has hit the jackpot.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And they're probably thinking as they hear, dude, that is the dream.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Maybe Jesus can tell us how this man was able to accomplish that
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   and how he was able to succeed and make that happen.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And then the story takes a turn.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   "But God said to him, 'You fool, this very night your life will be demanded from you.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   but is not rich towards God.'"
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   So this is a guy, has this big harvest, lots of crops, says to himself,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   you know what, I'm just going to store all this food, make even bigger barns,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   and I'll be able to live for the rest of my life, kick it up, and retire early.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And Jesus says, "And then the man dies.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And all that he had accumulated and gotten for himself and put together for himself
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   was totally lost, and he didn't get to experience the Jerusalem dream
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   or the American dream."
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   He was looking just--all of his accomplishments or really wealth to find security.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And Jesus reminds his audience, there is no security in wealth.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   That comes from one place, God.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   You can have all the money in the world and not live to see or spend any of it.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   The first reason why the American dream is a bad thing to give your life to
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   is because it makes you a fool.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Pursuing or ruling or living out and being ruled by living for the American dream,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   that's the first point, makes you a fool.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Do you know the only time in the Bible where God calls someone a fool is this man?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   I mean, think about that. Why?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Jesus, are you like just against people having things?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   We're just all supposed to be poor to follow Jesus? Is that what he's saying?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   No. He's saying, but if you live for just accumulating and getting the house
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   and getting the car and getting the job and getting the lake house
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   and getting the ability to retire early, you're a fool.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And you have spent your life and wasted it.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And Jesus' point is not anti-stuff.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   He doesn't want the stuff to be the focus and the pursuit of your life.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   This honestly is so convicting because I think in America,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   we're candidly numb to how much we have.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I said earlier, America is the wealthiest country in the history of the world.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   There was a missionary who joined our staff for staff prayer.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   We have a meeting every Tuesday morning for a couple hours, meet together, pray,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   share stories of what God is doing.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   He joined us and he had been gone from the States for 10 years.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And he joined and somebody asked him his first time back in Dallas,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   just kind of on furlough, and they said,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   "What's changed in the last 10 years since you left?"
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And I'll never forget his answer.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   He very quickly said, "Oh, all the storage units."
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And in the audience, we all had the same response like,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   "What is he talking about, storage units?"
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And then I drove around that day and you begin to look for them
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and they're everywhere.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Do you know that the number of storage units--
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   and by that I mean like the facilities where you go and you have so much stuff
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   you can't fit it in your house, so you're like,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   "Honey, we got to rent out a small cube to put some of our stuff in there."
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   The United States has 25 times more of those than all of Europe combined.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   There are more storage unit facilities--I don't mean units like a single box,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I mean facilities, companies, franchises--in the United States
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   than all of McDonald's, Starbucks, Wal-Mart, Walgreens, CVS, and 7-Eleven combined.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   We are inundated with how much stuff.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And Jesus' teaching is there is no amount of stuff that will leave you satisfied.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   You can have all the abundance of possessions,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   but that's not what life is ultimately about.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And our culture tells us that, man, if you just had more,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   if you just had more, if you just had more,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   it would scratch some need, it would leave you fulfilled.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And it tells us that the game of life is kind of like Monopoly.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I mean, at the heart of the American dream is the idea that that game you played
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   growing up, Monopoly, where you try to buy as much stuff as you can,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and the winner at the end is the person who has the most.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   The Bible says that's not true at all.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Jesus is going to tell us that life is a lot more like the game of Uno.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   You guys remember Uno? Your grandma plays Uno?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Most of you probably haven't played because you're not over 85,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   but Uno is this game where the winner is not who has the most cards,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   it's the one who gives or gets rid of the most.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And Jesus is going to say, ultimately, life is not about acquiring and getting more.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   It is about giving more to the only kingdom that will last, which is Christ's.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Don't live your life. Don't be foolish.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And he says this man was a fool because the American dream,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   if it's pursued at the extent of knowing God and making him known,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   it makes you a fool.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And in inverse, living for eternity is the only thing that can make you full on the inside,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   like F-U-L-L.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Living for the American dream makes you a fool.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But living for eternity is not just something that's going to have impact for eternity.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   It fills, it satisfies because you were made for it.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And Jesus looks into the eyes of this man and to his crowd and says,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   "Don't buy the lie that you're here to just acquire and acquire."
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   There's a friend of mine who tells this story about the time his company went public,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   and he became a billionaire overnight.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And he says, "There was a party in this hotel that we were at.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   It just went public. Everyone's downstairs. They're all celebrating.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And I just became a billionaire.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And I went back up to my hotel room, and I started working again.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And I wasn't following Jesus, I just wasn't able to be satisfied
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   because he wasn't following Jesus.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And even turning a billionaire overnight didn't satisfy
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   because there is no amount of wealth, status, success that can, but Jesus can.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And Jesus says, "If you spend your life buying the lie the world around you sells,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   the American dream is what it's all about, you're a fool.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And so am I. But if you spend your life living for eternity, it will make you full on the inside."
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And then he launches in to another challenge that pursuit of the American dream creates.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   He says this, "And then he said to his disciples,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   'I tell you, do not worry about your life.'" He brings up anxiety,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   which is at the heart of, honestly, why a lot of us want to have and get more and have more in the bank.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   "'What you will wear about what you eat or your body, what you will wear.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   For life is more than food and the body more than clothes.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Consider the ravens. They do not sow or reap. They have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Are you not more valuable than God?'" Translation, "God will provide for you."
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   "'Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Do not, since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?'"
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Brings up another illustration, "'Consider the flowers of the field.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   They don't labor or spend, I tell you, not even Solomon in all of his splendor was dressed like one of these.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   If that's how God clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown in the fire,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   how much more will he clothe you? You of little faith.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about it.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   For the pagans," those are people of the world, those are people who do not know God, he's saying,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   "'They run after all those things, and your Father knows you need them.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   But seek his kingdom and these things will be given to you.'"
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   What is Jesus saying? There's so much there, we don't have time to unpack, but he's driving home.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   "'You have a heavenly Father who will provide for you.'
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Chasing the American dream is often fueled by fear of, like, 'I'm going to get more.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   I need to accumulate more. I need to have enough so that I can retire.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   I need to have enough to pay for kids. I need to have enough so that I can get married.'
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And Jesus says, 'Those all are ingrained with the lie that you are the source of provision in your life,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   and that will create anxiety. Living for the American dream makes you anxious.'"
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   This is why the man in the story is driven to go to Jesus and take his one shot with the Son of God
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   and say, "Jesus, the heaven and hell stuff, that's great.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Hey, will you tell my brother to give me some money?" Fear drives us.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Often, fear of not being seen as successful creates an anxiety that,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   "I'm not living up to other people's opinions or the standards or where I should be
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   or where, you know, my friends are in this stage of life."
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And Jesus is saying, "Living for some version of what the world says is success is foolish,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   and it will make you anxious."
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   The second idea is that living for the American dream will make you anxious.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   And Jesus says, "The solution to your anxiety is not more money.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   It is a deeper understanding of who your God is, how he has promised, 'I will provide for you.'
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   I will ultimately provide for you on the cross where I gave my life for your greatest needs.'"
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   That's what Christians believe if you're not a follower of Jesus.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   They don't believe good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   They believe Jesus went through hell for us so that we wouldn't have to.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   He came to earth, died in our place as the payment for our sin,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and then he rose from the dead showing the payment cleared.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   It was more than enough. That's what Christians believe.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And he not only provided there, Jesus says, "And God will provide for your needs."
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Not for the path of success that you want, not for everything that you want in life,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   but he will provide for your needs. You can trust him.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   And if you chase after, "I need to accomplish and succeed and live up to what everybody says," is the goal.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   It's a recipe for being anxious because living for the American dream just creates anxiety.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   As one great poet, Biggie, said, "More money, more problems."
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And we think it's a solution, and Jesus says, "It's not a solution.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   You can have everything that everyone else wants and be miserable."
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   This is a girl named Chelsea Crist.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Chelsea was Miss USA in 2019.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   She was a lawyer who also had her MBA.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   She was a model, D1 athlete at one point in time, incredibly successful, top 10 in Miss Universe,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   was on Extra as a TV correspondent. She was an Emmy nominated.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And 10 days ago, she took her life.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   She's beautiful.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Everything the world would say matters.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Everything you would want, and it didn't satisfy.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It created angst, anxiety, depression.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Because everything the world says matters, you can't fill the part of your soul that was made by God for God.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And pursuing some version of success and what everyone says,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   "This is the goal, and this is the car, and these are the clothes, and this is the way to look,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   this is the number of followers, and this is the house to have."
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   It can't fulfill the part of you that only God can.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And you can either spend your life chasing and striving after that,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   only to arrive at the epitome of what everyone would say is success and find it doesn't.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Or you can look to the one source that can, which is Jesus and a relationship of walking in line with him.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   I've been doing this a long time, and I have seen how chasing the American dream has left young adults empty,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   their families empty. I've sat with young adults in tears who have more money than I will ever have,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   who don't have to work at all, and they, through tears, cry out how money destroyed my family.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And the temptation for us is, you know, we're young adults, you're poor, you're like, "I got college debt."
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   You're like, "You know, I bet we could handle it."
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And the truth is, money is not a solution for your anxiety.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   It's not a solution for the biggest needs and biggest problems that you have.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Money is not a bad thing, but it doesn't offer you what Jesus can,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   which is a solution for that hole that exists in every heart and every person,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   that no amount of status, success, home can ever fulfill.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And he says, "You can trust your Father to provide."
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Living for the American dream makes you anxious.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Living for eternity will give you peace.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   And then Jesus goes into the next portion of the text that tells us what I think is
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   maybe the most tragic portion of this entire thing.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   He says, "Do not be afraid, little flock."
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   It's pretty tender language.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   I mean, you know the scene. He's sitting there in front of this audience.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Man just chimes up from the crowd, and Jesus is like, "Man, let me talk about this,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   because this is going to be a big pitfall for a lot of people.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   They're going to chase and seek something and accumulating or getting stuff.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   It's not going to work."
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And then he ends with, "So don't be afraid.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Sell your possessions and give to the poor.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   A treasure in heaven that will never fail,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   where no thief can come near it and steal, no moth could ever make it destroy.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   He says, "When you begin to live for eternity, something begins to shift in your heart.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And when you live just for this life, something happens,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   and at the end of this life, it will leave you eternally bankrupt.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Perhaps the greatest tragedy of the American dream is it makes you only focus
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   and get so narrow focused on this life and leaves you eternally bankrupt."
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   The third idea from the text we see is living for this life only
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   or living for the American dream leaves you bankrupt.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   He introduces to a topic of I think why Jesus is so passionate about money.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   He says there's a relationship between money and what you treasure and your heart.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Do you know that Jesus, more than anybody else in the Bible, talks about money?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   2,000 verses, he talks about money.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   He talks about it more than he talks about heaven and hell combined.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Why? Because Jesus wants you to be poor and he's against money? No.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Because he knows more than anything else in this life,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   money competes to sit on the throne of your heart,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   to make you feel a sense of control, security, peace,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   can distract you like nothing else or like few other things away from God
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   and build you up and make you think through pride you created what you have.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Jesus isn't against money. He doesn't want your money to have you.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   It's not against you having money.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And nothing like it competes for your heart.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Verses on prayer are 500. There's four times as many verses on money.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Because Jesus knows nothing in this life competes for your heart like wealth.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Which means living in America, the wealthiest country on the planet,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and living in cities like this or in suburbs or in affluent areas like Scottsdale
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   and like Boise and like Dallas and like Austin
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and like all the different locations listening in right now,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   is one of the most dangerous places you can be for your faith.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Because nothing according to Jesus, where your treasure is, your heart will be also.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   In other words, your heart's going to follow wherever your treasure is.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   It's competing for your heart like money.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And we live in a world that is unbelievably inundated in wealth
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   and how much you don't have and what you need.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   There was a friend that was on staff a few years ago. His name was Paul.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And he moved his family to West Dallas.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And if you're listening, that's just a poorer area or higher poverty area of Dallas.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And certainly was at the time, 10 years ago.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And somebody asked him the question. He had kids.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And he said, "Aren't you concerned about it not being that safe?"
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   And he responded with something that I don't think I'll ever forget.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And it was so convicting.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   You think the affluent suburbs are safe?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   You think living in some of the wealthiest areas in the country are safe?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   You think raising kids around all the environments where everyone has a Range Rover
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   and the amount of drugs that they'll introduce, do you think that's safe?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   No.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   It's every bit as dangerous as being in a place that has a higher crime rate.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   It's just a different type of danger. And it may even be worse.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And Jesus would say, "You and I are to be on guard
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   because nothing competes for your heart like money,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   like getting more stuff, like having more,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   more clothes, the right car."
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And it does something to our heart.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And he also gives us an invitation that, "Hey, anything you invest for my kingdom
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   will last for all of eternity."
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   He's not trying to get you away from having nice things.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   He's trying to get you to see life in a right perspective,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   to see your world, to see the opportunity,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   to see your 20s, your 30s, your life in a right perspective.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And it's a focus and refocus how we see.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   There was something called the Hubble Telescope that went into space in 1990.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It was almost $2 billion to create,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   and it basically was the telescope that went up into space.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I think we have a picture of it.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   That allowed us to take images from space.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I mean, it was amazing.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   It's incredible that NASA produced and sent off into space,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and it would allow us to see far distances into the universe
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   and also allow us to capture accurate footage of our world
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and to see it more clearly.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   And they sent it up there, and, you know, tons of anticipation,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   billions of dollars spent.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   It's finally up in the air,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   and they send back the very first images from space,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   from the Hubble Telescope.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   And they get them back, and they're all blurry.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   That's a bad day for somebody at work, man.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Carl!
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   And they realize in order for us to bring it back down here,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   it had not been calibrated rightly on the lenses.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   In order for us to bring it back down, it would be far too expensive.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   In order for us to send another one out, it would be billions of dollars.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   So they came up with a plan.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   We're going to make giant contact lenses
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   that we're going to send up into space,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   and astronauts are going to attach contact lenses
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   onto the outside of the Hubble Telescope.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And it worked.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   And we were able to see in perspective
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   these crystal clear, beautiful images of our planet.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   There's one from the Hubble Telescope
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   where formerly it was out of focus,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   and then those lenses just-- everything came into focus.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   This is what Jesus is attempting to do through his teaching.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   He's not telling them that, hey, you living a life where you have nice things,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   you have a good job, you get out of debt,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   or you have a car and you live in a house someday is bad things.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   What he is saying is you spending your life
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   living for your kingdom, building into your kingdom,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   spending not just your 20s, I mean all of your life,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   investing in acquiring more stuff and having more things
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   and having a life that everyone in the world says is successful
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   is going to leave you eternally bankrupt.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Yet you spending your life investing in my kingdom,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   serving and sharing in my kingdom
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   is going to leave you eternally with treasures that will never fade,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   a reward that cannot be taken from you.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Nothing you invest in this life can be taken.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   And candidly, my fear, because this generation just haven't done this for a while,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   there is a higher level of materialism
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   in young adults today,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   in the church today,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   than just a few years ago there were.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   And I don't know what happened, and I certainly--
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   it's been a challenge for me this week
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   addressing what happened.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Maybe it was social media and the fact that everything everyone wears
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   gets posted everywhere and there's all this pressure to look some certain way.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   And it's like the church all of a sudden shifted from this radical, reckless,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   whatever you want from me, Jesus, take it all.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   I'll give anything and everything. I want to live for your kingdom.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   I'm not living for what other people think
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   and what car that I drive and the house that I have.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   I want to live for you.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   It's like that has shrunk in the hearts of your people.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And not all of them.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   There are men and women who,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   just like that Hubble telescope,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   they see things in perspective.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   They see life. They see our world more clearly.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   And this life more clearly.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   And they're not giving their 20s, they're not giving themselves
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   to living for a kingdom that's going to fade, which is theirs.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Which is any kingdom that is not Jesus.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Think about this man's question
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   and how narrow focus he is.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   I'm about to land the plane.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   He's standing in front of the son of God.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   He's got a shot to talk to Jesus.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Very few people who ever lived got that shot.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Think about how small and petty what he asked for is.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   How much was the inheritance?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Five grand, which would have been enormous in that day and age.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   And he's standing before Jesus, he's like,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   "Jesus, I want you to come with me, come to my house,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   "and I want you to talk to my brother."
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   In the same way, think about how small
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   the perspective of living for the American dream,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   that, "Hey, I'm going to get the car, good, get the car,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   "then what? Then I'm going to get the house, good,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   "you got the house, then what?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   "Oh, I got to have the spouse, okay, you got the spouse,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   "then what? Then we're going to have kids, okay, then what?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   "Then I'm going to have a golden retriever,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   "and then I'm going to retire, then what?"
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   You think that's going to fill anything?
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Are you really going to give your life to something
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   that's going to fade, that doesn't satisfy,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   that story after story after story tells you,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and Jesus, on the planet, says,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   "You are wasting your life."
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Or, are you going to use the gifts God has given you,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   the time God has given you, the finances God has given you,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   the story God has given you, to say,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   "I am going to live for Jesus and my generation.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   "I want to go all in with you, Christ, use my life.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   "Take me and use me as a force in a really dark world for you.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   "I want to make your name great, not my name great."
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And in doing so, Jesus says,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   "Invest in the only kingdom that will last, which is his."
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   In conclusion, living for the American dream
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   leaves you bankrupt eternally.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Living for eternity leaves you rich.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Living for the American dream makes you a fool.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Living for eternity will make you filled and full.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Living for the American dream makes you anxious.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   But living in light of eternity with the God of eternity
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   brings you peace.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   That snowman, because we're in Texas,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   something happens when two days later it's 70 degrees.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   It goes away.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   And all that snow and all that was created, it's gone.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Let me tell you my biggest fear for this room.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   That snowman is a picture for how many people spend their life.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   They work and they build, they create, they mass,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   they get their house, get the job, build the company,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   put it all together.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   And just like the snowman, when the sun comes back, it's gone.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And when the sun comes back, the son of God,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   you will have built a kingdom that will not last,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   invested your life in something Jesus said is foolish.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Not 'cause he's against you having nice things.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   He's against things having you and you giving your life to them.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   And so we rest in peace to the American dream
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   'cause you were made for something far bigger and far greater
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   and are put on this planet for a purpose to know God,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   to make him known, to not waste your life building snowmen
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   that will fade, but to build a kingdom.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   The Bible says it's unshakable, that will last for all of eternity
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   for those who know him.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   And anything they built towards that will last for all of eternity.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Let me pray.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Father, I pray that you would unleash in our generation
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   men and women who serve you and live for you with reckless abandon.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   They wouldn't get caught up and distracted in the temptations
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   of the cities and places and spaces we live in.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Of all the things the world says, this is what success is,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   this is what matters.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And for that to happen, God, we need your help.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Would you take ground in our heart, the places in our heart
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   that run after the things of this world,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   that seek security in things that ultimately can't provide it,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   that find our identity or our worth or find peace in things
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   that are fleeting, and we'd find them in you,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   and we would live radically for you.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Thank you, dear God, who radically gave his life for us
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   so that anyone who trusts in Jesus would spend all of eternity
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   with him in the only kingdom that will last, his.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   We worship you now in song.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Amen.
