1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
 For freedom in the history of our nation

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:11,040
 Dallas and Fort Worth advancing the state of the art in every aspect

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:22,820
 Come on

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,960
 Come on. Come on

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,960
 Hey, listen, if you are hearing me right now

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,880
 If you are hearing me right now either in this room in Fort Worth somewhere around the world

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,040
 It is due to an amazing tech team here locally or wherever you're at another campus or gathering

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,040
 Let's just give it up for our tech guys, man

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:48,560
 We want to see Jesus change the world through the lives of young adults

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,540
 We believe that he's doing that and we are watching a movement continue to grow outside the walls of Dallas Fort Worth

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,080
 And so tonight we have a gathering that's kicking off in El Paso, Texas

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,480
 We have one in spring, Texas, Tulsa, Oklahoma

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,920
 The woodlands our friends in Houston, Texas

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,800
 We love you, and I cannot forget our dear dear friends our partners in ministry in Fort Worth, Texas Garrett Rayburn

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,160
 Thank you for your leadership there

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,040
 We love you guys is so fun to gather in the name of Jesus and worship and sing

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,240
 Love songs to a God who created us and to look at his words and say hey, what do you have for me?

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,040
 What do you want to do with my life?

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,720
 and so

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,640
 Man, it was a great break

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,180
 I hope you had a great break and I'll just start by telling you a little bit about our family any any dog people here

22
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,560
 All right, all right any cat people here

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,760
 Okay, we're just gonna have a moment to pray for the cat people, okay

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,640
 No, I'm kidding our family. We're we're bird people

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,100
 Okay, if we are friends online or something, you know, we're a bird family

26
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,600
 And so my nine-year-old has a parakeet named turquoise. All right, we haven't graduated to parrot yet

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,800
 We got a parakeet named turquoise. She loves turquoise what that looks like is she comes down

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,120
 Every morning gets turquoise out of his cage and she has breakfast with turquoise

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,600
 Okay, that's our parakeet and her parakeet specifically and and turquoise will fly around the house, but not for long

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,240
 It's really interesting when she gets turquoise out of the cage no matter where she takes him

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,520
 He will fly back to his cage. Okay, and it's a complicated flight path

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,840
 you got to go around the refrigerator down a hallway and turn into the utility room and then kind of

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,320
 Swing a tight left and then stop and and he's nailed it like he's got that down. He loves his cage

34
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,140
 He loves his cage. And and so as soon as Presley gets him out

35
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,040
 He will be back to the cage and you know, I can't blame him because we're good cage keepers, right?

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,440
 We've got toys in there for him. We change the food and water daily

37
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,400
 We change the bedding weekly and and we've even bought him a friend a white parakeet named icing

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,760
 okay, and so we have set turquoise up and and

39
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,580
 Presley Presley took turquoise outside one day

40
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,320
 Big mistake and mama was like Presley. What are you doing? You can't just take him outside

41
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,080
 He's gonna he's gonna fly off and I mean as soon as she said the words fly off turquoise was gone

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,960
 I mean, bye-bye birdie like I'm talking straight through to the horizon over the houses

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,880
 Just gone like just just off like back to the Amazon or wherever parakeets come from

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,880
 I mean this bird was gone and and you laugh but it was really sad because Presley sitting there

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,040
 I mean her eyes start welling up with tears and she's like mommy mommy. What do I do? Mommy?

46
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,560
 What do I do then? My wife's like, oh get in the car, you know

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,920
 And so they get in the car and they start driving around North Dallas looking for a parakeet

48
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,520
 Okay, and and and so they're gone and and I'm not there Monica calls me

49
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,800
 Will you just pray and she tells me you know, Presley's just torn up over it Presley literally prays his prayers

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,440
 Like just tears rolling down her cheeks God

51
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,120
 I just pray that if you don't let me find turquoise that you would give him a friend to protect him because he's not a

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
 survivor and

53
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,440
 And I'm thinking she's right he's not a survivor we've baby this bird, you know

54
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,840
 And so they drive around for a long time looking for turquoise and then they eventually give up they come back to the house

55
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,000
 And I mean when they come near the house Presley sees this like turquoise blur on the horizon

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,520
 I'm talking like four houses over and she says mommy. I saw turquoise and Monica's like, oh, you know, sweetie. It's gonna be okay

57
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,280
 You know

58
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,280
 Turquoise is free now, you know

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,980
 And and and press is like no mommy. I saw him

60
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,600
 I saw him just drive this way and they drive down the alley

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,680
 Behind our house and right on the other side of our fence there in the grass is turquoise

62
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,620
 He came back

63
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,360
 He came back

64
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
 Yeah, yeah

65
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,620
 And I know why he came back. I know why he came back

66
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,760
 Because turquoise would rather be in captivity

67
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:25,320
 To a person who loves and cares for him and provides for him than what the others might think of freedom

68
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,680
 Where he may be devoured

69
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,000
 And I want you to know here tonight that some people you you have to

70
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,800
 Understand that if you want freedom real freedom comes from full submission to a master who loves you

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,000
 It's the only place you're gonna find freedom. You're not gonna find freedom anywhere else

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,520
 But to a master to a God who created you and loves you and has a plan and a purpose for your life

73
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:02,180
 So in your pursuit of freedom you remember about that provider you remember about that protector you remember about that

74
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,640
 God who loves you and that's why I do this. That's why I'm here tonight

75
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:12,960
 That's why my wife's gonna tuck my kids in this evening alone because I'm just crazy enough to believe that if the Holy Spirit would speak

76
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,620
 Through us up here and inspire you and capture the hearts of some young adults man. We can change the world and we're watching God

77
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,840
 Do it right before our eyes. We're seeing him do it. I

78
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,700
 Will tell you there's nothing revolutionary about birds that fly away

79
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
 But birds that come back

80
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,800
 And say hey, I belong to a master who loves me and has a plan and a purpose for my life

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,400
 Who's gonna care for me and provide for me and protect me?

82
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,880
 And so I will fully and willingly submit my life to his care. That's a revolutionary act

83
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,640
 That indeed is revolutionary. And so we're starting a new series this evening called New Year

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,280
 revolution not New Year

85
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,480
 Resolution because resolutions may change you

86
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,680
 revolutions change the world resolutions might make a better you for a moment, but

87
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,200
 Revolutions that's you stepping into the greatest revolution. The world has ever seen

88
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,360
 revolutions change the world and I will tell you that

89
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,880
 Revolutions have all started with one thing in common. It is indeed the pursuit of freedom

90
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,120
 Okay, whether it's the American Revolution that that sought freedom from Britain

91
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,480
 Whether it's the French Revolution that sought freedom from an absolute monarchy or even cultural

92
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,760
 revolutions like the sexual revolution of the 60s that sought freedom that said I want to be able to have sex with whoever I want

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,000
 whenever I

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,160
 want it is indeed the pursuit of freedom and

95
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,920
 That may be something that we all

96
00:07:51,960 --> 00:08:00,040
 desire this evening, but that is the great paradox of the Christian faith that victory comes through free through surrender and freedom through

97
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,720
 Submission that real freedom comes into stepping

98
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,520
 Into this revolution and so I will tell you friends

99
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,520
 That when I

100
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,040
 Pursued freedom and anything else

101
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,800
 It has led to a tragic captivity

102
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,320
 Like when I pursued freedom and sex outside of marriage

103
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:30,720
 It ultimately landed me in a toxic relationship that I couldn't shake loose. I was stuck in

104
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,760
 life full of shame and guilt when I pursued freedom in

105
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,040
 pornography I

106
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:46,880
 Became a slave to pornography not able to walk away from pornography stuck in pornography when I pursued

107
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,040
 freedom in the party

108
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,640
 And in in getting drunk then all of a sudden I didn't know how to have fun without it. I was a slave to

109
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,320
 Alcohol to the drink to the party see sometimes

110
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:08,160
 The things that we pursue freedom in make us its slave and it's not pretty

111
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,280
 And no one here is free

112
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,040
 We're all followers

113
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,760
 We're all following

114
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,280
 something

115
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
 either culture or Christ

116
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,080
 money or the Messiah a

117
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,840
 Relationship or the righteous one the crowd or the cross right? We're all following

118
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,400
 something

119
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,080
 So the way that you join the greatest revolution the world has ever known

120
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,600
 It's by choosing the right leader following the right leader

121
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,440
 That's what I want to talk to you for for just the next few minutes. Is that freedom comes from following?

122
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,560
 freedom

123
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,480
 Comes from following and if I told you tonight I said hey I can make you free I

124
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:56,320
 Can set you free? I can I have oh, I have freedom to offer you that may not be that compelling

125
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,000
 You may be like what JP I walked in I drove here on my own. I walked in on my own. I'm free

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,240
 I don't know what you really mean, but if I start personalizing and I look you in the eyes and I say say

127
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,840
 Christ offers you freedom from anxiety

128
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,760
 Freedom from the need for approval freedom from the fear of man freedom from the love of money freedom from materialism

129
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:26,800
 Freedom from the need to be liked freedom from depression freedom from cutting freedom from sadness freedom from loneliness freedom from false hopes

130
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,280
 Then all of a sudden you might lean in and be like, okay, I want this freedom

131
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:40,380
 Jesus offers you that freedom right now. It is available to you in a life that is following him

132
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,900
 and

133
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,660
 so from John chapter 10

134
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,700
 I'm going to teach where freedom is not found where full life is found and

135
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,260
 Where forgiveness is found?

136
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:00,380
 Verse 1 very truly I tell you Pharisees Jesus talking to the Pharisees anyone who does not enter the sheep

137
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,780
 Pin by the gate but climbs out

138
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:09,020
 By some other way is a thief and a robber the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep

139
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,860
 And so there's a shepherd there sheep

140
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,380
 There's a pin

141
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:19,180
 captivity and then there's one that seeks to destroy the sheep the gatekeeper opens the gate for him and the sheep

142
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,700
 Listen to his voice

143
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,980
 He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out when he has brought all when he has brought out all his own

144
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,500
 He goes on ahead of them and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. Do you know Christ's voice?

145
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,380
 But they will never follow a stranger. No, they're not gonna fall for futile temptation

146
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,060
 In fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize the strangers voice

147
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,140
 Jesus used this as a figure of speech it says but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them

148
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,540
 Therefore Jesus said again very truly

149
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,700
 I tell you I am the gate for the sheep all who have come before me of thieves and robbers

150
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,740
 But the sheep have not listened to them. I am the gate whoever enters through me will be saved

151
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,340
 They will come in and go out and find pasture the thief only

152
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,060
 comes to steal and kill and destroy

153
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:16,220
 This metaphor that Jesus is using came alive for me when I stood at the very place where this revolution started

154
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,860
 I was there in Israel

155
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,460
 specifically at the place where the nativity is

156
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:27,500
 Traditionally known to have curd and where Jesus was born of Mary and I'm looking out and I see the Shepherd's field and in the Shepherd's

157
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:27,700
 field

158
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,140
 I see a pin a sheep pin and the in the guide begins to explain it to us

159
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:39,540
 How how hundreds of sheep would go into that pin and they would belong to several different shepherds and in this Eastern culture

160
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,700
 Shepherds were so loving to the sheep

161
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,420
 They were like a part of their family that they could go up and they could call out their sheep by name

162
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,620
 They could just make a sound their voice was familiar to them and out of the hundreds of sheep

163
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,940
 They're the 15 sheep that belonged to that shepherd would come out

164
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,260
 and

165
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:04,020
 And the shepherd there in the hills in the distance where the predators looked on they wouldn't come near the sheep if the shepherd was

166
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:09,300
 There sheep there a defenseless animal that's yours in my role. We cannot survive without a shepherd

167
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,180
 Sheep have no hope without a shepherd

168
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,780
 They are under the care for the shepherd during the day the shepherd would open that gate and let the sheep graze in pasture if it

169
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,300
 wanted to or sit in the protection of the pin if it preferred and

170
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,620
 At night the shepherd would lay his own body down in that gap

171
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,540
 so that anything that wanted to enter that pin would have to crawl over him as

172
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:39,180
 He protected the sheep and then there was this truth that I thought was really interesting in Western culture

173
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,020
 Shepherds drive the sheep they get behind them and they push them forward

174
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,860
 They throw rocks at them and hit them with a rod but in Eastern culture

175
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,620
 They love the sheep and the sheep follow them. They walk in front of the sheep and the sheep follow the shepherd

176
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,500
 that's the culture that Jesus spoke these words to

177
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:05,740
 And so my first point this evening as we're talking about who will you follow is that true freedom cannot be found in following?

178
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,580
 Anything else not anyone else not anything else the thief

179
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,900
 This says comes only to still kill and destroy and so there are people who desire

180
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,780
 To lead you out of right relationship with Jesus things stuff status marketing arms

181
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:27,860
 hurts habits hang-ups that seek to lead you out of right relationship with Jesus and

182
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,460
 The way that they do this is they tempt you with things that you desire

183
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,180
 Things that your flesh desires they do not tempt you with things that you don't want

184
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,580
 They're not dangling Brussels sprouts in front of you saying hey, come here, you know

185
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,580
 They use a lure

186
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,580
 The enemy Satan he's real he hates you

187
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,500
 He hates your unborn children. He hates your spouse. He hates the idea of marriage

188
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,820
 He hates your faith

189
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,640
 Your relationship with Jesus he hates it

190
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,740
 So he uses a lure to lure you away a lure is like a fishing term

191
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,780
 There's hundreds of thousands of different fishing lures

192
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:15,060
 some have bright colors some move in particular ways some make noises some have a scent and

193
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:22,740
 They lure the fish away so that the fish wants the lure and when it takes the lure then they they take the fish

194
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,820
 out of where it belongs and

195
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,260
 the best lures

196
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,040
 Look like the real thing. That's why the enemy uses things that look like counterfeit abundant life

197
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,020
 Things that look like what God would want for you temporary counterfeit pleasures

198
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:43,440
 That's what Satan puts in front of you to pull you out of right relationship with

199
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,260
 Jesus right culture is not going to lead you into the right revolution

200
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:55,000
 You may need to die to this dream of being the cool Christian

201
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,840
 You may not be able to be a cool Christian may have to be a weird Christian

202
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,240
 You might have to dare I say be a stranger and an alien kind of Christian

203
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,420
 One that doesn't belong to this world kind of Christian

204
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:18,820
 One that marches in a different direction kind of Christian like don't we see that the enemy uses counterfeit lures like like

205
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:24,760
 Pornography, can you think of any other kind of greater counterfeit sex? It's sex with a two-dimensional

206
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,860
 Picture a computer screen. It's counterfeit sex outside of marriage. That ain't real sex

207
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,500
 Or maybe it's just sex

208
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,720
 But it's not the love that God created us to have an experience

209
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,180
 In fact, it may rob you of that kind of love it may make that

210
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:52,900
 Farther in the distance for you out of reach loving things that rust

211
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,560
 Counterfeit

212
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,240
 And so here's why I tell you all of this is because none of you said

213
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,380
 2017 I resolved to be a mediocre Christian

214
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,280
 At the end of this year. I hope I'm really lukewarm me and Jesus that we have some kind of relationship

215
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,800
 Every now and then I'll talk to him

216
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:24,520
 No, none of you said that but some of you will have that not because you wanted that but because you wanted Jesus and a

217
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,080
 lot of other things

218
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:33,160
 Because you wanted Jesus in a relationship Jesus and stuff Jesus and status Jesus and pleasure that that in the temporary

219
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,640
 Sense not the real kind but the counterfeit sense and so you finish this year

220
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,160
 Having something

221
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,800
 very

222
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,640
 unrevolutionary very

223
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,140
 Mediocre and he has something better for you

224
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,500
 Like let me just take an example because we talk about porn and sex a lot

225
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,560
 So I'm gonna go with a different one right now. I'm gonna go with alcohol

226
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
 I'm gonna go with a party if you will

227
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,200
 Right, and so we say hey, I want Jesus and I want the party. I

228
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,920
 Choose them both

229
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:13,920
 Proverbs 23 verses 29 through 32 says this who has woe who has sorrow who has strife who has

230
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:20,360
 Complaints who has needless bruises from the bar fight who has bloodshot eyes from the hangover

231
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,040
 depression

232
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
 Sadness, what did we do last night?

233
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:32,520
 Those who linger over wine who go to sample bowls of mixed wine where it says bowls of mixed wine think

234
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,760
 shots of Jaeger think

235
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,680
 Margarita bowl of wine was like the margarita of the day the mambo taxi or something

236
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,820
 Do not gaze at wine when it's red when it sparkles in the cup when it goes down smoothly in the end

237
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
 It bites you. Do you see the lure?

238
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,920
 Do not look at that

239
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,840
 organ of

240
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
 liquor behind the bar

241
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,200
 and

242
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,040
 the $60 $120 bar tab

243
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,720
 In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper

244
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,640
 And after all the pain and the hangover you wake up and it says I love it ends written thousands of years ago

245
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,960
 Give me another drink like a dog to his vomit

246
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,960
 Let me return to that which is destroying my life

247
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,540
 And I can't even see it because I'm thinking that's where life is that I would sit at the bar with a friend and say

248
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,640
 Man one day we're gonna backpack through Europe, bro

249
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
 One day we're gonna do it

250
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,800
 Man one day I've got all these dreams and hopes and let's just talk about I love you, man

251
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,920
 Sin robs you of creativity. You're not gonna backpack through Europe. You're gonna backpack back to the bar

252
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,840
 Back to the club doing the same thing over and over and over and call it life and it's stupid

253
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,440
 It's not life

254
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,000
 It's cultures revolution

255
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I

256
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,560
 Saying you can't drink

257
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:06,240
 I'm saying too many of us have drank under this idea that well Jesus drank and the truth is we love

258
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,560
 The drink more than we love Jesus

259
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:16,440
 We love the party more than we love Jesus we've been lured away and we don't even know it my buddy was playing volleyball and

260
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,200
 Public courts and

261
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,200
 There it was him and some some of his community group and this band of brothers comes up

262
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,680
 they're all wasted like completely gone and and

263
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,320
 And they say hey you want to play my friends like sure

264
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,560
 I think we can take you guys and they're like swinging and missing the ball and every other words the f-word and and

265
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,360
 At the end of it all after my friend won

266
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,140
 because that's what Christians do and and so

267
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,480
 He gathered him up to share the gospel and said yeah

268
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,440
 I go to this church called watermark and one of the guys goes water the other guys. They would see watermark. I

269
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,760
 Go to the ports. I effin love the ports. I'm there every effin Tuesday, and he's not talking about the restaurant

270
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,280
 And I love that that guy's here man, I

271
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,480
 Love it

272
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,760
 But I don't want him to think that he's following Jesus

273
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:15,120
 And did I just say he's not following Jesus cuz he's drunk and he's cussing. Yeah, that's what I said

274
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
 He's not following Jesus

275
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,000
 Am I saying he's not saving that's between him and God, I don't know God lets him in

276
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,440
 I don't know where he did with salvation

277
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,400
 I'm saying the brothers not following Jesus and if that's you you don't dare think that you're following Jesus

278
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,120
 You're not following Jesus. You've given your life to some other God you're worshipping some other God

279
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,600
 That ain't following Jesus

280
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,000
 You're not saying hey Christ take my life make it thine here. I am I want to follow you

281
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,800
 Back into that cage. No back into the bar back into the club

282
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,520
 Call myself a Christian be cool Christian evangelism in it. Would you not?

283
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,360
 You're wrapped up in another revolution

284
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,680
 That's the wrong revolution, bro

285
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:10,480
 Nothing revolutionary about that the guy sharing the gospel on the volleyball court. That's revolutionary

286
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,000
 That's countercultural

287
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
 That's crazy

288
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:24,040
 Man you like oh man another pastor just tell me stop having sex stop getting drunk and maybe we don't know each other. I

289
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:33,400
 Remember thinking there was life there. I remember going home with strangers waking up with hangovers. I

290
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,920
 Remember having such a problem that it landed me behind bars

291
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,600
 Hanging with the wrong people that you you think I don't know how to party I I've partied

292
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,080
 I've just found a better party. I

293
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,600
 Found a better leader man

294
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,240
 Jesus he wants you to know him

295
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,240
 You would hear his voice

296
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,400
 The times I've heard the Lord speak to me

297
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,560
 It's been when I've been spending time with God

298
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,200
 in his word

299
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
 listening extended periods of time

300
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,880
 And he speaks and he directs me because it's that familiarity

301
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:20,280
 If you don't have that don't expect to hear God don't expect his voice to be familiar to him

302
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,920
 You're gonna hear the one that seeks to steal kill and destroy

303
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,440
 He says I've come so that they might have life and

304
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,880
 Have it to the full I've come so that they may have life and have it to the full

305
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:40,400
 Freedom is life to the fullest my second point this evening is life to the fullest is found in following Jesus

306
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,040
 What does a abundant life mean?

307
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:51,000
 What does that mean like I asked a group of people that today like could you describe the abundant life that Christ came to give

308
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,680
 You do you understand you have a grip on what it means life to the full. What does that really mean?

309
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,200
 I asked a friend today who was who was has been a Christian since she was little bitty

310
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,880
 Faithfully followed God never a wonder not in high school not in college. And and here's what I asked

311
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,400
 I said, I want you to convince me that your childhood was better than mine

312
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,560
 And without hesitation, I'll give you a couple sound bites

313
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,380
 She said I laughed more and I laughed harder and I don't have the scars you do

314
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,560
 I'm like man, you could have said that a little softer. Okay

315
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:35,320
 Okay, you know I laughed more and I laughed harder and I don't have the scars you do and she's right

316
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
 Abundant life

317
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,240
 Jesus offers life to the full. I wouldn't believe it had I not experienced it. I

318
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,840
 Stumbled into a church hungover. I sat in the back row. It was this church heard the gospel

319
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,720
 Surrendered my life to Christ, but I was still kind of seeking I was a baby believer and

320
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,240
 Some guys here invited me to a lake house

321
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,480
 And I'd been to a lake house. I've been to lake parties, you know, so I'm like man

322
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,600
 I wonder what Christians do with a lake house, you know, I didn't know what to do

323
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,960
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

324
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,840
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

325
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,560
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

326
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,680
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

327
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,080
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

328
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

329
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

330
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

331
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

332
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

333
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

334
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

335
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

336
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

337
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

338
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
 I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

339
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,320
 "Hey, let's talk about how we can change the world."

340
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,140
 I'm like, "Really?

341
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,980
 You think you can change the world?"

342
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,820
 "Yeah, I think we can."

343
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,640
 "Okay, let me tell you how we're doing it."

344
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,480
 I'm like, "What, dude?

345
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,320
 Y'all are changing the world?

346
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,440
 How did I change the world?"

347
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,480
 It was like real conversations.

348
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,920
 And I'm like, my heart's racing.

349
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,320
 True story, I got in bed that night at that lake house

350
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,620
 and I couldn't sleep.

351
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,840
 My heart was racing so fast

352
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,520
 from whatever I had just experienced.

353
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,040
 It was just confusing to me.

354
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,560
 And so I got out of bed the next day.

355
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,720
 I had not slept one single wink.

356
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,000
 And I called my best friend back in Dallas.

357
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,640
 And he woke up groggy, hungover from the night before.

358
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,440
 And I'm like, "Bro, we've been missing it.

359
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,240
 These Christians know how to party."

360
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,120
 He's like, "Really?

361
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,440
 What'd you do?

362
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,240
 Were there kegs there?"

363
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,040
 I'm like, "No, dude, you don't understand.

364
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,280
 It's like a whole 'nother level of party.

365
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,640
 It's like I don't feel guilty.

366
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,360
 I'm not worried about anything.

367
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,680
 I don't feel anxious at all.

368
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,240
 Like I just have this deep, deep sense of peace

369
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,520
 inside of me.

370
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,120
 And like whatever I did last night,

371
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,280
 I wanna do again today.

372
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,480
 And it's like readily available to me."

373
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,240
 Come so that they might have life

374
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,820
 and have it to the fullest.

375
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,040
 Man, some of you guys, you get this.

376
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,520
 I see the changes in your life.

377
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,440
 I watch you on Instagram

378
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,840
 and I just see your lives change, your feed change.

379
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,600
 And like one of our leaders got married this past weekend

380
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,760
 and it was so cool to see like who was there.

381
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,640
 'Cause like all the bridesmaids and all the groomsmen

382
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,720
 were people they had met at the porch.

383
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,160
 Their lives had just been radically made over.

384
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,600
 And I'm like, it's just a picture of abundant life.

385
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,480
 One aspect of it.

386
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,800
 That's why we say so often,

387
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,840
 change your playmates in your playground.

388
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,940
 But it starts with changing who's in charge of your life,

389
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,960
 who you're following.

390
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,480
 Jesus says, verse 11, "I am the good shepherd.

391
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,400
 The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

392
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,080
 The hired hand is not the shepherd.

393
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,320
 Does not own the sheep.

394
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,840
 So when he sees the wolf coming,

395
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,720
 he abandons the sheep and runs away.

396
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,220
 Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.

397
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,700
 The man runs away because he is a hired hand

398
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,600
 and cares nothing for the sheep.

399
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,800
 I am the good shepherd.

400
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,160
 I know my sheep and my sheep know me.

401
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,720
 Just as the father knows me and I know the father

402
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,800
 and I lay down my life for the sheep."

403
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,600
 He lays his life down for us.

404
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,280
 That's how he forgave us.

405
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,960
 And talking about freedom,

406
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,740
 true freedom starts with forgiveness.

407
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,520
 My third and final point is forgiveness

408
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,760
 is found in following Jesus.

409
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,520
 Some of you need this point really bad.

410
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,360
 You need to know right now,

411
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,440
 everything you've done, the thing you did last night,

412
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,200
 it can be wiped clean.

413
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,840
 Forgiveness is found in following Jesus.

414
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,040
 Jesus is committed to forgiving you.

415
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,020
 It's a commitment that he signed in blood with his life.

416
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,520
 He's saying something really key here.

417
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,920
 He's saying, "Hey, someone employed to watch the sheep,

418
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,620
 they're not gonna die for the sheep.

419
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,360
 They're not his sheep."

420
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,500
 Fair weather friends, your drinking buddy,

421
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,280
 dude, cancer hits, trials hit, layoffs hit,

422
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,680
 those dude are peace out.

423
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,340
 Hey man, good luck with that.

424
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,520
 I'll pray for you.

425
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,640
 But this one man, he's not going anywhere.

426
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,000
 He's like, "I laid my life down for that sheep.

427
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,920
 I'm gonna be right there with that sheep.

428
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,560
 I'm gonna run and find that sheep.

429
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,320
 I love that sheep.

430
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,160
 That's my sheep."

431
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,600
 We belong to Jesus.

432
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,920
 We belong to him.

433
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,060
 We're his.

434
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,000
 We belong to him.

435
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,760
 Take a deep breath and say that to yourself.

436
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,900
 We belong to him.

437
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,160
 So you remember that when you're questioning his love for you

438
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,080
 that you belong to him and he loves you and you are his.

439
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,320
 And Romans tells us that nothing can separate

440
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,280
 neither height nor depth, nor rulers or principalities,

441
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,840
 nor angels or demons, nothing in all the earth

442
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,400
 can separate us from the love of God.

443
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,080
 And so you're asking yourself right now,

444
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,220
 "Well, what if I do JP?

445
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,180
 What if I said, what if I love that boy more than Jesus?

446
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,000
 What if I go back to that relationship?

447
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 What if I tonight go on my computer or back on my phone

448
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,800
 and I look at those things and you talk about drinking

449
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,080
 and this weekend, man, it's the bachelor party,

450
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,840
 you know, and what am I gonna do?

451
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,480
 What if I wander away?"

452
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,280
 You think you're gonna outrun God, huh?

453
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,580
 You think you're faster than him?

454
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,220
 You remember Luke 15, what he does

455
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,120
 when one sheep falls in the pit?

456
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,360
 He leaves the 99 and he goes after him.

457
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,480
 He's gonna find you and he's gonna get you.

458
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,860
 He's gonna take you back.

459
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,040
 That's the truth.

460
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,480
 So you're not gonna outrun his grace.

461
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,580
 It's faster than you.

462
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,800
 And so does that mean that you should go

463
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,360
 to the bachelor party just in case

464
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,440
 you need a prophetic moment?

465
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,880
 No. (laughs)

466
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,860
 No.

467
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
 You want me just to not go?

468
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,760
 Yes.

469
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,400
 Yes.

470
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,800
 We were in Disneyland.

471
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,320
 Over the break, I had an opportunity to camp out there

472
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,120
 and opportunity to share the gospel with some friends,

473
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,500
 talk through scriptures with some friends

474
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,360
 and got to take my family with me

475
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,900
 and so took my kids to Disneyland.

476
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,360
 It was really, it was a great time

477
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,360
 and we were there in line,

478
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,000
 kind of walked from a food place to a ride

479
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,880
 and I turned around and my seven-year-old,

480
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,080
 it was on her birthday actually,

481
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,640
 she was turning eight and she wandered off.

482
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,360
 And I didn't, and she's kind of,

483
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,080
 she's the middle, kind of dramatic one

484
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,560
 and I thought, oh no, oh no.

485
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,720
 And here's what I didn't do.

486
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,680
 I didn't be like, hey babe, Finley's gone.

487
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,880
 Let's go ahead and ride this ride

488
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,280
 and then we'll look for her.

489
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,800
 (congregation laughs)

490
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,280
 No, I mean, we got a fast pass and all that.

491
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,800
 We better, let's go ahead and knock this out

492
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,280
 and then we'll find, it's a bit,

493
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,880
 she's got fences and stuff, she's not going anywhere.

494
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,120
 (congregation laughs)

495
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,800
 Man, let's eat this, let's finish this hot dog.

496
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,920
 Let's go get some, I'm kind of hungry,

497
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,560
 let's get some food and then we'll find Finley.

498
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,120
 That's not what I did.

499
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,640
 So babe, Finley's gone, let's find her.

500
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,600
 And I looked everywhere.

501
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,280
 I mean, instantly, like looking around,

502
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,840
 scramble, that kind of, you know, where is Finley?

503
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,480
 And I knew it wasn't gonna be good when I found her

504
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,880
 and there she was, like in a crowd full of people.

505
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,760
 (screams)

506
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,600
 Just screaming like her head off,

507
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,280
 like the hyperventilate, like can't breathe kind of cry

508
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,880
 and I'm like, okay, everybody get back, she's mine.

509
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,640
 (congregation laughs)

510
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,480
 And she bites.

511
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,240
 (congregation laughs)

512
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,920
 And I didn't say, how dare you, Finley?

513
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,940
 What the heck were you thinking?

514
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,720
 You're gonna wander off from me, huh?

515
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,320
 Teach you to wander off.

516
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,640
 (congregation laughs)

517
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,240
 I didn't do that, it's not what a loving dad does.

518
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,920
 I grabbed her and I held her and I rocked her

519
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,080
 and I patted her.

520
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,740
 I whispered in her ear, I love you, baby girl.

521
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,740
 Hey, I'm never going to leave you nor forsake you.

522
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,040
 If you leave me, I will find you.

523
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,240
 If someone takes you, I will find you.

524
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,720
 I will go Liam Neeson on them so fast.

525
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,560
 (congregation laughs)

526
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,720
 It's gonna be crazy, like they better know something.

527
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,680
 I will find you and that's what he's saying.

528
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,720
 He's like, don't you get, I laid my life down for you, man.

529
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,520
 You think I'm gonna die for you and then be like,

530
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,960
 oh, well, they looked at porn again.

531
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,800
 That's it.

532
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,120
 She just threw up her food again, we're done.

533
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,560
 Went back to that joker, no, that's it.

534
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,560
 No, he's pursuing you.

535
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,820
 He's looking for you.

536
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,360
 You're like, man, maybe, how do I know he's pursuing me?

537
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,200
 Can I, man?

538
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,440
 Consider where you're at right now.

539
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,140
 Like look around you for a minute.

540
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:16,860
 You're in a church listening to a sermon

541
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,080
 or something like it from the Bible.

542
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,040
 (congregation laughs)

543
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,920
 He's after you.

544
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,320
 I'd stop running.

545
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,080
 I mean, I'd say, hey, I'm gonna follow him.

546
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,480
 He's the only one, you think he can't handle you,

547
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,080
 he's the only one who can handle your sin.

548
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,040
 Don't you get that?

549
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,320
 Like that's what Jesus does.

550
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,760
 He's really, really good at handling sin.

551
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,000
 In fact, he's the only person that's ever lived

552
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,260
 that can handle your sin.

553
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,900
 It's his job description.

554
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,820
 He's a savior.

555
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,120
 Like that's what he's really, really, really, really good at

556
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,880
 is saving people from their sin.

557
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,920
 Like on his business card, it says,

558
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,700
 I pay for the sins of others so that they don't have to.

559
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,440
 That's what it says, right?

560
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,120
 It's like Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the living God,

561
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,680
 I pay for people's sins so that they don't have to.

562
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
 It's what he does.

563
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,200
 And so in summary, follow Jesus to freedom.

564
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:25,260
 Follow Jesus to life.

565
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,240
 And follow Jesus to forgiveness.

566
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:38,160
 You follow the world to a pit, to a trap,

567
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,540
 but you have now something,

568
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,420
 the chance to do something really amazing with your life,

569
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,040
 really revolutionary with your life.

570
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,780
 You can come into his care and say, I'm here, I'm yours.

571
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,620
 Will you lead me?

572
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,500
 I'll follow you.

573
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,180
 There's one that's sought to steal, kill,

574
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,320
 and destroy from me,

575
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,440
 but I know that you offer me the real thing, Jesus.

576
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,260
 There's a famous preacher in London

577
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,260
 by the name of Charles Spurgeon.

578
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,500
 And before an Easter message,

579
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,520
 he was walking the streets of London

580
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,780
 when he walked upon a young man carrying a birdcage,

581
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,460
 just kind of rattling it around like this.

582
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,280
 And inside the birdcage were three field birds,

583
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,380
 three sparrows, and the boy kind of had

584
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,420
 this sinister, snarly grin on his face.

585
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,980
 And Mr. Spurgeon said, son,

586
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,940
 what are you gonna do with those birds?

587
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,100
 And he said, mister, I'm gonna have some fun

588
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
 with these birds.

589
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,640
 I'm gonna tie them up and see if they can fly.

590
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,920
 I'm gonna pull their feathers out.

591
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,560
 I'm gonna see how long they can go without food.

592
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,180
 And he said, well, then what are you gonna do?

593
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,560
 He said, well, I got a cat.

594
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,040
 I'm gonna feed him to my cat.

595
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,000
 And Mr. Spurgeon said, son, how much for those birds?

596
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,680
 And he said, sir, you don't want these birds.

597
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,520
 They're field birds.

598
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,580
 I got them right over there, that tree.

599
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,020
 I'll get as many as you want.

600
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,980
 He said, how much for those birds?

601
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,660
 Boy thought he was kidding, kind of smiled,

602
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,960
 said 10 pounds, a lot of money.

603
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,600
 $500 today.

604
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,480
 He said, done.

605
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,100
 He said, deal.

606
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,660
 He said, I'll take them.

607
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,500
 That's what Jesus does.

608
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,700
 Satan, what are you gonna do with those young adults?

609
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,660
 These young adults?

610
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,980
 Oh man, I'm gonna have some fun with these young adults, man.

611
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,540
 I am going to make them jealous of each other,

612
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,700
 envious of each other.

613
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,060
 I'm gonna make them love money.

614
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,260
 I'm gonna make them, give them mannequins

615
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,020
 and then I'm gonna watch them sink to the manna close.

616
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,260
 I'm gonna make them sell their lives to corporate America

617
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,100
 and chain themselves to desk.

618
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,580
 And I'm gonna make them love each other and hate each other

619
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,300
 and love each other and hate each other.

620
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,960
 And I'm gonna have them come together

621
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,380
 and do the single most intimate act

622
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,380
 that anybody could think of outside of the designer's will.

623
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,820
 I'm gonna have them get pregnant

624
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,980
 and then take the life with a child.

625
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,980
 I'm gonna have them give themselves to religious rituals

626
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,020
 that they would show up and read books and sing songs

627
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,140
 and pretend to love the one true God

628
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,040
 when really they love themselves.

629
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,420
 I'm gonna fill them with pride

630
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,820
 and make them think that they're God.

631
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,420
 I'm gonna have fun with these young adults.

632
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,280
 How much for them?

633
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,740
 These young adults, you don't want them.

634
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:54,200
 They're self-righteous, materialistic, prideful,

635
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:01,860
 perverted, pornographic, anorexic, bulimic.

636
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,900
 They'll turn on you.

637
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,740
 You don't want these young adults.

638
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,460
 You don't want them.

639
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,560
 How much for them?

640
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:16,580
 Your whole life, done.

641
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,860
 It is finished.

642
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,500
 I'll take them.

643
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,580
 I'll set them free.

644
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:31,780
 Jesus is calling you out of the cage.

645
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,620
 He's calling you to a better life.

646
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,860
 He's calling you to life to the fullest.

647
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,700
 You will not have it any other way.

648
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,380
 Guys, because you're here tonight,

649
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,660
 you have the chance to be a part of a revolution.

650
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,740
 El Paso, Tulsa Springs, the Woodlands,

651
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,860
 Fort Worth, Houston, Dallas.

652
00:39:53,860 --> 00:40:00,220
 You have the chance to be a part of this revolution.

653
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,620
 It started in, it started today, 2017 years ago.

654
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,220
 Really at creation when God rolled out the world.

655
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,740
 But today, 2017 years ago,

656
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,940
 God became a man in the form of Jesus Christ,

657
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,820
 lived a perfect life and died for your sins

658
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,780
 and raised from the dead so that you can live forever

659
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,580
 with him starting right now.

660
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,740
 So we gathered in this room not long ago

661
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,740
 with some leaders of churches

662
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,340
 and we showed them a video

663
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,620
 that I wanna show you right now

664
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:40,620
 to inspire you to be a part of this revolution.

665
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,420
 Would you watch this?

666
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:55,180
 It started in darkness

667
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:00,180
 when all hope seemed lost

668
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,220
 and many had deserted their savior

669
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,500
 when everyone had lost faith in his promises.

670
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:14,660
 Jesus Christ, savior of the world,

671
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,780
 God made man, wakes from the dead.

672
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:26,140
 50 days later, the Holy Spirit spreads among the disciples.

673
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:30,660
 Common men and leaders alike unite behind our risen king.

674
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,740
 The church, the hope of the world is awake.

675
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:40,140
 Believers face threats and persecution on every front

676
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,980
 but Christ's conversion of one man from Saul to Paul,

677
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,060
 from minister missionary emboldens others

678
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,380
 to defy the Roman world, not with sword

679
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,820
 but with their love of Christ and one another.

680
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,420
 Among the greatest threats to the flame of the early church

681
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,300
 is a fire that destroys Rome in 70 AD.

682
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,740
 Nero blames Christians who are tortured

683
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,780
 and put to death in mass.

684
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:10,020
 The fury of persecution continues for the next 300 years

685
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,900
 yet Christ's bride thrives,

686
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,380
 defending its creed against heresies

687
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,660
 and caring for the sick and dying during plagues

688
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,380
 that ravaged the Roman empire.

689
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:24,740
 The cloud of persecution lifts from 300 to 451 AD

690
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,580
 and the church's focus shifts from survival to doctrine.

691
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,740
 In 325, the Nicene Creed declares the truths

692
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,380
 that we believe in.

693
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,940
 One God, creator of all things, one Lord, Jesus Christ,

694
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,820
 the son of God, the essence of the father,

695
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,860
 God from God, light from light.

696
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,700
 The gospel moves everywhere from Scotland to China

697
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,480
 and Germany to Russia but the light once in jeopardy

698
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,780
 from external forces is now threatened from within.

699
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,180
 Infighting and theological rifts persist

700
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,500
 for the next 400 years.

701
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,980
 Despite the turmoil, monasteries and religious institutions

702
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,220
 are established.

703
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,860
 Christ's message prevails.

704
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,200
 Believing that all Christians should have access

705
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,660
 to God's word, John Wycliffe begins work

706
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,800
 on the first handwritten Bible in English.

707
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,620
 The manuscripts face bitter opposition

708
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,620
 but the spread of God's word only accelerates.

709
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,260
 In the mid 1400s, the printing press is invented

710
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,320
 by Johannes Gutenberg.

711
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:37,380
 The very first book ever published is the Bible.

712
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,100
 A century later, Martin Luther nails 95 theses of contention

713
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,800
 to the church door in Wittenberg, Germany.

714
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,460
 Under the threat of excommunication and death,

715
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,380
 Martin Luther refuses to recant.

716
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,980
 The ideas he championed, the priesthood of the saints,

717
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,300
 the Bible as our central religious authority

718
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,440
 and salvation by faith in Christ alone.

719
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,600
 This set the Protestant Reformation in motion.

720
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,340
 The gospel then moves through both Central and South America.

721
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,220
 In North America, the Puritans arrive and churches move

722
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,420
 throughout the 13 colonies.

723
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,340
 But as in Europe, corruption threatens the heart

724
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,260
 of the American church.

725
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,920
 In 1730, the words of George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards

726
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,420
 confront a complacent church, ushering the great awakening

727
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,700
 in pulpits throughout America.

728
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,340
 Throughout the 17 and 1800s, the modern missions movement

729
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,820
 takes hold and the gospel spreads west

730
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,060
 into American territories.

731
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,020
 As the dawn of the 20th century breaks, D.L. Moody and others

732
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,300
 set the goal of the evangelization of the world

733
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,380
 in this generation.

734
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,960
 Wycliffe Bible translators labor to bring the Bible

735
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,740
 to every language group in the world.

736
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,820
 In 1892, a young evangelist, Billy Graham,

737
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,100
 proclaims the gospel to hundreds of thousands of people

738
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,700
 over an eight week period.

739
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,580
 He goes on to share the hope of Christ

740
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:06,100
 with 215 million people worldwide.

741
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,220
 In the heart of the American South,

742
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,780
 Dr. Martin Luther King confronts segregation

743
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,820
 and discrimination against African-Americans,

744
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,380
 inspiring God's people to spark change

745
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,060
 in our shameful history of racism.

746
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,820
 Martin Luther's revivals, reforms,

747
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,700
 and resurgences of the faith in the larger context of history

748
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,100
 dots on a timeline leading to this very moment.

749
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:40,940
 But pause to consider the men behind these moments.

750
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,220
 Did Martin Luther know the reform

751
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,700
 that the '95 thesis would ultimately bring?

752
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,460
 Did Moody, Gutenberg, Wycliffe see the generations

753
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,180
 of these men as a sign of the end of their toil?

754
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,180
 No.

755
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,940
 These men who responded faithfully to God's call,

756
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,140
 they never knew how God would use their legacy.

757
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,420
 They couldn't know that hundreds of years later,

758
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,140
 God would use their obedience to make history

759
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,220
 and to inspire a new generation of leaders.

760
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,620
 So I ask you, what are you making of this moment?

761
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,620
 What are you doing to shape the world around you for Christ?

762
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,060
 What are you doing to change the world in the first place?

763
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,620
 Yet somewhere along the line,

764
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,020
 as the forces of darkness threaten the light,

765
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,300
 we became discouraged.

766
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,980
 As the controversies and clashes with culture

767
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:36,060
 threaten the health of the church, we've become weary.

768
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,620
 That's why today we must break the chains

769
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,060
 of complacency and compromise,

770
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,020
 stand firm on the word of God, and renew our faith.

771
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,940
 We must remind ourselves that Christ's body,

772
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,060
 it's the hope of the world.

773
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,100
 We are not dead.

774
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,900
 Breathe on us, Lord.

775
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,820
 Now is the time for us to arise.

776
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,220
 Now is the moment where we become awake.

777
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:12,220
