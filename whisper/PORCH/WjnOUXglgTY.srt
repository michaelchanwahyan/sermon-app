1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,500
 - How we doing, Ports?

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,000
 (congregation cheering)

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,960
 Come on, come on.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,000
 Continuing our Vice and Virtue series.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,680
 I wanna start by just kind of flashing back

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,120
 to my life before Christ, BC days.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,560
 I'm here in Dallas, Texas.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,320
 I'm not walking with Jesus out of college.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,400
 And every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,960
 was spent at a bar or a club

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,640
 and really one particular club that we would always go to.

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,920
 So I moved five times all within one mile

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,120
 of lower Greenville.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,520
 And so that's kind of was the uptown of that day,

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,160
 the West 7th, the Baker Street in Houston.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,120
 It was just, it was the place where you would party.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,680
 And so we would go to this particular place all the time.

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,760
 And on one Friday night, I'm there.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,200
 And here's what would happen is we'd start at the apartment

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,120
 and with the tequila shots.

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,040
 And then from there, we would move to beer

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,480
 and then we'd go to the club.

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,960
 And that's when we'd open the bar tab

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,720
 and start with the mixed drinks

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,520
 because I would dance better when I was drunk,

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,120
 or at least I would think I'd dance better

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,280
 when I was drunk, you know?

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
 And so anyways, we're there,

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,800
 I'm moving my way to the dance floor.

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,440
 And so dancing, having a good time,

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,240
 see this blonde girl across the way,

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
 we might make eye contact, smile at each other.

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,400
 She starts coming my way and this is awesome.

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,000
 And so we're dancing, you know,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,480
 and it starts off a little bit of space in between.

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,640
 She has long blonde hair, beautiful,

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,800
 short little tiny dress.

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,960
 And so we're dancing, looking at each other,

40
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,520
 you know, all is great.

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,000
 And you like that, how I dance?

42
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,160
 And so, yeah, and there's a space in between us.

43
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,920
 And as the hours go by, and as the drinks are flowing,

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,800
 we get closer and closer.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,000
 And, you know, and sorry to be graphic,

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,800
 but we're on each other at this point, you know, grinding.

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,680
 And she's, you know, whispering in my ear,

48
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,800
 says, "Hey, I want you to go home with me."

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,280
 And I'm thinking, you know, this is awesome

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,680
 'cause that's really the goal of life in this time

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,360
 is we go to the club and hope to go home

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,240
 or take someone home with us.

53
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,880
 And so my mind is fast forwarding

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,240
 to what's gonna happen later on.

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,240
 And the club is amazing because the lights are down

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,200
 and all you see is the neon, the DJs up there mixing,

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,480
 the beat is thumping and it's just a party and it's fun.

58
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,240
 And it feels like this perfect environment,

59
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,920
 like just ecstasy kind of deal.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,680
 And so we keep going and the night's moving on

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,880
 and really we literally dance the night away,

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,840
 me and my new friend, and it's 2 a.m. at this point.

63
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,960
 And so the bar's closing, DJ plays, it's closing time.

64
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,400
 And we kind of, I start looking for my friends,

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,320
 she started looking for her friends.

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,100
 And we were there, that takes so long

67
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,720
 that they turn the lights on.

68
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,200
 And when they turn the lights on in the club,

69
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,240
 it's just everything becomes different.

70
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,160
 This place that was perfect and full of ecstasy and fun,

71
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,700
 you start to see all the little bar napkins

72
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,240
 all over the floor and how dirty it is.

73
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
 And oh, somebody threw up in the corner,

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,560
 that's what that smell was.

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
 And there's this kind of musty beer smell

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,980
 that just increases when they turn the lights on.

77
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,760
 And all the sexy co-eds kind of look like

78
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,040
 incoherent zombies at this point.

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,400
 You know, they've spilt drinks on their shirts

80
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,640
 and they're all sweaty and hot and it's kind of nasty.

81
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,520
 And then I see her, and it's not that she's not beautiful,

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,480
 but she just appears kind of needy.

83
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,120
 And she has these big bags under her eyes

84
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,760
 and this kind of look in her face.

85
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,760
 And at this point, I've sobered up enough to say,

86
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,820
 hey, I gotta go home.

87
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,880
 And she says, and again, invites me over to her place.

88
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,100
 And my friends are there now and I'm like,

89
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,160
 no, I gotta go.

90
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,160
 And then she kind of moves to like begging.

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,680
 And she grabs my arm and she kind of starts pulling me

92
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,400
 and I'm like, no, I gotta go.

93
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,800
 And what's going on is her lustful desires

94
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,800
 are making her unbelievably unattractive.

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,520
 And then she does something really weird

96
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,560
 I didn't see coming.

97
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,960
 She pulls out her purse and pulls out a couple hundred

98
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,040
 dollars and she says, I'll give you this.

99
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,440
 Now listen, I'm not the most attractive dude on the planet.

100
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,680
 I get that, okay.

101
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,320
 And this has never happened to me before.

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,200
 And this isn't where I'm kind of boasting

103
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,760
 about what happened in the past.

104
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,000
 That's not my heart here.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,160
 What I'm saying, and my heart in saying this

106
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,920
 is I never will forget this moment,

107
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,120
 even though I was intoxicated.

108
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,960
 It just was like, oh man, something's not right there.

109
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,760
 Like your lust has moved you to a dysfunctional place.

110
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,880
 And I gotta go.

111
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,780
 I gotta go quickly.

112
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,640
 I gotta get out of here.

113
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,960
 And I don't know where you're at in your walk with Jesus.

114
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,680
 I don't know if you've ever had that experience

115
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,180
 where the lights turn on, but my heart tonight,

116
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,880
 what I hope to do tonight is to turn the light on lust.

117
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,280
 That you would see it for what it is.

118
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,040
 That you would know what it is.

119
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,080
 'Cause it seems like it's this thing that is there

120
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,240
 and you don't really know, is it natural, is it not?

121
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,960
 What am I supposed to do with it?

122
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,760
 And where, it's gonna take you somewhere.

123
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,440
 So we're in a series, Vice and Virtue.

124
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,440
 And this evening we're talking about lust and self-control.

125
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,080
 And so last week we talked on forgiveness.

126
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,580
 If you missed it, I'd encourage you to podcast it,

127
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,520
 to go in the Poor Chap and get that.

128
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,760
 Really it was the gospel.

129
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,340
 That would be a message to share,

130
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,640
 like many of the messages in this series.

131
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,360
 But I feel like God did something special last week

132
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,140
 and I pray again that he's going to do it tonight.

133
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,780
 Tonight is mature content.

134
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,840
 If you came here with your eight year old,

135
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,280
 one, how did you get in?

136
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,840
 Two, I'm gonna pray in a moment

137
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,060
 and I'm gonna ask you to leave.

138
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,460
 And if you're here, you're listening to this

139
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,400
 anywhere in the world, you're under 18,

140
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,100
 I'm gonna ask that you turn it off.

141
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,340
 We are gonna speak really candidly

142
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,940
 on this topic this evening.

143
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,180
 And at this church, I don't know what church you grew up in,

144
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,660
 at this church we just handle these topics really candidly.

145
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,380
 And especially on a Tuesday,

146
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,500
 feel a lot of freedom to speak really directly

147
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,380
 to this issue.

148
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,240
 So let me pray.

149
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,620
 And that's where you would exit, again, if you're under 18.

150
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,660
 Lord, we do just ask for your help this evening.

151
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,020
 I know that the enemy hates this message,

152
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,260
 hates this text, hates your scripture,

153
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,160
 hates me and these people,

154
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,940
 and wants to see them abuse themselves on this topic.

155
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,720
 Father, I know my friends are all over the place

156
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,060
 in regards to their struggles.

157
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,120
 Lord, I pray for those that are listening online,

158
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,540
 couldn't get in the parking lot here,

159
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,480
 those in Houston and those in Fort Worth

160
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,480
 and El Paso and Tulsa and all over the world, Lord,

161
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,560
 that you would heal us tonight.

162
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,240
 I pray this would be a resource, God,

163
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,360
 as we read from the scriptures,

164
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,100
 that it would be a resource that we share with others

165
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,440
 and those who struggle, our friends and our peers.

166
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,920
 Set us free in Jesus's name, amen.

167
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,200
 Now, feeding your lusts is going to cost you

168
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,800
 more than you could have ever imagined.

169
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,880
 I'm going to speak from four authorities right now,

170
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,080
 and they're not all created equal,

171
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
 but the first one is the scripture.

172
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,320
 This is God who loves you, who has a plan for your life,

173
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,320
 and so he puts sexual sin in a special category.

174
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,480
 He says, "Thee who sin sexually, sins against his self."

175
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,720
 He alludes to, Jesus alludes to,

176
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,440
 to sexual sin can drag you all the way to hell,

177
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,160
 and that's a statement that's going to need some unpacking.

178
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,760
 I hope to do so before you leave here this evening.

179
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,160
 The second authority is my own experience.

180
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,620
 I've been a slave to this sin, okay?

181
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,740
 That's what you need to know.

182
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,000
 If we don't know each other,

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,120
 I've been a slave to pornography, sexual addiction.

184
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,920
 I have sat in that prison.

185
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,400
 I hope to turn the light on

186
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,560
 so that you can see the cell walls,

187
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,220
 'cause I've lived in it.

188
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,660
 I've seen the cost firsthand.

189
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,800
 The third authority is all of you.

190
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,100
 For the last 11 years, over a decade,

191
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,760
 I've met with thousands of you,

192
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,840
 literally thousands of you,

193
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,840
 that have fallen victim to the enemy's tactics

194
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,440
 as it relates to lust.

195
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,200
 I've seen those who've done it well

196
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
 and those who've done it poorly.

197
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,520
 I've seen those who win and those who lose.

198
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,600
 I've seen the likes of dozens and dozens,

199
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,400
 maybe hundreds of marriages.

200
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,160
 I know who is successful and who's not.

201
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,960
 So many obvious patterns.

202
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,760
 You think you're going to escape the odds.

203
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,760
 You think you're going to live outside of God's law,

204
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,960
 his commands for your life, and get away with it,

205
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,880
 and you will not.

206
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,640
 You won't.

207
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,520
 You will not be the first person

208
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,020
 in the history of history to do that.

209
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,360
 So I beg you to heed his warning this evening.

210
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,160
 And the fourth authority is just the current of our culture.

211
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,920
 What's going on in around us, the trends.

212
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,660
 If I was to have everyone stand up, and I won't,

213
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,920
 I don't want to embarrass anyone.

214
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,760
 The heart tonight is not to shame anyone,

215
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,800
 but if I said, "Hey, everyone stand up and sit down.

216
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,060
 "If you've had sex with less than eight people,

217
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,720
 "the majority of you would still be standing."

218
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,560
 I know that.

219
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,560
 I understand the problem that I'm speaking to this evening.

220
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,840
 If I said, "Hey, everyone stand,"

221
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,000
 I said, "Hey, sit down.

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,560
 "If you have an STD or you've had an STD,

223
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,100
 "you or someone beside you would sit down.

224
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,440
 "About one in three here this evening."

225
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,680
 If you, if I asked, you know,

226
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,240
 have you ever been sexually assaulted

227
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,960
 before this message is over?

228
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,600
 Maybe 40 or 50 times.

229
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,880
 Every 90, or way more than that, I'm sorry, my math is off.

230
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,380
 Every 98 seconds in America.

231
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:54,400
 Every 98 seconds that comes from RAIN.

232
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,080
 40 million Americans are sexually involved

233
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,920
 with the internet.

234
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,700
 That's such a weird sentence to read.

235
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,960
 40 million Americans are having sex with the internet.

236
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,200
 Eight out of 10, that's 80% of men between the ages of 18

237
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,740
 and 30 view pornography at least monthly.

238
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:21,040
 13 million American women click on pornography sites

239
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,880
 each month.

240
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,640
 I know it's not just a men's problem.

241
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,480
 I know that.

242
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,700
 I know it's not.

243
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,160
 One in three viewers of pornography are women.

244
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,160
 It's a huge issue, and it's hurting you,

245
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,440
 and it's killing your dreams.

246
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,840
 I hope to turn the light on.

247
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,260
 In the same way, if you walked into a room,

248
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,920
 and there's a baby in the corner,

249
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,800
 and he's playing or she's playing with a rattle,

250
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 some sort of baby toy, and then you turn the lights on

251
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,620
 to find out it's a rattlesnake.

252
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,560
 That's what this is doing.

253
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,600
 That's what this is like.

254
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,400
 This thing that we're playing with, that we've embraced,

255
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,300
 that we've called normal, it's killing you.

256
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,140
 It's killing your marriage long before you have a prospect.

257
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,500
 It's killing your intimacy with God.

258
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,540
 It's causing you to be depressed, increasing your anxiety.

259
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,940
 It's messed up your view of relationships.

260
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,680
 You have no idea what you're doing.

261
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,740
 Oh, while the enemy's entertained by you,

262
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,380
 you're gonna be entertained by me.

263
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,180
 I'm gonna start in 1 Thessalonians 4.

264
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,780
 If you think DFW or even America

265
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,700
 is a sexually charged culture,

266
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,340
 I would just tell you we have nothing on Thessalonica,

267
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,940
 and so Paul is writing this letter to the Thessalonians,

268
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,180
 and it is normal.

269
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,340
 There's no moral law here.

270
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,740
 You can have children, prostitutes, molestation.

271
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,020
 Rape is completely fine.

272
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,380
 There's no government going to come after you.

273
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,020
 Some of this is even encouraged.

274
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,300
 It happens in church.

275
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,100
 There's prostitution and temple worship

276
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,660
 through prostitution that is going on in this culture,

277
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,820
 and so they're worse off than we are today in 2018,

278
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,460
 and so he's going to write this letter

279
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,680
 to address these things, and he says this,

280
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,060
 and the reason I'm reading this to you up front

281
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,820
 is because it displays the dichotomy

282
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,500
 of lust and self-control.

283
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,660
 So I'm gonna start here,

284
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,100
 and then we'll dive into the points.

285
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,940
 It says this in verse three.

286
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,940
 It is God's will that you should be sanctified.

287
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,180
 That's a churchy word.

288
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,540
 It means becoming more dedicated to God.

289
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,460
 It's God's will.

290
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,940
 You wanna know what God's will is for your life?

291
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,740
 That you would become more like Christ.

292
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,060
 It's God's will that you would be sanctified.

293
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,220
 Here's how you do that.

294
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,700
 That you should avoid sexual immorality.

295
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,220
 That's the Greek word pornia.

296
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,020
 It's where we literally get the word pornography

297
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,660
 from this Greek word right here,

298
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,860
 that you should avoid sexual immorality,

299
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,260
 that each of you should learn to control your own body

300
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,740
 in a way that is holy and honorable,

301
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,140
 not in passionate lust like the pagans

302
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,780
 who do not know God.

303
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,420
 There's people who don't know God.

304
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,620
 See also me at that club and that girl

305
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,340
 at the beginning of tonight.

306
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,380
 I didn't know God.

307
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,220
 What was I doing?

308
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,820
 Exactly what I should have been doing,

309
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,540
 'cause I didn't know God.

310
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,780
 Why didn't I leave with her?

311
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,820
 Only common grace.

312
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,400
 I have no idea, no right explanation.

313
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,140
 But the Lord in his mercy

314
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,060
 protected me from further foolishness.

315
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,060
 And that in this matter,

316
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,740
 no one should wrong or take advantage

317
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,020
 of a brother or sister.

318
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,900
 You don't say take another drink

319
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,300
 or please can I go a little further?

320
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,340
 It's called rape.

321
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,780
 Be really careful.

322
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,700
 No, no, let's just keep going.

323
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,540
 Don't do that.

324
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,600
 But not for that reason.

325
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,260
 See the Lord will punish all those who commit such sins.

326
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,140
 You see that?

327
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,020
 The Lord will punish those who commit such sins.

328
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,900
 Fear the wrath of God.

329
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,140
 As we told you and warned you before,

330
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,900
 for God did not call us to be impure,

331
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
 but to live a holy life.

332
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,200
 Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction

333
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,440
 does not reject a human being.

334
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,980
 You're not rejecting me tonight,

335
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,660
 but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.

336
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,100
 And that's the only way you're gonna win.

337
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,460
 How are you gonna find victory?

338
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,940
 His Holy Spirit.

339
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,960
 That's all you got.

340
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,740
 What this text does is it sets up a dichotomy.

341
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,780
 It shows you two tour guides.

342
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,820
 There's two tour guides.

343
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,220
 They both wanna take you on a tour.

344
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,300
 Okay, one is your lust, your passionate lust.

345
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,380
 One is self-control by the power of the Spirit.

346
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,080
 This one is extremely attractive.

347
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,700
 And he gives you exactly what your flesh desires.

348
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,620
 And you look at him, you're like, man, I wanna follow you.

349
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,160
 But he wants to take you and chain you up

350
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,960
 and beat you and abuse you and cut you

351
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,640
 and throw you off a cliff.

352
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,680
 And this one over here,

353
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,480
 through the lens of the world, not so attractive.

354
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,820
 This one almost appears boring.

355
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
 It's kind of like your mom saying,

356
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,320
 eat all your vegetables, you know?

357
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
 It's like, eh, I don't know, it's good for you.

358
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,200
 And you're like, I'm just gonna follow you.

359
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,340
 And the path is, it's not very worn.

360
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,400
 Not many people have followed this tour guide.

361
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,720
 But the second you start to follow him,

362
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
 he pushes back

363
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,440
 the trees into an open pasture with a flowing stream

364
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,720
 and a beautiful beach nearby and animals of bright colors

365
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,900
 and beautiful paradise he offers you.

366
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,840
 He says, delight.

367
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,360
 Taste and see that the Lord is good.

368
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,380
 The dichotomy in this text, I'll show you.

369
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,060
 Under self-control, we see God's will.

370
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,140
 We see sanctified, that's becoming more dedicated to God.

371
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,080
 We see that we are able to control our body.

372
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,740
 We see that we're holy, honorable.

373
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,460
 This is where the tour guide leads.

374
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,620
 A life that is holy.

375
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,340
 We can be with God, by the Holy Spirit,

376
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,780
 with the Holy Spirit, with us at all times.

377
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,420
 And the other tour guide takes us to sexual immorality,

378
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,080
 passionate lust, straight from the text, pagans.

379
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,520
 That's unbelievers, people that don't know God.

380
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,760
 We take advantage of people, we'll be punished.

381
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,120
 It's called the sin.

382
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,640
 It's an impure life.

383
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,200
 It's for those who reject instruction.

384
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,500
 Choose your path, friends.

385
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,320
 Choose your path.

386
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,920
 Just choose wisely.

387
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,720
 Let's talk about what causes lust

388
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,840
 as we dive into this.

389
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
 We're gonna look at the cause of lust,

390
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,760
 the cost of lust, and the cure for lust.

391
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,560
 And before I dive into these points,

392
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,800
 I want you to know you will control your sexual desires

393
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,640
 or you will be controlled by them.

394
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,080
 You control your sexual desires

395
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,720
 or you will be controlled by them.

396
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,640
 Now, what we have to do up front

397
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,880
 is you have to self-identify, not publicly,

398
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,100
 but in your mind, you just need to know right now,

399
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,900
 hey, is this message for me?

400
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,000
 Do I struggle with this?

401
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,480
 Okay, and so let's just ask a few questions.

402
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,440
 As you think through pornography,

403
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,560
 have you seen it in the past six months?

404
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,520
 Have you pursued it?

405
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,080
 And I don't just mean porn of the traditional sense

406
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,880
 as an Instagram, hashtag chasing, social media.

407
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,200
 Have you looked at something?

408
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,520
 Have you masturbated in the past six months?

409
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,440
 Is that something that you've taken part of?

410
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,920
 Have you been sexually involved with someone

411
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,960
 in the past six months?

412
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,560
 Has you gone further than you were supposed to?

413
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,440
 Has your body, has you hung out with them,

414
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,480
 began to prepare itself for sex?

415
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,680
 I got a message for you.

416
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,740
 I'm glad you're here.

417
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,760
 Lord in His sovereignty, He's got something for you.

418
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,040
 Let's talk about the cause of lust.

419
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,000
 By defying it from the internet,

420
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,840
 it's a very strong sexual desire for someone.

421
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,640
 A very strong sexual desire for someone.

422
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,640
 Hey, I have a prediction that someone

423
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,080
 will soon be changed to something, okay,

424
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,720
 because our culture is getting more and more perverted.

425
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,640
 Soon, my prediction, it will be a very strong

426
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,440
 sexual desire for something.

427
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,400
 And so we're gonna talk about what this looks like

428
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,240
 in your life.

429
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,280
 It's four activities.

430
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,200
 Four activities, I think, that lust looks like for you.

431
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,740
 The first one is sexual thoughts and fantasy.

432
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,920
 Sexual thoughts and fantasy.

433
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,680
 You beginning to think through things

434
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,520
 as you drive down the road, just feeding thoughts.

435
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,880
 Hey, here's what I would do with her.

436
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
 Here's what I would do with him.

437
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,280
 Or man, did I see his six pack as he was playing volleyball

438
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
 and you're just feeding those thoughts.

439
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,420
 And man, what would it be like to be with that,

440
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,120
 watching the romantic comedy and just thinking,

441
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,960
 hey, I want something like that, feeding those thoughts.

442
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,840
 And then the second one is sexual acts

443
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,600
 outside of God's design for marriage.

444
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,000
 And this is sex of any kind.

445
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 It's oral sex, anal sex, vaginal sex, sexting, masturbation.

446
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,020
 It can be any sort of sexual activity

447
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,580
 outside of God's design for marriage, lust.

448
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,980
 The third one is pornography.

449
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,800
 Instagram, Snapchat, hashtag chasing, porn sites,

450
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,800
 movies, 50 Shades Freed, apps, virtual reality.

451
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,200
 It's where we're headed.

452
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,280
 Some of you have already been there.

453
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,520
 You've already drank from that muddy pond.

454
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,440
 Sorry.

455
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,520
 So sorry.

456
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,520
 The fourth one is masturbation.

457
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,760
 This is what you do with pornography or the sexual thoughts.

458
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,300
 It's sex by yourself.

459
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,560
 It's sex with yourself.

460
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,200
 It's sex with someone of the same sex, namely you.

461
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,720
 That's what this is.

462
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,080
 I'm not trying to shame you, but I gotta shed a light on it.

463
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,900
 And this is the cyclical cycle that we get into

464
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,480
 because you feed the thoughts,

465
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,080
 which is going to take you somewhere,

466
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,820
 always going to take you somewhere.

467
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,900
 You're gonna look at something, see something,

468
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,240
 then you act out on it.

469
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,520
 No one looks at porn and doesn't masturbate.

470
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,260
 Doesn't happen, right?

471
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,080
 You look at that to find and experience that release.

472
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,680
 That's what you're doing

473
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,420
 so that you can experience sexual release,

474
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,720
 so that you can find that high yet again,

475
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,600
 cope with another thing yet again.

476
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,700
 And we just get stuck in this cycle.

477
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,720
 The more we act out, the more we think about those things,

478
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,200
 the more we think about those things,

479
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,320
 the more we pursue them, and the more we pursue them,

480
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,780
 the more we act out on them.

481
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,340
 You think, how do I become a sexual pervert?

482
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:39,700
 Weinstein, Louis C.K., or whoever comes to mind

483
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,680
 when I say that I was a sexual pervert.

484
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,300
 How do you become one?

485
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,540
 One step at a time.

486
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,860
 One click at a time.

487
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,100
 One text at a time.

488
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,860
 One site at a time.

489
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,340
 One app at a time.

490
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,140
 And as we feed our lust, guess what happens?

491
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,260
 The appetite grows.

492
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:14,160
 Every time, every time you feed something, it grows.

493
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,300
 It gets bigger.

494
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,260
 That's the way that it works.

495
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,340
 This is the lie of one last time.

496
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,320
 I'm gonna call him one last time.

497
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,380
 We're gonna get together one last time.

498
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,500
 I'm gonna watch that one last time.

499
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,380
 I'm gonna go there one last time.

500
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,860
 No, you're not, because you just fed something

501
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,260
 and it got bigger.

502
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,420
 And so next time, it's gonna be more difficult.

503
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,160
 I'm gonna masturbate one last time.

504
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,740
 How many times have you said that?

505
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,820
 No, you're not.

506
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,100
 No, you're not.

507
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,000
 You know what you could say right now?

508
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,940
 The last times behind you?

509
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,980
 Man, take a deep breath.

510
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,780
 Everybody take a deep breath for me.

511
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,780
 Last times behind you.

512
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,540
 One more time.

513
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,780
 You don't have to do it anymore.

514
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,560
 You don't have to look at that anymore.

515
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,540
 You don't have to go there anymore.

516
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,780
 You can stop killing yourself.

517
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,540
 You can stop killing your marriage.

518
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,460
 You can stop killing love.

519
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:24,900
 So what is lust?

520
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,180
 The reality is you were born with a God-given desire.

521
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,060
 And it happens when you go through adolescence.

522
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,060
 You start to desire the opposite sex.

523
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,540
 You start to think about them

524
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,620
 and you notice them different.

525
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,700
 And if you were abused as a child,

526
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,900
 this can be different for you.

527
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,460
 And I would encourage you to seek help.

528
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,760
 We're here for you.

529
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,600
 We're helping.

530
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,440
 We would love to help you

531
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,140
 like we have hundreds and hundreds of others.

532
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,400
 But the reason that this happens around that time

533
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,920
 is because your body is able to make life.

534
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,780
 It's a pretty amazing thing

535
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,740
 that when a man and a woman come together,

536
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,560
 they can create another human being.

537
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,020
 This is God's genius design.

538
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,860
 And so this desire that's been inside of us,

539
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,980
 it's like a flame.

540
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,740
 It says in 1 Corinthians 7, 9,

541
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,120
 "But if they cannot control themselves,

542
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,960
 "they should marry.

543
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,660
 "For it is better to marry than to burn with passion."

544
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,060
 It describes that passion as a burning.

545
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,340
 I'll think of it like a candle,

546
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,960
 like a unity candle that everyone is born with

547
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,180
 or it shows up when you go through adolescence,

548
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:33,180
 a flame, some sort of burning, some sort of desire.

549
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,100
 But you can imagine what happens

550
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,040
 when you begin to look at pornography,

551
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,100
 when you begin to masturbate.

552
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,680
 It's like pouring kerosene on that flame.

553
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,240
 It turns into a dysfunctional, unruly bonfire

554
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,220
 that is going to burn everything that it touches.

555
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,180
 And so the cause of lust is you feeding

556
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,300
 your fleshly desires.

557
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,620
 Let's talk about the cost of lust,

558
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,720
 why it's so dangerous, the cost of lust.

559
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,540
 Again, the cost, you're burning every relationship

560
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,820
 that you get in.

561
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,100
 Let's take a look at those same four categories if we can.

562
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,540
 The first one, sexual thoughts and fantasy.

563
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,580
 Feeding these thoughts only cause the desires to grow,

564
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,020
 right, and so you're making it more difficult

565
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,180
 for yourself, I've said it before,

566
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,260
 it's like shopping with no money.

567
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,420
 You either leave frustrated or you take something

568
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,660
 that didn't belong to you.

569
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,260
 Those thoughts, you have to act out on them.

570
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,100
 You'll just get frustrated.

571
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,280
 And what happens is you just become

572
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,220
 like you feel dysfunctional.

573
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,500
 And so you ride an elevator with someone of the opposite sex

574
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,220
 and you start wondering what's beneath their clothes.

575
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,260
 You start wondering what his abs look like

576
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,300
 or you start wondering, your mind goes,

577
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,460
 you wonder, does her bra match her panties?

578
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,460
 These are the thoughts and then you go back to your desk

579
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,020
 and those thoughts are still spinning

580
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,240
 and you feel like you can't work and you're distracted.

581
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,460
 What are those thoughts gonna do for you?

582
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,380
 How are they gonna help you?

583
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,900
 You feel dysfunctional.

584
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,460
 The second one, sexual acts outside of God's design

585
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,300
 for marriage.

586
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,260
 Well, you know what happens, see, God designed sex

587
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,740
 for children and so what happens when a man and a woman

588
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,560
 have sex is she gets pregnant.

589
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,280
 And so there's 700,000 abortions a year.

590
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,940
 These are lives ended because of lust.

591
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:39,140
 That someone's lust literally cost a life.

592
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,300
 Let your mind get around that.

593
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,380
 A human being's not here.

594
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,740
 Listen, I know that's many of you,

595
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,860
 grace to you, we love you, we're glad you're here.

596
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,240
 I'm not mad at you.

597
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,540
 If you've trusted in Christ, God's not mad at you.

598
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,860
 For the sake of those around you, tell your story.

599
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,540
 Stop thinking you're gonna take that to your grave.

600
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,940
 That's a foolish plan.

601
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,580
 Receive grace and forgiveness and tell others

602
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,900
 so they can step into the freedom.

603
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
 Guys, I know this is part of your deal too.

604
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,380
 Some of you funded it.

605
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,140
 Tell your story, find healing.

606
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,620
 Stop staying in that prison.

607
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,900
 Kids are being born into a single parent home.

608
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:32,700
 40% of children now born to unmarried women

609
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,060
 comes from the CDC.

610
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,860
 We talk about STDs, here's the deal,

611
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,860
 for years and years and years,

612
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,620
 STDs have been on the decline until our watch,

613
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,740
 until millennials showed back up on the scene

614
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,980
 and now chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis,

615
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,540
 they're back with a vengeance.

616
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,940
 And the vast majority, the number one perpetrator

617
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,180
 is millennials, that's us.

618
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,620
 35% of Americans who have herpes do not know it.

619
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,740
 35% don't know they have it.

620
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,100
 One in five people who are living with HIV

621
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,620
 have not yet been diagnosed, meaning they don't know it yet.

622
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,660
 75% of women living with chlamydia don't yet know it.

623
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,660
 75% don't know it yet.

624
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,480
 Talk about how it's emotionally compromising.

625
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,160
 What we do is we train our bodies not to bond to someone.

626
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,740
 See, we're addicted to variety.

627
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,140
 So we'll never be satisfied by monogamy.

628
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,100
 You don't understand the dangers of having sex with her,

629
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,500
 and her, and her, and her, and her click, her click,

630
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,780
 her click, her click, again, returning to that website.

631
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,580
 You are retraining God's design.

632
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,060
 You'll never, ever, ever be satisfied in a marriage.

633
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,700
 You don't understand how dangerous

634
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,760
 this rattlesnake you're holding is.

635
00:28:52,760 --> 00:29:03,500
 You and I, the porn addict, is going to a university,

636
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,260
 meaning you're being trained over and over,

637
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,980
 you're being taught to use people for pleasure.

638
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,340
 And I've heard it said very well,

639
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,140
 and I love this 'cause this is so experiencely true,

640
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,500
 if you sneak over the fence to steal the fruit,

641
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,500
 it doesn't taste as good when you go through the front gate.

642
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,400
 You don't want the real thing, you want the counterfeit.

643
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,160
 You don't want filet mignon, you want dog food.

644
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,760
 You've trained yourself to eat dog food.

645
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,220
 And so when the filet is sitting on the table,

646
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,620
 you want the alpo, that's what your taste buds

647
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,880
 have been trained for.

648
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,700
 How sad.

649
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,980
 Pornography, the third category,

650
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,920
 what does it create?

651
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,100
 The cost of pornography, it creates sexual dysfunction,

652
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,700
 both, think about the two ends of the spectrum.

653
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,160
 You have erectile dysfunction,

654
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
 and then you have premature ejaculation.

655
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,980
 Because you're trying to do it as fast as you can,

656
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,840
 over and over, by yourself.

657
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,940
 So porn is gonna make you an awful lover.

658
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,560
 An awful lover, it's a selfish act.

659
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,760
 So when you come together with someone

660
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,580
 under the context of marriage,

661
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,480
 and you're supposed to love them selflessly,

662
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,620
 you have no idea how to do that.

663
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,420
 You've been learning the other way.

664
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,560
 I've gotta tell you, I say every time

665
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,680
 I tackle this message, I share the same story.

666
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,080
 You've gotta understand God's design.

667
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,840
 This is genius design.

668
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,840
 That God created our bodies to function the way they do.

669
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,120
 He made the parts, he loves sex, it's his idea,

670
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,920
 he invented it, it's a fantastic idea,

671
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,480
 an amazing invention.

672
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,600
 Whenever you experience orgasm,

673
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,620
 you experience the highest levels of oxytocin

674
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,920
 that your brain can naturally produce.

675
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,800
 The highest levels of dopamine

676
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,600
 that can be produced naturally.

677
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,520
 These are the feel-good hormones,

678
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,480
 the feel-good natural drugs in your body.

679
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,960
 And so sex is the most pleasure,

680
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,240
 orgasm is the most pleasure

681
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,040
 that you can experience naturally.

682
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,800
 And so what it does is when you experience that act,

683
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,760
 your brain creates synapses.

684
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,320
 Synapses are like muscles.

685
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,280
 Those muscles bond your five senses to your surroundings.

686
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,420
 Listen closely.

687
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,180
 So that whenever you experience an orgasm,

688
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,180
 the smell, the visual, the feeling,

689
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,660
 your body is very literally bonding to something.

690
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,080
 Psychiatrists call it sex glue today.

691
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,700
 Now you can imagine what happens

692
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,300
 when you introduce pornography.

693
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,340
 You get addicted to variety

694
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,700
 or you train yourself systematically

695
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,980
 not to bond to anything.

696
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,980
 A case study in this, this is in a psychological journal,

697
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,020
 a famous case study is about the boots.

698
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,980
 It's the boot story.

699
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,820
 And so a boy in adolescence comes downstairs

700
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,340
 and he had masturbated upstairs.

701
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,180
 His dad heard him.

702
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,060
 He comes down to breakfast.

703
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,260
 His dad makes fun of him.

704
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,380
 Parenting no-no.

705
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,060
 But for the rest of his adolescence,

706
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,380
 the boy would put on his boots

707
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,860
 and go into the pasture, into the backyard.

708
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,220
 And that's where he would masturbate

709
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,580
 for the rest of his adolescence.

710
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,420
 He didn't know where to look.

711
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,740
 He'd look down at his boots.

712
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,260
 To this day, now an adult,

713
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,340
 he cannot have sex without his boots on.

714
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,540
 Why?

715
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,100
 His brain bonded to his boots.

716
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,860
 There's another case study of someone

717
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,260
 who is sexually attracted,

718
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,460
 finds sexual release with their car,

719
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,900
 an inanimate object.

720
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,740
 Why?

721
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,560
 Because they bonded to it.

722
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,780
 There's thousands of stories of people

723
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,360
 who cannot have sex without a porno on the TV

724
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,120
 or a magazine open on the bed.

725
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,700
 This is what you're doing to yourself.

726
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,620
 How long are you gonna do it to yourself?

727
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,940
 Will you lift up your head?

728
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,660
 Will you look backwards?

729
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,380
 Has it been since the fifth grade?

730
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,100
 Has it been that long?

731
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,540
 How long are you gonna do it to yourself, friends?

732
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,740
 Would you stop?

733
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,780
 The last time could be behind you.

734
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,660
 Could be behind you.

735
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,800
 There's freedom in that.

736
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:36,440
 Consider God's brilliant design.

737
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,600
 When one man and one woman,

738
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,520
 they have not really experienced anything sexually.

739
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,120
 They come together on their wedding night.

740
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,280
 It's really awkward and uncomfortable.

741
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,120
 It hurts.

742
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,040
 It's not really fun.

743
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,320
 But they have an entire lifetime to experience.

744
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,720
 They don't know what they're doing.

745
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,640
 It's clumsy.

746
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,100
 But they have an entire lifetime to figure it out together.

747
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,340
 And as they continue to come together,

748
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,280
 and he hasn't experienced that with anybody else,

749
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,400
 she remains the epitome of attraction for him,

750
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,980
 even when she becomes 50 and 60 years old

751
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,580
 and 70 years old and 80 years old,

752
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,340
 his brain continually bonding to her.

753
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,780
 How beautiful is that?

754
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,640
 Is God not a genius?

755
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,720
 Do you see how we've perverted it?

756
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,940
 The risk of pornography is sexual deviance.

757
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:37,200
 This comes from a write-up, Neuropharmacology.

758
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,620
 It says the brain's reward center

759
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,160
 doesn't know the difference between porn that's okay to use,

760
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,040
 which there's not, and porn that's not cool.

761
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,500
 All it knows is that it likes dopamine.

762
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,660
 So when something sick or disturbing pops up

763
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,180
 and is linked with sexual arousal,

764
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,720
 the brain wires that into the user's sexual template.

765
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,120
 The same part of the brain that is stimulated by porn

766
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
 is the same part of the brain

767
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,400
 that is stimulated by horror movies.

768
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,600
 When you see someone get their head cut off,

769
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,220
 it's the same sort of sensation.

770
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,520
 Porn is an extremely slippery slope.

771
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,120
 You can see the growing problem of child pornography.

772
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,120
 You see how you start with just wanting to see someone naked

773
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,320
 and then wanting to see them in the act

774
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,000
 and then wanting to see multiple people of the same sex

775
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,560
 and then wanting to see bondage, S&M, animals.

776
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,940
 I don't know, it's a slippery slope, y'all.

777
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,480
 It takes you somewhere.

778
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,320
 That's an abusive guide you're following.

779
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,740
 He wants to kill you.

780
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:48,240
 Think about the phenomenon of 50 Shades of Grey,

781
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,280
 50 Shades Free now.

782
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,280
 That sadomasochism is becoming a normal pursuit.

783
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,540
 I can even say that with a clear conscience.

784
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:03,300
 Like, do you think that when God invented sex,

785
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,080
 he was like, man, I hope they tie each other up

786
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,200
 and hurt each other.

787
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,400
 Whips and candles and gags.

788
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,360
 Don't you see how you're getting tricked?

789
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,280
 I mean, Satan's watching you and being entertained by you.

790
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,280
 He's like, oh, look, they enjoy hurting each other.

791
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,720
 They think it's love.

792
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,480
 You are being fooled, man.

793
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,680
 Would you wake up?

794
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,260
 You are being tricked.

795
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,800
 It's not loving.

796
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,480
 It's hurtful.

797
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,800
 It's satanic.

798
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,440
 2012 poll said that most porn users agreed

799
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,880
 with the statement, my taste became increasingly

800
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,000
 extreme and deviant.

801
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,800
 Consider anal sex.

802
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,200
 Researchers in England recently published a study

803
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,040
 where they looked at boys, heterosexual boys,

804
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,680
 16 to 18 year old, and they began to ask them questions.

805
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,900
 And they said that they had been trying,

806
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,500
 most or many of them said that they had been trying

807
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,220
 to convince their girlfriends to have anal sex

808
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,480
 even though they knew that it would hurt her.

809
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,480
 Where did we go?

810
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,080
 How did we get here?

811
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,120
 I think we're lost.

812
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,520
 I think we lost our way, man.

813
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,680
 They were asked why.

814
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,620
 Why would you do that?

815
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,160
 Why would you want to do something harmful

816
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,920
 to your girlfriend?

817
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,420
 He said, because we saw it in porn.

818
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,420
 Satan's having a heyday, man, watching us hurt each other.

819
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,420
 Another side effect, symptom of porn,

820
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,740
 is you desire counterfeit.

821
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,100
 See, these women, they have fake breasts.

822
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,020
 The men are endowed differently than most men.

823
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,100
 And this just creates insecurity.

824
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,540
 See, she's not just comparing you to the eight men

825
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,100
 that she's been with.

826
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,180
 She's comparing you with the hundreds of men

827
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,540
 that she's watched.

828
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,980
 And she's comparing you to the eight men

829
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,300
 that she's been with, the hundreds of men

830
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,340
 that she's watched.

831
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,460
 And this is a terrifying thing for women,

832
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,820
 that you might be comparing her to your other partners

833
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,140
 or to the porn stars you look.

834
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,360
 And some of you have bought the lie.

835
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,180
 You want to look like a porn star.

836
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,620
 You look at them and you want your body to look like that.

837
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,460
 And you are just pursuing,

838
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,060
 you're not just pursuing the counterfeit.

839
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,620
 You want to be the counterfeit.

840
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
 One statistic said that in the near future,

841
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,940
 more people will be having sex with robots than humans.

842
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,340
 You want to know where we're headed?

843
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,980
 I just told you where we're headed.

844
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,180
 Jesus, come quickly.

845
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,780
 Porn kills love as a movement.

846
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,420
 Comes from fightthenewdrug.org.

847
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,420
 I'd encourage you to go there, fightthenewdrug.org.

848
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,620
 Lastly, let's talk about masturbation.

849
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,860
 Masturbation teaches you selfishness, not sacrifice.

850
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,820
 Masturbation makes you a terrible lover,

851
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,540
 as I said earlier.

852
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,500
 You get used to a particular feeling,

853
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,380
 yourself, and you seek to finish as fast as possible.

854
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,320
 It trains you toward premature ejaculation,

855
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,600
 premature orgasm.

856
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,660
 And can you think of a marriage, hell,

857
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,020
 that you would be in a covenant relationship

858
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,060
 with someone of the opposite sex,

859
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,420
 someone who loves God, someone beautiful,

860
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,220
 and yet you can't enjoy them

861
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,640
 because you'd rather seek pleasure by yourself.

862
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,280
 And it happens all the time.

863
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,920
 Like, I'm not talking crazy up here.

864
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,080
 This is a serious issue.

865
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,020
 It happens all the time.

866
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,000
 I want you to know, man, there is hope.

867
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,040
 There is hope.

868
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,280
 I can remember being in a small group

869
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,720
 after I became a believer,

870
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,280
 and we were going around sharing,

871
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,760
 and one guy said, "Hey, I just want to give you guys

872
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,440
 "some encouragement."

873
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,240
 Don't we need some encouragement in this message

874
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,080
 right about now?

875
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,080
 We need some encouragement.

876
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,280
 Let me give you some encouragement.

877
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,360
 He said, "Hey, guys, it's my anniversary."

878
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,720
 Anniversary, what are you talking about?

879
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,040
 You're not even in a relationship.

880
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,520
 Said, "Yeah, it's been three years since I masturbated."

881
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,660
 And I was a new believer, and I was like, three years?

882
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,480
 Is that even possible?

883
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,400
 You didn't die?

884
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,440
 You're still with that?

885
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,960
 You went three years?

886
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,860
 I didn't even know that could be done.

887
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,280
 And it can be done.

888
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,500
 That's what I want you to know.

889
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,360
 Now I've been following Christ for a while,

890
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,740
 and I have experienced personal, incredible freedom.

891
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:41,280
 And if you feel hopeless, and I've taught this enough

892
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,640
 to know that many of you right about now

893
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,300
 feel really, really hopeless.

894
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,400
 I tell you something, I found freedom,

895
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,760
 a freedom that I didn't think was possible.

896
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,560
 If you think that the solution was marriage,

897
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,400
 let me tell you something,

898
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,880
 it only gets a whole lot worse in marriage.

899
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,920
 It only, all of those desires and all of those problems

900
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,200
 only grow in marriage.

901
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,360
 You need to know that.

902
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,240
 I need you to take my word for it,

903
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,960
 or hundreds of other people I could have you talk to.

904
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,440
 And so this is what it's like, I read this this week,

905
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,640
 and this is what lust is like.

906
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,180
 And so stranded sailors, sailors that have been capsized

907
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,640
 in the ocean, the problem is they're out there,

908
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,680
 the sun is scorching them,

909
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,600
 you've seen this in the movie "Unbroken"

910
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,880
 with Louie Zamberini, they're out there,

911
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,840
 and they're so thirsty.

912
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,640
 But the irony is they're surrounded by water.

913
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,900
 And this is the biggest problem

914
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,180
 for those who have been shipwrecked.

915
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,720
 The number two cause of death is drinking salt water,

916
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,600
 because when you drink it, the more you drink,

917
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,760
 the more you crave it, all it's doing is poisoning you.

918
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,640
 Your body can't, your kidneys can't process salt water.

919
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,400
 And so you're sitting out there in the middle of the ocean,

920
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,120
 surrounded by water, drowned, I mean, dying of thirst.

921
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,040
 And in the same way, you are surrounded,

922
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,000
 you have a flame, you have a desire,

923
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,080
 and you're surrounded in a sexually charged culture.

924
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,540
 You can find nudity and sex of all kind at any given time,

925
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:14,760
 but do not drink, it's poisonous.

926
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,720
 And the more you drink, the more you want,

927
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,780
 and the more you die.

928
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,640
 It's a cruel cycle.

929
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:29,280
 And so what do we do, how do we find healing from this?

930
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,240
 The cost of lust is life and love.

931
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,160
 The cost of lust is life and love.

932
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,800
 And so let's talk about the cure for lust as we leave.

933
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,600
 The cure for lust, the cure for lust,

934
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,360
 I'll give it to you up front, it's self-control.

935
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,200
 It's learning self-control.

936
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,940
 And so here's what I want you to think about,

937
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,600
 like you're flatlined, like you're out there,

938
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,280
 and you need CPR, okay?

939
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,840
 Like you're dead, the screen just went blank,

940
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,640
 and they want the light to come back on.

941
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,680
 They want that heartbeat to come, beep, beep.

942
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,040
 They want it to come back on, so you need CPR.

943
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,880
 That's the acronym I'm about to give you,

944
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,040
 CPR, CPR, two times, CPR, CPR.

945
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,320
 The first C is for confess, the word confess.

946
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,560
 Confess at the thought level every time, write this down.

947
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,040
 Confess, confess at the thought level.

948
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,880
 When do you confess?

949
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,320
 When you think it, not when you act out on it,

950
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,160
 not when you do something, you confess then too,

951
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,960
 but confess at the thought level.

952
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,320
 You say, JP, I'll be confessing 20, 30, 40, 60 times a day.

953
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,520
 Confess 1,000 times a day.

954
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,280
 Wear out your community group.

955
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,640
 Oh yeah, community group, you're gonna need that too.

956
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,920
 You need people in this fight with you,

957
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,520
 other brothers and sisters who know you and love God

958
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,920
 and love you and know God, who are up for the battle.

959
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,760
 And you start to confess at the thought level.

960
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,440
 That is when you confess.

961
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,480
 And don't just, and let me just give you

962
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,620
 a scripture to go with that.

963
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,800
 It's James 5, 16.

964
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,320
 Therefore, confess your sins to each other

965
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,200
 and pray for each other so that you may be healed.

966
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,640
 The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.

967
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,040
 And so the second thing you do is you pray.

968
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,280
 Never have someone confess something to you

969
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,180
 and not immediately pray for them.

970
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,540
 That's the formula God gave us through James.

971
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,440
 When they confess, you pray.

972
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,940
 That's where healing comes from.

973
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,740
 They confess, you pray.

974
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,620
 And so you pray for them every single time.

975
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,400
 And you and I, we need to pray honest prayers.

976
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,680
 This is when I experienced freedom myself

977
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,840
 is I would wake up in the morning and say,

978
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:35,760
 God, I don't want to lust after a woman today.

979
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,580
 God, I don't wanna go back like a dog to his vomit

980
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,360
 to those websites today.

981
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,600
 God, would you strengthen me?

982
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,960
 Holy Spirit, would you help me to take my thoughts captive?

983
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,720
 When I think about her, help me to pray,

984
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,840
 help me to shift, help me to think about you.

985
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,720
 And you wage war and it's gonna be a battle, man.

986
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,180
 It is not for the faint at heart.

987
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,140
 It's not for little boys and not for little girls.

988
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,500
 It is an all out war for warriors and soldiers.

989
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,500
 And you gotta be up for the fight

990
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,620
 'cause there's some sleepless nights ahead of you.

991
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,860
 You wake up at 2 a.m.

992
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,260
 You don't know what to do.

993
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,100
 You fight.

994
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,740
 You're saying I don't sleep that night?

995
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,340
 Maybe not.

996
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,340
 You fight like you're at war.

997
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,740
 And the enemy's coming in through the window.

998
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,100
 You fight.

999
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,540
 Confess, pray, R is for repent.

1000
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,700
 Repent is to turn.

1001
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,780
 That's what the word means.

1002
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,900
 You change the goal.

1003
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,060
 Like my little girl when she's playing basketball

1004
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,460
 and she gets the rebound and she starts going the wrong way

1005
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,300
 'cause they change goals at halftime.

1006
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,580
 I'm her dad, I'm the silent.

1007
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,860
 I say, hey, you're going the wrong way.

1008
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,780
 Go that way, go that way, go that way.

1009
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,740
 And at some point she listens and she changes the goal.

1010
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,820
 You change the goal.

1011
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,300
 You turn from the desire for immediate gratification,

1012
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,380
 the desire for immediate pleasure, you change the goal.

1013
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,680
 You're gonna go without immediate pleasure.

1014
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,760
 That's what you need to know.

1015
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,940
 That's what's gonna happen.

1016
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,580
 You're no longer gonna gratify that.

1017
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,180
 Change the goal.

1018
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,780
 The second C is for Christ.

1019
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,300
 As you turn from your sin, you turn toward Jesus.

1020
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,500
 John Piper said, I know no other way to overcome sin

1021
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,740
 than to find a superior satisfaction in Jesus.

1022
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,460
 What do I mean by pursuing Jesus?

1023
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,500
 Look, I'm looking out here, I see a bunch of gifted people.

1024
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,020
 I see a bunch of young adults that God wants to use.

1025
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,260
 Fill your life with the things of God.

1026
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,380
 I'm talking Bible studies, community groups.

1027
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,840
 Maybe you go back to seminary, okay?

1028
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,080
 You start to read and study the Bible every day.

1029
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,300
 Write some songs, worship him every day.

1030
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,740
 You join a church if you're not.

1031
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,100
 Obvious, join a church

1032
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,500
 that you would get into a small group there.

1033
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,780
 You fill your life with the things of God.

1034
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,020
 Turn on Christian radio.

1035
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,260
 Start to read Christian books.

1036
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,900
 Fill your life with the things of Christ.

1037
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,600
 Get some accountability in the way that,

1038
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,180
 like I don't like to work out,

1039
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,420
 but if I know that somebody's gonna meet me up there,

1040
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,380
 I'm gonna be up there.

1041
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,340
 And so you get some accountability around you.

1042
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,740
 You pursue Christ.

1043
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,180
 This is when I knew that I was gonna be okay.

1044
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,060
 I was growing in my relationship with Jesus.

1045
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,880
 There was a billboard that I would see every day

1046
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,860
 on the way home on 635.

1047
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,580
 It was a woman in a bikini.

1048
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,140
 And every day I'd look at that billboard and I'd lust.

1049
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,620
 And one day I'm growing in my relationship with Christ

1050
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,740
 and I'm talking to him and I'm praying in the car

1051
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,660
 out loud as I drive.

1052
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,180
 It's what I do, radio off, I'm praying out loud.

1053
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,580
 And I know that billboard's coming

1054
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,540
 because I see it every single day and I'm approaching her.

1055
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,600
 She's beautiful.

1056
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,460
 And on this particular day I'm like, it's not worth it.

1057
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,860
 It's not worth this.

1058
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,380
 It's not worth intimacy with Christ.

1059
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,980
 I'm not gonna look at it.

1060
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,700
 And in that moment, it was the first glimmer of hope I had.

1061
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,740
 See, I thought I'd struggle with porn and masturbation

1062
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,620
 until I died.

1063
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:58,240
 And in that moment I knew I was gonna be okay.

1064
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,380
 I knew that the Lord was gonna heal me.

1065
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,840
 The next P is for pursue, pursue marriage.

1066
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,980
 Pursue becoming someone, the one you're looking for

1067
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,440
 or is looking for, we've said before.

1068
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,360
 Pursue marriage.

1069
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,220
 What I mean by pursue marriage is not go into marriage

1070
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,120
 with a porn struggle.

1071
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,660
 I mean find freedom so that you can get married

1072
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,120
 if you want marriage.

1073
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,360
 If you want to experience sexual intimacy,

1074
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,240
 that's your outlet.

1075
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,040
 And so you begin to prepare yourself for marriage.

1076
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,500
 I get asked all the time, what do I do

1077
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,280
 if my boyfriend's looking at porn?

1078
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,880
 What do I do if my girlfriend's looking at porn?

1079
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,720
 You ready?

1080
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,960
 That's where I make some enemies.

1081
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,800
 You break up.

1082
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,480
 You break up, you look them in the eyes.

1083
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,720
 You say, you know what, I love you too much

1084
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,720
 to stay in this relationship.

1085
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,080
 I want you to find freedom.

1086
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,960
 Maybe you wait for them, maybe you don't.

1087
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,160
 That's your prerogative.

1088
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,320
 But you point them in the direction of healing.

1089
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,220
 You say, hey, I don't want to be a stumbling block

1090
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,420
 for you getting well.

1091
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:59,160
 And so pursue marriage.

1092
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,440
 And the last R is you remove access.

1093
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,480
 You remove access.

1094
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,720
 This, in my opinion, is how I know

1095
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,680
 after a decade of doing this,

1096
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,680
 if someone's gonna get well or not.

1097
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,960
 If they're willing to remove access.

1098
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,080
 Like how do you look at porn?

1099
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,800
 My cell phone, you get rid of your cell phone.

1100
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,640
 How do you look at porn?

1101
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,960
 My laptop, you get rid of your laptop.

1102
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,840
 I'd have to quit my job.

1103
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,560
 You change your jobs.

1104
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,680
 You willing to change your job?

1105
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,520
 Let's play that game.

1106
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,800
 What are you willing to do to be free?

1107
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,260
 You remove access.

1108
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,960
 You audit, how do I look at porn?

1109
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,640
 You say, well, I can always do this.

1110
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,320
 Listen, absolutely, man.

1111
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,920
 But make it difficult for yourself.

1112
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,800
 Then you say, man, isn't that legalism?

1113
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,440
 Let me show you the words of Jesus.

1114
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,720
 He said in Matthew 5,

1115
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,640
 "You have heard it was said,

1116
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,980
 "you shall not commit adultery.

1117
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,160
 "But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully

1118
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,940
 "has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

1119
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,280
 "If your right eye causes you to stumble,

1120
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,060
 "gouge it out, throw it away.

1121
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,380
 "It is better for you to lose one part of your body

1122
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,400
 "than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

1123
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,560
 "And if your right hand,"

1124
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,560
 interesting that he goes hand there.

1125
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,940
 I'll let you think about that.

1126
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,280
 And if your right hand causes you to stumble,

1127
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,900
 cut it off and throw it away.

1128
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,460
 It is better for you to lose one part of your body

1129
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,300
 than for your whole body to go into hell.

1130
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,620
 And so he's saying, hey, this guy that you wanna follow

1131
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:20,180
 seeks to take you all the way to hell.

1132
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,500
 Am I saying that you can lose your salvation?

1133
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,100
 No, I'm saying that the Holy Spirit

1134
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,380
 does not allow Christ followers

1135
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,180
 to be given over to sexual immorality for their life.

1136
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,580
 That the Holy Spirit seeks to rescue you.

1137
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,120
 Will you respond to him?

1138
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,900
 And if you do not respond to him,

1139
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,120
 if you close your heart to the Holy Spirit,

1140
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,420
 why would you assume that you know Jesus?

1141
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:52,940
 These are the words of Jesus, and so get help.

1142
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:56,380
 In this room on Monday at 6.30,

1143
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,700
 for those of you in Dallas,

1144
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,060
 those who are listening, find a celebrate recovery

1145
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,840
 or a regeneration in your town.

1146
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,700
 In this room, Monday nights at 6.30,

1147
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,380
 you walk in and there'll be thousands of other people

1148
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,020
 who are seeking to get help.

1149
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,100
 You, listen, if you've looked at porn

1150
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,340
 in the past six months, don't come to the porch

1151
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,220
 next Tuesday, come to Regent on Monday.

1152
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,060
 I'd rather you go there.

1153
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,340
 I wanna see you well.

1154
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,420
 6.30, Monday night.

1155
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,300
 And so the cause of lust

1156
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,940
 is you feeding your fleshly desires.

1157
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,620
 The cost of lust is life and love.

1158
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,400
 And the cure for lust is allowing the Holy Spirit

1159
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,160
 to give you CPR, that you confess, pray, repent,

1160
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,760
 seek Christ, pursue, and remove.

1161
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,940
 CPR, CPR.

1162
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,240
 I think the goal for so many of us is marriage.

1163
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,240
 You wanna get married.

1164
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,720
 But the reality is you're gonna get into a marriage

1165
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,960
 and you don't understand that you're thinking

1166
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,560
 that marriage is your opportunity

1167
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,440
 to try all this crazy stuff,

1168
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,780
 the stuff that you've seen.

1169
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,440
 And so then you've got two options.

1170
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,500
 You can marry someone who's tried all kinds of crazy stuff

1171
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,400
 and they're ready for that.

1172
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,400
 Or you can marry someone who's really, really intimidated

1173
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,260
 by the fact that you wanna try all kinds of crazy stuff

1174
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,880
 and that doesn't go well for anybody.

1175
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,320
 And so you can think of an ideal would be,

1176
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,120
 like I said, that two would come together,

1177
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,360
 they don't know about the crazy stuff.

1178
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,720
 They've set no evil before their eyes.

1179
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,920
 And you say, man, how do I get there though, JP?

1180
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,120
 I'm so far past that, man, you don't understand.

1181
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,800
 You start the undoing tonight

1182
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,800
 that the last time would be behind you.

1183
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,280
 You guys have been to weddings, right?

1184
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,580
 Anybody been to a wedding?

1185
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,480
 Still with me?

1186
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,800
 I know it's long.

1187
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,740
 About to let you go home right now.

1188
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,360
 You been to a wedding?

1189
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,120
 Okay, good, like three of you have been to a wedding.

1190
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,960
 That's awesome.

1191
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,600
 Sometimes they do this thing, like the unity candle, right?

1192
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,520
 And so anybody seen the unity candle?

1193
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,000
 And so it's like the, you know, there's these two candles

1194
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,320
 and one represents the husband

1195
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,240
 and one represents the wife.

1196
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,320
 But for the person who has looked at pornography, right,

1197
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,640
 it's like that flame, that flame looks like that.

1198
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,380
 It's not like a normal flame.

1199
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,480
 So I don't know if we can kill this light,

1200
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,480
 but this flame, it's like a bigger flame.

1201
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,360
 I mean this light.

1202
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,560
 (congregation laughing)

1203
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,400
 Thank you.

1204
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,040
 It's like you've poured kerosene

1205
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,120
 and you're gonna go into marriage with that

1206
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,200
 and you think, you know, I'm gonna go

1207
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,440
 and light this candle over here,

1208
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,840
 but you're not just burning your life down.

1209
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,280
 You understand that?

1210
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,800
 Like it's not just your life that you've been burning down.

1211
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,320
 You're gonna burn her life down, his life down,

1212
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,240
 your children's life down.

1213
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,480
 Like it's all gonna be melted away

1214
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,620
 right in front of your eyes.

1215
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,260
 Can I tell you something crazy?

1216
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:08,380
 It's melting away right now.

1217
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,640
 You just don't know it, you don't understand it,

1218
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,760
 you haven't seen it.

1219
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,080
 Can I tell you something crazier?

1220
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,380
 God, he loves you so much.

1221
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,560
 He has you here.

1222
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,520
 He has you there.

1223
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,380
 He has you listening.

1224
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:28,360
 That you would understand the instructions

1225
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,360
 and not just watch a life melt away like that.

1226
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,740
 That he has a better plan for you.

1227
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,840
 That when two become one,

1228
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,280
 that it would be this beautiful expression of love

1229
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,060
 by the power of the Holy Spirit.

1230
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,520
 That it'd be the beginning of the creation of a family.

1231
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,760
 That they'd have children and they'd raise them to know God,

1232
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,820
 the one true God.

1233
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,920
 Such a beautiful thing.

1234
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,600
 Some of you women, you're hearing this and you're like,

1235
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,000
 man, JP, you don't understand, I don't have an option.

1236
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,880
 Like I wanna get married but nobody's asking me out.

1237
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,820
 You should especially hate porn.

1238
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,840
 Not give into it, not take the shortcut.

1239
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,340
 The reason is pornography.

1240
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,600
 It's keeping you single.

1241
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,720
 Not just your struggle, their struggle.

1242
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,560
 You should especially hate it.

1243
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,680
 Some of you, you're really gifted.

1244
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,680
 Like you might need to go into politics

1245
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,920
 and write the government and do something

1246
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,440
 to abolish pornography.

1247
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,920
 For the sake of children who are being,

1248
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,200
 that thing's doing something crazy over here.

1249
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,400
 Insane.

1250
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:45,520
 You can just see, it's just melting away your life.

1251
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,480
 You worry about that lamp?

1252
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,300
 I see you.

1253
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,140
 (congregation laughing)

1254
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,420
 That's all part of the illustration,

1255
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,820
 like you catch yourself on it.

1256
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,460
 (congregation laughing)

1257
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,860
 It's melting away your life.

1258
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,380
 There's no unity in that.

1259
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:08,700
 That's what's happening, that's what's been happening.

1260
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,300
 That's what you've been a part of.

1261
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,100
 I'm gonna pray for us.

1262
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,980
 I'm gonna pray for you.

1263
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,420
 Some of you, you think I've been talking to you

1264
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,980
 and it's because I've been talking to you.

1265
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,300
 I hope the Holy Spirit's been talking to you.

1266
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,420
 What if the last time was behind you?

1267
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,060
 What if the next time you experience

1268
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:40,060
 any kind of sexual release that you prompted,

1269
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,220
 you're on your honeymoon,

1270
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,380
 with someone who loves Jesus more than you?

1271
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:51,180
 And you know, it's not full of shame.

1272
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,500
 You're not wondering how many people

1273
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,740
 they're comparing you to.

1274
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,980
 You're not trying to perform.

1275
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:03,700
 You're just making beautiful love,

1276
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,900
 an act of worship, it's an act of worship.

1277
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,620
 How awesome would that be?

1278
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,980
 Father, would you make that true for my friends?

1279
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,500
 Here in Dallas.

1280
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,380
 In Fort Worth.

1281
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:29,780
 Houston, Tulsa, El Paso, South Africa,

1282
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,620
 wherever somebody's listening to God.

1283
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:37,620
 Would you set them free?

1284
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:43,100
 Father, I wanna thank you for the freedom

1285
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,780
 that I've experienced personally.

1286
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:48,980
 That you would allow me to take my mess

1287
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:52,980
 and make it a message, it's a privilege.

1288
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:58,900
 Father, would you do something powerful this evening?

1289
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,820
 In the hearts of my friends,

1290
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,980
 that some of them are here with their significant other,

1291
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,820
 it's been so awkward this whole time,

1292
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:11,300
 and there's gonna be some breakups in the parking lot.

1293
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,140
 Would you give them courage?

1294
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:24,980
 Lord, some of them, they feel like you've forgotten them.

1295
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:29,060
 They wanna get married and they're just like, where?

1296
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,780
 And like I've been saving myself

1297
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,060
 and I've been pursuing purity and where is he, Lord?

1298
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,860
 Would you help them to get out of the waiting room, God?

1299
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:42,580
 And to set the focus on making much of you with their life.

1300
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,020
 Using their singleness.

1301
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:50,900
 And Father, I don't wanna end this prayer

1302
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,340
 or this message or this evening

1303
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,020
 without celebrating the gospel.

1304
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:58,220
 So I declared in this prayer that your son, Jesus Christ,

1305
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,780
 has died for all our sins, past, present, and future.

1306
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:05,220
 He died for every time we've looked at pornography,

1307
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,460
 every time we've masturbated,

1308
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,260
 every time we've had sex of any kind, God.

1309
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,700
 Jesus died for that, he paid for it.

1310
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,140
 You aren't holding that against us.

1311
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,500
 Would you allow us to embrace that payment,

1312
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,340
 to celebrate that freedom,

1313
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,980
 and to not continue to sin,

1314
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:26,260
 but to live a life for you?

1315
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:31,620
 In the name of Christ Jesus, amen.

1316
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:41,620
