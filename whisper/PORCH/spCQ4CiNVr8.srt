1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Here lies the old me.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 The kid my parents wanted me to be.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 All the ways the world hurt me.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Goodbye to my fears and anxieties.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 The reason why my ex left me.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Rest in peace to the old me.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 All right, welcome everybody in the room, everyone up front.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 All the Forge Live locations, Indianapolis, North Houston,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Tulsa, Scottsdale, Cedar Rapids, Boise, wherever you are at, welcome.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We are wrapping up this series, RIP, rest in peace to the old me.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Where we have been looking at what it looks like for Christians,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 those of us who have put our faith in Jesus, to live out the new life.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5, verse 17,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 "If anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation."

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 The moment you trusted in Jesus, you were not made better, you were made new.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 You were born again.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And now the Christian life is living out who God calls us

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 and who God says that we are.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 So we have been marching through that.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Tonight we are going to wrap up the series and talk about an issue that I think,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 candidly, if anything, the weight I carry is how to convince a room like this

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 of the enormous importance of what we are about to talk about.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Before I dive in there, let me invite you into my world.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I have got a 3-year-old daughter named Monroe.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Here is a picture of her.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 She is a princess for days.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 When you have girls like my son, and I have got another newborn son,

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 but with her the contrast is so stark in that he wants to wrestle,

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 wants to play sports, wants to punch things,

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 and she wants to dress up like a princess and have tea parties.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 So we have tea parties.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 We sit down and we walk through and she will make--

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 if you have a 3-year-old--this is going somewhere--

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 the tea party does not look quite like this one,

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 but it does involve a little miniature set.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 She will sit there and she is like, "Daddy, would you like some tea?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I will make you some tea."

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 She puts in the fake sugar.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 She is like, "Would you like some cream?"

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Because she does not say cream.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 She says cream.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Then her older brother comes in and is like, "It is cream, Monroe."

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I am like, "I will spank you so hard."

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 She can say cream until she is 23 if she wants to.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 It is the greatest thing ever that she cannot do her R's.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 We will sit there and she wants to just do tea parties.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Now what does it have to do with what we are talking about tonight?

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Well, we are talking about RIP to the subject of gossip.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 There is an expression that we use as it relates to gossip

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 that is directly related to tea parties.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 It is spill the tea.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 The reason it is kind of a genius analogy that people understand

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 is that just like with tea, you have this thing where you sit down

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 and historically tea time, tracing all the way back to Europe and England and London

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 where people would sit down and over a cup of tea,

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 people would get together and discuss the royals and discuss the latest gossip

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 and discuss the latest drama and they would sit there.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Even today we embrace some of the language of like,

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 "Oh, that is some boiling hot tea.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Woo, this is so hot."

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Or, "Man, the tea, it is brewed, it is fresh and let me spill it to you."

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 What do they mean by that?

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 They mean, "Have you heard about what she did?

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Did you know?"

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Man, you can't--don't tell anybody else I told you this.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 But I found out and we spill the tea and we gossip

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 and we take that and we pass on gossip.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Now, what could be the problem with that?

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Well, just like in that situation,

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 if I was to pass on a cup of tea to somebody out here,

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 it inherently depends on what you're consuming.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And if it's poisonous, which the Bible says that gossip is,

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 it's going to have some significant consequences for those who take it in.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And the Bible also says that it doesn't just have consequences for those who take it in,

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 it has consequences for those who pour it out.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And I want to talk about why God says this is such a big deal for the next few minutes.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 But before we go there, let me define gossip.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And in order to do so, I want to go to the fountain of all human wisdom, Urban Dictionary.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Urban Dictionary says this, "What is gossip?

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 It is something nasty people do when they are bored, have no life, or are really stupid.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 It's nasty because a lot of the time you never hear about it

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 and people are way too PC to admit and are nice to you to your face,

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 but spread nasty gossip behind your back.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And you never know what happened when someone suddenly hates you and for no reason,

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 or some people start threatening you for no reason,

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 or become some losers with no life or brain decided gossip

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 because they're too stupid to have any hobbies or real social life

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 or any shred of conscience whatsoever."

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Gossip is what happens when you get a knife in your back.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Man, I don't know who you are, Clueless Furball,

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 but someone clearly hurt you back in November.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Now gossip, even that definition, and how great is Urban Dictionary

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 that just anybody can write it up, everybody gets to play,

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 but that is a reflection of clearly someone who's been hurt by gossip.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Now let me give a more narrow and accurate, concise definition.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Gossip is talking negatively or spreading negative information about someone not there.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Gossip is spreading negative information or talking negatively about someone

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 behind their back or not there.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 In other words, a lot of times people think gossip is not gossip if it's true.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Yes, it is.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Gossip is talking negatively about someone behind their back

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 who is not a part of the problem or the solution.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And I'm going to unpack exactly what I mean by that.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And this is an issue that as I started, I feel a burden that, honestly,

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 there are some of you that no matter how hard I plea with how deadly and destructive

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 and if you participate and allow gossip to be a part of your regular life,

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 it's going to be for the rest of your life.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 God says in Proverbs 6, he lists out six things that he hates,

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 and one of them is directly related to gossip.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 In other words, God says, "Let me give you the six things that I hate."

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 One of them is somebody who murders. One of them is somebody who lies.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And then he says this in Proverbs 6, 16 and 19,

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 "There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to him."

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Verse 19, someone who pours out lies and a person who stirs up conflict in the community.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 In Romans 1, the apostle Paul writes out and he lists behavioral characteristics

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 of people living in direct rebellion to God.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And he includes some very fascinating things and the things we would assume,

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 like murderer, and he includes gossip.

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 He says this, Romans 1, 29 and 30,

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 "Those living in rebellion to God are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, boastful.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 They invent ways of doing evil," and he continues the list.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Why would God say it's such a big deal?

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 It's just spilling the tea, it's just catching up,

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 it's just me venting a little bit of what's going on.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Why would that be such a bad idea?

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Because as we're going to see, like few other things,

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 gossip has the ability to destroy relationships,

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 to destroy some of the closest of friendships,

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 to destroy and create toxic work environments, toxic families.

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And so God writes over and over and over about when it comes to believers in Jesus,

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 gossiping and talking negatively about someone who is not present

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 is not to be a part of our lives.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 So I want to walk through quickly in the next 30 minutes the reasons why we gossip,

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 the results of that gossip,

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 and then what Scripture says is the remedy or the way that we remove gossip inside of our life.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And some of you guys, you're tuning me out right now,

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 and this makes up 70% of what you talk about.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Like if you were to remove all gossip from your conversations in life today,

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 you would have said like seven words.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 You'd have been like, "It's cold," or "It's hot."

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 It's how you bond at work.

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 It's how you catch up in community.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And it is an offense to God.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And it's something that, candidly, as a bigger brother,

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I am pleading with you to listen to the instructions that God gives us

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 so that you can experience the type of relationships, unity, peace,

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 that in your heart of hearts you want and so few people experience.

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 So we're going to look at the reasons, the results, and the removal.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So number one, the reasons why we gossip.

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Let me read this proverb from Proverbs 18, verse 8.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Proverbs written 3,000 years ago by the wisest man who ever lived.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And he's talking about gossip.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 "The words of a gossip are like choice morsels or delicious desserts.

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 They go down into the inmost parts."

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 So Solomon says, "Hey, gossip, it tastes good."

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 The reason why we gossip is it feels good.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 There's all kind of different connecting things to why it feels good.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Oftentimes, it's directly related to an insecurity that I have,

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 that I feel better about myself.

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And when I talk negatively about someone who I'm a little bit jealous of

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 or someone who makes me insecure,

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 or the fact that just I am insecure in general,

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 and it's a self-esteem boost for me to put that other person down

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 and I can't believe it.

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Did you see the car that he drives?

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Did you see the picture that she posted on Instagram?

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I mean, she's a great girl, but unbelievable.

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And I feel better.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And Solomon says, "That's because gossip, man, it tastes good on the lips,

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 but it's doing something to your soul.

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And it goes down deep and buries into the person who listens to it

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and who pours it out."

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 That gossip, all the reasons why are not good reasons.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Other times, we do it because we've just been hurt.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Like, candidly, some of you guys gossip about people

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 who aren't even the ones who hurt you,

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 but they remind you of somebody who hurts you.

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And so it just feels good to, "Man, I know their type,"

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 or, "I know what they're always like."

182
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And you don't even know them.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And yet we gossip.

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Other times, it's just pride that I feel more self-righteous

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 if I can identify things in your life that are off

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 because it makes me feel better about myself.

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And all the reasons and all the ways that it makes us feel good

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 have one thing in common.

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 None of them are good or godly.

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Other times, we just gossip because I kind of want to be the person

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 with the insider information, have you known?

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 And that really just reflects, I need the approval of another person.

193
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 I need affirmation.

194
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 And Solomon says, "Man, the reason why people gossip is that,

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 man, it tastes good, it feels good to spill the tea,

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 but it does something deep into your soul."

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 That's what the inner parts he's reflecting are.

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And it's a really brilliant analogy because he says,

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 "Man, they're like desserts that you eat."

200
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And what happens with desserts that you eat?

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 All of these different chocolates, cakes, cookies have one thing in common.

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 They taste amazing.

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And they have another thing in common, I guess, as well,

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 that they last a moment on the lips and a lifetime on the hips.

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 [laughter]

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Because they stick with you.

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And if you eat them and you consume them, they may taste good for a moment,

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 but they are going to be sticking around, if you will.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And if you were to eat all of them, it's going to make you sick.

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And this is Solomon's point.

211
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 "Man, you think you're just consuming the tea, and you heard about her,

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 and did you know that they did this, and they slept together.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Can you believe that?"

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And it goes down in a moment, but it goes deep into your soul.

215
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And it impacts the way that you see them.

216
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 It impacts a deep soul level to you that it's just a moment on the lips,

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 but it's going to stick.

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And Solomon said it goes deep into the heart of a person.

219
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 The second reason the Bible says that you and I gossip

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 is not just because it feels good,

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 but because it leads to toxic stuff being poured into our heart,

222
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 is Jesus says it's ultimately an issue of the heart.

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 That a person, when they gossip, just like with anything that they say,

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 it's not an issue of the mouth, it's an issue of the heart.

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 He says in Matthew 15, starting in verse 18,

226
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 "What comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart."

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 If you've got a word problem, you've got a heart problem.

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And this is what defiles a person.

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 "For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery,

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 sexual immorality, false witness, slander, or gossip."

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 And he says ultimately, if somebody's a gossip, they think,

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 "Oh man, I just need to make sure I don't say that about her,

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 or I need to not say that again."

234
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Jesus would say, "No, you've got a heart problem."

235
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 When a friend of ours bought their first house, a married couple,

236
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 they moved in and they decided they wanted to put French doors

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 in the back of their house.

238
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And so they knocked down part of the wall and began to open it up

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 to put these French doors that were in, or these double doors.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And they realized when they opened up the walls and they knocked that down,

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 they could see in the walls, and it was infested with termites everywhere.

242
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Thousands and thousands of dollars would have to be spent

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 in order to remove the termites,

244
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 because it was literally rotting on the inside.

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And the picture Jesus gives of somebody who gossips

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 is there's a part inside of their heart that is rotting on the inside.

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And he's going to tell us how to remove that,

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 and how he can be a part of removing that.

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 But that's ultimately what it is.

250
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 I mean, you think that you just don't like her because of the thing

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 that she posted, or because of the way that you interacted with her.

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 And ultimately, the reason why you don't like her is because

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 she's in a dating relationship, and you've been single for a little bit,

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 and you hold that against her.

255
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And you have jealousy that's in your heart.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Or you think that you just don't like him because he was rude,

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 or he just puts off a vibe that you don't like.

258
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And ultimately, he reminds you of somebody who hurt you

259
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 or bullied you in your past.

260
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 He reminds you of maybe some affirmation that you didn't get

261
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 from parents or something there.

262
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And I'm not trying to pick on you.

263
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 I'm saying Jesus says whenever something's coming out of the mouth,

264
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 it's coming from the heart.

265
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And a person who needs to find affirmation or who lives a life

266
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 and puts people down, talks negatively about them with them not there,

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 has something rotten in their heart.

268
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And there's a way he prescribes for us to remove that.

269
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But it comes because it feels good or tastes good, Solomon would say,

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 and because of an issue in the heart.

271
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Then the results of gossip,

272
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 which I think reflects why God is so passionate about this.

273
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 In point two, the results of gossip.

274
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Proverbs 16, verse 28 says this.

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 "A troublemaker plants seeds of strife, of conflict."

276
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 I want you to listen to these next five words, six words.

277
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 "Gossip separates the best of friends.

278
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 That Solomon says gossip is such a powerful force

279
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 that you and that person that's your bestie,

280
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I mean, we are closer, thick as thieves, ride or die.

281
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Gossip has the potential to get into that relationship

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 and completely erode it to where your best friend and you

283
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 are no longer even on talking terms.

284
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And it all happens through just seeds of distrust.

285
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And did you hear, and I can't believe,

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 that it has the ability to divide like few other things the Scripture say.

287
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I don't know if there's another example in Scripture where it says,

288
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 "Hey, you know what can divide the best friends out in the world?

289
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 This, other than gossip."

290
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And God, who's for you and loves you and loves man,

291
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 wants to know, the results of gossip is broken relationships.

292
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And you think that you're just talking or you're just speaking off the cuff,

293
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 and you're kind of just flippantly, and it's not that big of a deal,

294
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 but it has the potential to destroy relationships in your life.

295
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Because gossip can bring about and separate and divide.

296
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 There was a saying in World War II that loose lips sink ships.

297
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Basically, that saying originated from U.S. and U.K. or British naval fleets

298
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 who were trying to prevent German intelligence from listening to Morse code

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 or listening to radio signals and getting a hold of information

300
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 of different naval carriers or different warships that were out there.

301
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And so they would say, "Hey, loose lips sink ships.

302
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Be very careful how you communicate because British intelligence could identify, locate,

303
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 and because you said it out loud, now a torpedo is taking out the boat."

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And the same thing is true today.

305
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Loose lips sink ships.

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 It'll sink friendships and relationships that you have the ability with your words

307
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 to erode and destroy--maybe it's not even your friends.

308
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 It's the friendships and the relationships with other people.

309
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And the Bible says in so many places we don't even have time

310
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 that it is gossip that leads to conflict, that leads to arguments,

311
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 that leads to dysfunction, that leads to disunity.

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Some of you guys see this every single day at your workplace,

313
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 that are some incredibly toxic environments where people just gossip,

314
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 and, "Did you hear?" and, "I cannot believe." and, "Man, what are they doing at that happy hour?"

315
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And that's an okay thing when it comes to people who don't know God.

316
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 But for Christians, God says it's not to be tolerated.

317
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 There was a girl that joined our team about six years ago,

318
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 and she was coming on to basically be a part of an internship program.

319
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And we were told by somebody, "Hey, this girl is going to join your team for the next year,

320
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 and she lives in Florida, and so will you guys reach out?"

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And so my entire team got in a conference room, and we called her, and she didn't answer.

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 So we left a voicemail, and it was, "Hey, Elena was her name. We're so excited.

323
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You're going to be on our team. It's going to be awesome.

324
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Can't wait for you to be here and move here next month and meet you in person."

325
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Done.

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And we began to talk and began to joke in a way that, candidly, was not great,

327
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 in that we began to go, "Man, I wonder what she's doing.

328
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Well, she's in Florida. She's probably on a beach somewhere.

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 She's wearing a bikini, and now we're going to work at a church."

330
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 And she's like, "Oh, I've got a margarita and a bikini and can't answer this phone call."

331
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And we just began to totally throw this girl under the bus in a joking, playful way,

332
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 which often is the case.

333
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And then out of nowhere, I hear, "To send your message, press 1.

334
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 To erase and re-record, press 2."

335
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And all of us went, "Oh!"

336
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And I walked, and it slowly--like, those moments where you're like,

337
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 "I've got to make sure I hit 2, not 1, at the last minute," and pressed 2.

338
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 "Hey, Elena. Can't wait to meet you. See you soon. Boop!"

339
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And I think back on that, despite the fact that even the intentions were lighthearted.

340
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Imagine if you had heard that and you were her,

341
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 how you would feel walking into this new environment where you know no one,

342
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 how you would think people think about you,

343
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 even though those thoughts and those words weren't even really accurate,

344
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 and they certainly weren't fair.

345
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And yet this is what happens all the time with people--gossip.

346
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 It begins to make sense why God is so passionate about,

347
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 "My people are not to be marked by gossip, by talking negative about someone who is not there."

348
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I mean, the second thing it leads to--so broken relationships--is a poisoned perspective.

349
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Think about the power of a perspective change that you can have through someone's words to you.

350
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 If somebody was to find you after the service and say,

351
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 "You know what? I heard David. He's a real jerk. He's having an affair on his wife."

352
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Whether that was true or not true,

353
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 even though it wasn't true, you would leave here and go,

354
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 "I don't know if I can trust this place, and that's messed up that he would be doing that."

355
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And it would be based off of a lie--gossip.

356
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And now you're going, "I don't even know if I can trust people who are talking about the Bible."

357
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Watermark is a good example of this.

358
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Watermark gets shade thrown at it all the time and just crazy stuff that is said

359
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 that, tragically, if people listen to are going to say,

360
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 "Man, I'm going to walk away with this."

361
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 If you were to go on Yelp, you type in "Number 1 Colton Dallas,"

362
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 you know what pops up? Watermark.

363
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 [laughter]

364
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Let me just say, thank you all for your support in getting us to number one.

365
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 [laughter]

366
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 It wasn't easy, and we kept fighting.

367
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 But think about that. Think about if somebody actually believed that,

368
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 and they were like, "Oh, man, they're crazy. They're doing snakes. They're drinking Kool-Aid.

369
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 It's just nuts." And they were like, "Man, I'm not going to that church."

370
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And it's gossip, and it's toxic.

371
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And you know what's crazy?

372
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Those words were not written by somebody who's not a Christian.

373
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 There aren't atheists out there going like, "Oh, yeah, you know, it's a cult."

374
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Those are written by Christians who are hurt for whatever reason,

375
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 and hurt people hurt people.

376
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And hurt people, God says, are called to move towards people,

377
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 and to love people, and to listen to people, and to care for people,

378
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 and to be united with people.

379
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And so it leads to a poison perspective, and then finally,

380
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 it leads to a corruption of your character.

381
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Proverbs 11, verse 12 and 13, "A gossip goes telling secrets,

382
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 but those who are trustworthy can keep a confidence."

383
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 In other words, a gossip is someone who is not worthy of trust.

384
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 If somebody is gossiping to you, you need to know they will gossip about you.

385
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And you may feel like, "No, they wouldn't. We're so close."

386
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Yes, they would.

387
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 They've revealed, according to the Scripture, they're not someone who's trustworthy.

388
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And it corrupts your character.

389
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 The Scripture says that the first example of gossip was Satan.

390
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Why do I say that? Well, a couple reasons.

391
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 One, the first example of somebody talking bad about someone behind their back

392
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 was Satan in the garden with Adam and Eve, to Eve,

393
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 when they're sitting by a tree, and he says,

394
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 "You know, did God really say, 'Don't eat the fruit'?

395
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Are we sure that He doesn't have some other motive going on

396
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 and doesn't want to keep good from you?

397
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 I bet it's because He's holding out.

398
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 He can't be trusted."

399
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Furthermore, do you know what the Greek word for the devil is

400
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 in the New Testament, written in Greek?

401
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Diabolos.

402
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Diabolos.

403
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 It's a word that literally means "to cut through."

404
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Its Greek translation is "slanderer."

405
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 In other words, you read literature of Aristotle or different people

406
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 that you read the cliff notes for in high school,

407
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 you read their work, and the word that they use for slander is diabolos,

408
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 which literally means "dia," "to cut through," "bolos," "to separate."

409
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 He's the one who comes to separate, to divide, to create division.

410
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And any time we gossip, that is exactly what Satan wants you to do.

411
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Not talk to people, talk about them, create division,

412
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 and destroy relationships, which is the result of gossip.

413
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Finally, I'm going to move quick.

414
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 We've got to do the removal of gossip.

415
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 How do we remove gossip?

416
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Well, first, I think an important aspect of this is you've got to be able to recognize it,

417
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 because a lot of Christians, it's hard to know, like, what's in bounds?

418
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 What's gossip? When am I gossiping?

419
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 How do I, you know, vent, seek counsel?

420
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 What am I supposed to do?

421
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Can I not talk to anybody about anything?

422
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 How do I do that?

423
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And I want to unpack as best I can some of the aspects of what the Bible says is in bounds,

424
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 out of bounds, what are the instructions as it relates to gossip.

425
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And to do so, I'll explain it like this.

426
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 This past Sunday, I went to a Stars game with my son.

427
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 First Stars game, all-time.

428
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 There he is, hanging out with a puck, cloud nine,

429
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 slept with the puck that night, true story.

430
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 And we're there at the game.

431
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 He's so pumped.

432
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And I'd never been to a hockey game before.

433
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I don't know, just being from Houston, it's not something we did.

434
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And so I'm at the game, and they have all these rules.

435
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And I knew things existed in hockey that I didn't quite understand,

436
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 but they begin to call these fouls, like, man, that's off sides.

437
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 And somebody's yelling, like, icing, icing.

438
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And I'm like, what is--I know it's not on the cake, icing.

439
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 There's something else going on here.

440
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And I asked somebody for an explanation of what are the different rules.

441
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 What's inbounds? What's off sides?

442
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 What's all that mean? And they begin to explain.

443
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 So maybe this is for the person in the room who, like me,

444
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 doesn't understand hockey, doesn't understand the rules.

445
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Here's what it means to ice. Here's off sides.

446
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Off sides, you enter into the offensive zone before they're icing.

447
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 You hit it all the way down when there's no one there.

448
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Who made these rules? I don't know.

449
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But what's my point?

450
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 My point is that in order to play the game,

451
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 in order to not be in the penalty zone,

452
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 you've got to understand the rules.

453
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 You've got to understand the instructions.

454
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And many Christians don't understand the instructions.

455
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And so from the Scripture, I want to walk through four principles

456
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 as it relates to recognizing gossip and removing it.

457
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 So let me give you a few questions before I give you those four

458
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 that may help identify, man, I think I'm in gossip.

459
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Is your conversation with friends about another person

460
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 intended to prepare you for a productive conversation with that person?

461
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 If not, it's probably gossip.

462
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 If you're seeking counsel from others on how to deal wisely,

463
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 because that's the challenge.

464
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 We're like, man, am I venting? I'm getting counsel?

465
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 What would you do?

466
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 If you're seeking counsel from other people on how to do wisely,

467
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 do you attempt as best you can to keep the person's name a secret?

468
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 If not, it's probably gossip.

469
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Is the tone of your voice and the posture of your heart

470
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 humble, brokenhearted over sharing another person's sin?

471
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Or do you feel frustration and need to vent

472
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 and even a little bit justified in how could they?

473
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 If so, it's probably gossip.

474
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Finally, are you talking to God about this person

475
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 more than you're talking to anyone else?

476
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 If not, it may be gossip.

477
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 So let me give four steps as it relates to identifying and removing gossip.

478
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Number one, Christians talk to people, not about people.

479
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 That we talk to people.

480
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 If you have an offense against someone in your life,

481
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 in your friendship, in their believer,

482
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 you go to them.

483
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 You talk to people, not about people.

484
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Ephesians chapter four says,

485
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 "Do not let anything unwholesome come out of your mouth,

486
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 "but only what is helpful,

487
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 "for building others up according to their needs,

488
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 "that it may benefit those who listen."

489
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 That I talk to them directly for the purpose

490
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 of communicating what was done, how I felt, what was hurt,

491
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 for the purpose of building one another up

492
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 and strengthening, building that relationship.

493
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 If I'm talking to somebody else about a hurt that I have towards Josiah,

494
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 I am sinning if I'm not willing to go to my brother

495
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 and communicate that.

496
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Christians talk to people, not about people.

497
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Number two, we talk only to people who are part of the problem

498
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 or the solution.

499
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 You talk only to those who are part of the problem or the solution.

500
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 That if they're not a part of resolving that conflict

501
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 or resolving and addressing that hurt,

502
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 then they shouldn't be a part of the conversation.

503
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Maybe they're speaking into your life and they're providing wise counsel,

504
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 which would mean they're a part of the solution.

505
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 But I've got to make sure that when I'm going

506
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 and I'm seeking counsel on how to handle things,

507
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 I'm looking for people who will give me a bigger perspective,

508
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 not validate what I'm saying.

509
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 I'm looking for people who go,

510
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 "I know that he didn't call you when he said he was going to call you,

511
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 "but perhaps there's something else going on,

512
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 "and maybe you should seek more understanding on what happened there."

513
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Not the guy who goes, "Yeah, what a jerk, man.

514
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 "Unbelievable. He didn't call you?

515
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 "You should delete his number right now."

516
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And that's not helpful, that I need people and you need people.

517
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And I can know if it's venting or I'm getting wise counsel.

518
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 If everything that they say is valid, yes, and it's feeding the fire.

519
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 We talk people who are part of the problem and the solution.

520
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Jesus says in Matthew 18, verse 15,

521
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 "You should be very calculated on how you handle dealing with offenses against you,

522
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 "and you should be very narrow in the path that you take in terms of approaching it."

523
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 He says this, "If your brother or sister sins,

524
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 "go point out their fault just between the two of you.

525
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 "If they listen, you've won them over.

526
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 "If they will not listen, take one or two others along

527
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 "so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

528
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 "If they still refuse, then widen the circle more to the church,"

529
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 or in that context would have been akin to a small group.

530
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 "If they refuse to listen, then treat them as you would a pagan or tax collector."

531
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 How did Jesus treat pagans and tax collectors? He loved them.

532
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And so then you treat them like, "Man, I'm going to still love you,

533
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 "but I'm calling you and I'm identifying something that,"

534
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 collectively we're going, "This was wrong and this was in sin,

535
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 "and we're not going to hold you accountable if you don't want to be held accountable anymore,

536
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 "but I'm going to go to you and I'm going to talk with people who are part of the problem or the solution."

537
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Jesus says, "Do it privately, repeatedly, and widen the circle only as necessary."

538
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 People will say this, and I have said it before, and it's wrong.

539
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 They'll say, "Look, I'm saying this," and look, I would say this to their face if they were here.

540
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 It's still gossip, even if you would say it to their face if they were there.

541
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And so you should not say it when they're not there,

542
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 and you should go say it to their face when they are.

543
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 And Jesus says, "We talk to people, not about people.

544
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 "We talk to people who are part of the problem or the solution."

545
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And if somebody comes to you and shares gossip, you should ask them this question,

546
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 "Why are you telling me this?"

547
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 In fact, let me save that for a second and go to the third one.

548
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 The third one is, "We ask forgiveness when we fail."

549
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Because there's going to be times where I accidentally brought something up,

550
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 and I said, you know, "Sam, JD," or, you know.

551
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 I mentioned a comment, and when that happens, I need to pick up the phone,

552
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 or I need to go find them and say, "Hey, I just need you to know.

553
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 "I said this behind your back, and I should have said it to you.

554
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 "Will you please forgive me?"

555
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 That when we fail, we ask for forgiveness, and we will.

556
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 That's why we need a Savior. That's why Jesus came.

557
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And number four, "We don't tolerate"--perhaps the most broadly important,

558
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 widely applicable in the entire room is we do not tolerate gossip from other people.

559
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 You know what gossip always has in common? Two people.

560
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 And if you're listening to gossip, you're gossiping.

561
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 You don't have to be the dispenser of the tea.

562
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 If you're consuming it, you're gossiping.

563
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 And as Christians, we can go, "I'm not going to be safe for your gossip."

564
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 You can bring that up, and I'm going to ask a question, "What do you want me to do with that?

565
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 "Do you want to go together and talk to them?

566
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 "Are you asking me to give you some counsel right now?

567
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 "Because I'm not going to sit here and allow this to poison the perspective that I have on that person."

568
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Because we don't tolerate gossip.

569
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Titus 3--I don't have time to go into it, but Paul basically says,

570
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 "A divisive person in church has three strikes."

571
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Correct him once, 3 verses 10 and 11.

572
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Correct him twice. If he doesn't listen, then he should not be a part of the body.

573
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 In Proverbs 26, it says, "A fire goes out without wood,

574
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 "and gossip, without it, a conflict dies down."

575
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 He's basically saying, "Hey, Christians have a responsibility

576
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 "to not start the fire and be like a lighter.

577
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 "We have a responsibility to be like a fire extinguisher."

578
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And a lot of us in the room, like, "You're not just a lighter.

579
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 "You are like a lighter fluid. You are a flamethrower on stuff.

580
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 "And you're just stirring it up, and I can't believe."

581
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 And those of us who want to do what Jesus says have a responsibility.

582
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 When somebody comes to gossip and they say,

583
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 "Hey, I can't believe this happened," or, "Man, you're not going to believe what I heard,"

584
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 then we go, "Whoosh, whoosh, and I'm not going to tolerate it."

585
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 When I came to Watermark, I saw something modeled for the very first time

586
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 that I honestly had never seen before over a decade ago.

587
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 I came on staff, and I said a comment one day.

588
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 It's the first year of work, first maybe month of work,

589
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 and I made a comment about the way somebody was or the way that they had hurt me.

590
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 And the person I was with said, "Hey, let me stop you. Have you told them that?"

591
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 And I said, "No, you know, no."

592
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And he said, "Okay, you've got 24 hours,

593
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 "and if in 24 hours you haven't told them that, then I'm going to tell them that,

594
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 "and we're going to go together, and I'm going to make sure that he knows,

595
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 "that now I know, that he thinks that you've hurt him

596
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 "or you don't care about him in that regard."

597
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And it did something really interesting on our staff.

598
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 It made gossip not safe, because people began to go,

599
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 "Oh, my gosh, can you believe that? Oh, no, oh, no, I don't want to go, I don't want to go."

600
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And people began to go, "I don't want to go do that."

601
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 In a beautiful, healthy way, people began to recognize,

602
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 "Oh, man, gossip is toxic, it's poison,

603
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 "and we have a loving responsibility to one another that I'm going to call you

604
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 "and remind you to do that."

605
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 So much of your life, sadly, and my life,

606
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 has been lived through the lens of a poisoned perspective,

607
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 that you listen to the words that somebody else said about someone else,

608
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 and you believe that, and now you see them that way.

609
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 And they may not even still see them that way.

610
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 God says that followers of Christ have been adopted in the family of Jesus.

611
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 When people, or if people were to talk bad about my children,

612
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 I would have an emotional response of indignation or anger,

613
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 because, "How dare you talk about my princess daughter like that?"

614
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 It makes sense when you think God says that you are the sons and daughters of God.

615
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 Every time that you gossip as Christians,

616
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 you are talking about one of the children of God.

617
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 What response do you think a good, loving, heavenly Father would have?

618
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 In conclusion, the reasons we gossip flow from the heart.

619
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 The result is broken relationships, a poisoned perspective,

620
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 and the removal happens one step at a time.

621
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 There was one occasion, and I'll land the plane here,

622
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 where Jesus prays something really unique,

623
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 and he does so when he brings up you.

624
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 And by that, I don't mean he brings up Carl or Kyle.

625
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 He brings up future believers in the church,

626
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 and he talks about you behind your back.

627
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And I want to look at what he says.

628
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 It's in the context of John 17, and he prays,

629
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 and he brings up praying for his disciples,

630
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 and then he says, "I want to pray for anyone down the road who will ever believe."

631
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 And look at what he prays.

632
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 "I'm not only praying for these disciples,"

633
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 verse 20 of chapter 17, John,

634
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 "but also for all who will ever believe in me through their message, through the gospel."

635
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 That's the death and resurrection of Christ.

636
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 That's anyone who is trusted.

637
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Jesus died on the cross for their sin, paid for all of it, past, present, future.

638
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 He came back alive, showing the check cleared.

639
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Anyone who accepts that message, I want to pray for.

640
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 That's what he just said.

641
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 And look at what he prays next.

642
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 "I pray that they will all be one.

643
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 They will be united just as you, God, and I are," Jesus speaking.

644
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 "As you are in me and I am in you,

645
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 I pray that they would be in us so the world will believe you sent me.

646
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 I've given them the glory you gave me so that they may be one as we are.

647
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 I'm in them and you're in me.

648
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 May they experience such," look at this, "such perfect unity."

649
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Why? "That the world will know you sent me," Jesus,

650
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 "and that you love them as much as you love me."

651
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 God, would you allow them to be so united together

652
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 that relationships wouldn't be divided like the enemy wants to happen?

653
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 They'd be so united, so for each other, so pursuing each other,

654
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 so believing the best about each other, so connected together,

655
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 that the world would look on and go,

656
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 "You guys are so different from everybody else.

657
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Everyone else is in conflict. Everyone else is fighting.

658
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Everyone else negatively interprets.

659
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Everyone else assumes the worst.

660
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Everyone else gossips behind their back, and yet you guys stand out."

661
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 The only rational explanation is the thing that you have in common,

662
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 which is Jesus, and the world will see the Savior of the world.

663
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Gossip, ironically, it's the opposite of Christ-like love.

664
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Gossip is saying, "And I hold their sins against them."

665
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Do you believe that? Do you believe what they did?

666
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Jesus says, "I don't hold your sins against you."

667
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 The gossip says, "Man, I am strong because they're weak."

668
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 And Jesus, in Christianity, says that as believers in Christ,

669
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 we get to declare, "I am weak, but my God is strong."

670
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 And because of that, I'm not defined by what people think.

671
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 I'm not defined by my past mistakes,

672
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 and I'm not going to define you by yours.

673
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And I'm going to run towards you in love and truth and not gossip,

674
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 because we rest in peace to gossip.

675
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Let me pray.

676
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 Father, I thank you that you modeled perfectly.

677
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 If anyone could have come up and shown, pointed out all the sins

678
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 and the wrongs and errors of people, it's the perfect Son of God.

679
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 And yet, on this earth, you modeled patience, love, kindness.

680
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 And I pray for anyone in the room who has not had a moment

681
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 where they stepped into that relationship with you,

682
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 that first and foremost, above any instructions on gossip,

683
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 they would receive the gift that you offered.

684
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 I pray that you would allow friends here who need to go ask for forgiveness from people

685
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 because they have gossips, to take that step.

686
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 I pray for relationships that maybe haven't talked in months or years

687
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 would be restored and reconciled through the power of your Spirit,

688
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 just working and softening hearts and moving people together.

689
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 I pray that your church would be united

690
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 and that we would do everything as far as it depends on us

691
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 to be people who run towards each other in love and speak the truth and not gossip.

692
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 We worship you now in song. Amen.

693
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,500
 Amen.
