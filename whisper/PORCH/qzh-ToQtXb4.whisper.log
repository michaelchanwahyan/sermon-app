[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940]   Your lies be old me the kid my parents wanted me to be all the ways the world hurt me
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.560]   Goodbye to my fears and anxiety the reason why my ex left me rest in peace to the old me
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:35.200]   All right, well, hey welcome everybody in the room welcome all the ports live locations
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   Greater Lafayette Indianapolis Des Moines Cincinnati Tulsa North Houston we are continuing this series RIP to the old me
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.200]   Now today is February 15th which means yesterday was Valentine's Day
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200]   Valentine's Day means a lot of things to a lot of different people
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   Let me let you into my world on Valentine's I've been married almost 10 years
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200]   And so what I'm about to tell you I should have known better
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.200]   But my wife and I had a baby a couple weeks ago, and when you do that, thank you. Yes
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.200]   When that happens people generally set up a meal train which just means people will drop off food or send Uber Eats or do different things
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.200]   And my wife last week said hey on Monday Valentine's Day a friend of ours and her husband were going to drop off food
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200]   Should we tell them to cancel it's Valentine's Day
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.200]   Now I thought she was being very considerate about this other couple who was married
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.200]   And how they shouldn't be spending Valentine's Day dropping off food to us
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.200]   We can just Uber Eats it'll be fine
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   And I said no tell them they don't need to bring food on Valentine's Day
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.200]   The next day comes by she's like are you sure you want me to tell them you know it's Valentine's Day
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   I'm like yeah it's Valentine's Day tell them not to bring food
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   Sunday comes and she says so what are we doing tomorrow
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   And I say well you said a few days ago you didn't want to do anything on Valentine's Day
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   Now hold on hold on hold on
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   Man this is really important
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   No matter how many times or in how many ways they tell you I don't want to do anything on Valentine's Day
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   They are sitting on a throne of lies
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   Because they don't mean that at all
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   And I said well I thought you said you didn't want to do anything
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   You were like yeah but you said cancel food I assumed we were going to do something
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   And I immediately went into yeah we're going to do something for sure
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   And so I come up with a plan of what we're going to do for Valentine's
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   We're going to go find a patio sit outside it's going to be great
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   Now what does that have to do with tonight and why do I bring that up
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   Because Valentine's Day you know is one of those days that can be a day of disappointment
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   For some people it can be a day of excitement
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   For new couples in the room that just started dating you're so thrilled that he showed up
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   And he brought you some candies you brought some chocolates
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   When you think Valentine's you may think some of the things that we grew up thinking
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Like that stuffed teddy bear that somebody dropped off your junior year in high school
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   Or flowers he had sent to work that he paid way too much to send flowers
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   Is ten times more than to buy them at the grocery store
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   But he sent them anyways because that's what he is
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   Or maybe you think back to you know elementary school
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   When they would hand out the most disgusting chocolate candy of all time
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   I don't know what it is for you maybe for you it really is at Galentine's
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   And you just think man I'm going to just go out with the girls
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   And I don't even want to and I'm going to go home and replay episodes of The Bachelor
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   I don't know what it is but there's a lot of different things associated with it
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   Sometimes it's disappointment in fact I'm going to give some of these
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   Who's single guys in the room right here?
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   Any single guys? Alright bro shoot your shot man
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   You single? Alright man
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   Another single guy
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   I'm not giving away a card that's just pathetic
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   Alright chocolates these look like gourmet chocolates
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   Alright all you guys need to stand up right now and pick a girl
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   And I'm just kidding by the end
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   What if we did? Get the camera
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   By the end of the night you need to give those to somebody else
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   Don't eat those chocolates they're not for you or the chocolate candy
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   But on Valentine's whether you had a great day or you had a disappointing day
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   One thing that all of us share in common is this desire for love
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   This desire to have a relationship
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   This desire to have a connection with someone of the opposite sex
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   That hopefully someday maybe leads us into marriage
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   And the disappointment maybe you felt or some people do feel on Valentine's Day is one thing
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   But to have a love life that ends in disappointment is an entirely other thing
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   And one of the more important decisions you're going to make in this stage of life
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   Is deciding who you're going to date and then eventually for most of you
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   Who you're going to marry
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   And we're talking in this series about RIP to the old me
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   Rest in peace to the old me
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   What does that mean?
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   Well the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5 verse 17
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   That when you put your faith in Jesus
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   What he did on the cross, dying for your sin, rising from the grave
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   That moment you came to faith you became a new person
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   An old you is gone and a new life has begun and was born
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.200]   And now as a Christian life we live out that new life
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   So that's this whole series walking through what it looks like to live out the new life
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   And live out new ways
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   And one of the ways we're going to talk about tonight
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   Is related to dating
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   Specifically tonight's topic is RIP to toxic dating
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   How to stop dating toxically
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   How to say RIP, rest in peace, to toxic dating
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   And the chatter in the room only reflects the fact that a lot of us
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   Have experienced some toxic dating
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   And what I know all of us have in common
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   Is that none of us wants to have a relationship that is dysfunctional
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   That's toxic
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   That ends in heartbreak
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   And the good news is God doesn't want that for you either
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   And in scripture he lays out principles and teachings and instructions
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   That we can learn from and apply
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   As it relates to how we navigate the waters of dating if you will
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   So tonight I want to talk about a couple ways
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   That is to play itself out
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   How to stop dating toxically
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   And look at two observations from the life of one of the most famous men in the Old Testament
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   This was a man named Samson
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   And Samson, when you think of his name
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   You guys are on another level tonight man
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   There's generally a couple words that come to mind
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.200]   And one of them is another name
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   And it's the name of the most famous woman in his life
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   And her name was Delilah
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   Hey there Delilah
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   And Delilah and his relationship
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   Really Samson's life in general gives us some key takeaways
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   About how to avoid by looking at his life and seeing what not to do
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   Because he is an example of toxic love if you will
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   And so we're going to walk through some of his story
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   And we're going to be in the book of Judges chapter 16
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.200]   Now the book of Judges, if you have a Bible you can flip open there
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   If not it will be up on the screen
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   And you'll get a high level overview of both Judges and Samson
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.200]   The book of Judges is a time where Judges were the leaders of Israel
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   God would appoint a judge
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   And don't think Judge Judy gown and gavel
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   Think the Avengers if you will
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   Because each of these, throughout it you've got Gideon who's like Ant-Man
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.200]   You've got Deborah who's Wonder Woman
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.200]   And then you've got our boy Samson who would be the Hulk
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   And Samson is born to a couple
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   Who had spent years and years and years unable to have children
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   And an angel shows up to the mother, or Samson's mother
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.200]   And says you are going to have a baby boy
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   God has heard your prayer, here's what you need to know about him
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   The angel's telling her
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   He will be set apart from birth
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   He will be distinct from all other people in the nation
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   And he will be set apart and be a Nazarite
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   In other words he will be a part of this unique group that's taking a vow to God
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   And in his life he is to not have any exposure or to drink any alcohol
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   He's not to have any exposure to anything dead or dead bodies
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   And he is to not ever cut his hair
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   And God is going to use him to deliver the nation of Israel
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   And his mom is ecstatic and overjoyed
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   And we're also told something else
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   He's going to have superhuman strength
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   Unlike anybody else in the Old Testament, which is why I said the Hulk
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   But despite having this unbelievable strength
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   Samson had a weakness for the ladies
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   And it would be that weakness that would take this incredibly he-man
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   And turn him into a picture of weakness
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   And in his story we learn about the ways that toxic dating can take out an entire life
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   As we're going to see in his journey
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   Samson is a guy that has a story where we're going to pick up
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   In his story is with his relationship with Delilah
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   But here's what you got to know about Samson
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   He's already had 20 years by this point
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   Where he has not lived in accordance with who God says he was supposed to be
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   God had given him this incredible strength and he had squandered on himself
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   His first marriage had fallen apart
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   He dated a woman that was a Philistine
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   Basically like the enemies of the nation of Israel at that time
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   And he said, you know what, I got a good idea
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   I'm going to date one of our enemy's daughters
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.200]   He marries her and then he's not a good guy
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   He's kind of a jerk, picks a fight with the Philistines
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.200]   And they pick a fight back and they kill his wife and his father-in-law
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   Burn them alive
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   And Samson just continues to pick fights with these people
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   At one point, because he's so sexually unrestrained
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   He goes and sleeps with a prostitute
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   And he's just a picture of a wreck
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   And so by the time we pick up the story with Delilah
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   The narrator or the author is writing us to show
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   A story that makes you go, this is unbelievable
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   How could this happen?
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   And it's because of the ways that he compromised
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   And did not decide, I'm going to follow the ways of God
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   He decided, I'm going to follow the ways of me
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   I'm not going to pursue the desires of God's heart
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   I'm going to pursue the desires of my heart
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   And it led to destruction
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   So we're going to pick up in verse 4 and I'll walk through
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.200]   "Sometime later, he," that's Samson
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.200]   "Fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   Whose name was Delilah"
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   So he falls in love with a valley girl named Delilah
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.200]   "Who was not among the people of God"
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.200]   That's with the valley of Sorek
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   Basically another Philistine girl
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   So when God said, she is not who you are to be in love with
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   Or to date or to marry
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   "And the rulers of the Philistines went to her"
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   That's again the enemy of the people of God
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.200]   "The rulers come to her"
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   The enemy of Samson
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   "And they said, 'See if you can lure him
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   Into showing you the secret of his great strength
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   And how we can overpower him
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   So we may tie him up and subdue him
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   And each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels'"
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.200]   So Samson at this point in the story, in chapters past
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   He had, with a donkey bone jaw
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.200]   Or the bone of a donkey bone
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   The bone of a donkey bone
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.200]   The bone of a donkey jaw
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   Had just killed a thousand Philistines
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   So these guys are getting tired and fed up
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   Of this one guy with supernatural power
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   And supernatural strength
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   And they finally go to his girlfriend now at the time
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   And say, "We will give you eleven hundred shekels each"
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   There's five of them
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   "What's that equivalent to today?"
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   Between fifteen and thirty million dollars
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.200]   They basically say, "We will give you enough money
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   To retire for the rest of your life
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   To get the house
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   You will be good
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   If you can find out how we can lure and trap Samson"
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   So Delilah is a gold digger
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   Probably the earliest example of a gold digger
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   And she says, then to Samson
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   After agreeing to do it
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   "Tell me the secret of your great strength
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   How can you be tied up and subdued?"
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   And Samson answers her
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   At this point you've got to think
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   Bro, what are you thinking?
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   She just said, "Hey, you know, hypothetically
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   If someone's going to try to kill you
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   But he's in love
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.200]   And what happens when you're in love
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.200]   It doesn't matter what they say
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   You make excuses, you justify it
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   He's doing what you do whenever you're in love
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   You allow the other person more rope
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   Than they really should have
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   Because you can't see clearly
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   You're in love, it's what love does
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   And Samson doesn't give her the right answer
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.200]   He makes up a lie and he says
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   "If anyone ties me with seven fresh bow strings
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   That have not been dried
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   I will become as weak as any other man"
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   Now why he made this up, we're not really told
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.200]   But he basically makes up something and says
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   "If anybody ties me up, I'll become as weak"
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   So then the rulers of the Philistines
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   Brought her seven fresh bow strings
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   That had not been tied
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   With men hidden in his room
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.200]   He goes to sleep
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   And while he's lying there on the bed
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   She ties him up
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   And then she said
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!"
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200]   And he got out of bed
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.200]   And he snapped the bow strings
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   As if a string snaps when it comes close to a flame
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   We've all been there before, right?
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   So the secret of his strength
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   Was not discovered
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   Then Delilah said to Samson
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   "You've made a fool of me
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   You lied to me
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.200]   Come now, tell me how you can be tied"
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   And so he answers her again
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   Gives her another answer
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   Next night comes, he goes to bed
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   Because he's sleeping and staying at her house
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   And he basically says
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   "No, you actually got to tie me up with new ropes"
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   And so he goes to sleep
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.200]   And she ties him up with new ropes
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.200]   And then she comes in and says
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   "Samson, the Philistines are here!"
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   And he jumps out of bed
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   And again, he breaks it and snaps it
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   Like it was nothing
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   And then she says again
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   "Man, you've made a fool of me
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   How can you do this?"
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   And he says
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   "You know what it is?
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   You've got to weave my hair
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   You've got to put my hair in a weave
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   And that will make me as weak as any other man"
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   And of course he's lying to her again
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   And she does it
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   And you read the story and you're like
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   "This is the most...
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   How at some point, Samson, did you not stop and go
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   'Wait a second
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   Every time I go to bed
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   You keep doing the thing that I said was the thing
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   That would make me be able to be subdued'?"
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   But when you think about it
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   It's not that far off
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   From what some of us
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   If others were looking at our story would say
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   "Wait a second!
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.200]   You guys, he treated you so poorly
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   And you're dating again?
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   After she cheated on you
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   You guys are back together?
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   After all the different times that she lied
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   And you had his phone
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   And he was like texting that other girl
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   And it wasn't like just
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.200]   "Hey, are you done with that assignment yet?"
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   I mean
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   And as easy as it is to see with Samson
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   Some of us
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   If people could look into our life
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   They would go
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   "How did you find yourself there?"
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   And this is why love is such an important topic
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   Because it does something to the heart
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   You can fall in love with someone that doesn't have character
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   That doesn't have your faith
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   That can lead you away from God
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   And that's exactly where Samson is
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   And he lies to her again
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   And he wakes up
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.200]   The weave doesn't work
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   And he breaks free
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   And then she says this
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   She goes full scale manipulation Mary right here
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   She says
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   "How can you say I love you
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   When you don't confide in me?
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   This is the third time you've made a fool of me
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.200]   And haven't told me the secret of your great strength"
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   With such nagging
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   That's in the Bible
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.200]   She prodded him
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   Day after day
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   Until he was sick to death of it
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   So it becomes all that they talk about
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   So the sex wasn't working to get the secret out of him
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   So now she just nags
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   And every time he comes home
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   She's just weeping about
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   "You still won't tell me the secret"
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   And then when he goes off to work
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   Or he comes back
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   She's still sitting there in sackcloth and ashes
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   And just moping
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   And eventually Samson
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   It says he goes
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   "Oh this is driving me insane
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   I'll just tell you already"
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   And so he told her everything
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   "No razor has ever been used on my head
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   Because I have been a Nazarite
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   Dedicated to God
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   From my mother's womb
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   I was born a special child
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   And God had a special purpose and plan for my life"
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   I wonder if when he's saying this to this woman
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.200]   Who's a woman he wasn't supposed to be in a relationship with
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   A woman that he's sexually immoral with
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   I wonder if any of it's flashing through his mind
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   "Oh yeah, an angel showed up at my birth
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   God had a purpose
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   And his hand on me
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   From before I was even born
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   And I've used it and squandered it
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   To pursue my pleasure
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   Not my purpose"
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   He says
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   "I've never had a haircut my entire life
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   And if my head was shaved
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   My strength would leave me
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   And I would be as weak as any other man
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   When Delilah saw he had told her everything
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   She sent word to the rulers of the Philistines
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   Come back once more
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   He's told me everything
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   So the rulers of the Philistines
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.200]   Returned with silver in their hands
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   After putting him to sleep on her lap"
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   This girl is poison
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.200]   "She called for someone to shave off
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   The seven braids of his hair
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   And so began to subdue him
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.200]   And his strength left him
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   Then she called, 'Samson, the Philistines are upon you'
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   He awoke from sleep and thought
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.200]   'I'll go out as before
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   Shake myself free'
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   But he did not know
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.200]   The Lord had left him
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.200]   Then the Philistines seized him
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   And they gouged out his eyes
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.200]   And they took him down to Gaza"
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   Just another city
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   "They bound him with bronze shackles
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   And they set him to grinding grain in the prison
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   But the hair on his head
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   Began to grow again
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   After it had been shaved"
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   We're going to come back to that verse
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   I mean, this is a tragic story
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   And it's meant to be a tragic story
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   You think about Samson in that moment
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   It would have to be the worst day of his life
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.200]   As he's bound up, as he realizes
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   After living his whole life
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   With unbelievable strength
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   That the spirit of God was no longer
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   Rippling through his body
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   And he was as weak as any other man
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   And maybe one of the last sights that he saw
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   Was Delilah before they gouged his eyes out
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   And he passed out and he woke up shackled
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   And realized, it's not just dark in here
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   I can't see
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   My eyes are gone
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   And this man who had such incredible strength
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.200]   That weakness would lead to his downfall
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   And I think God has you here tonight
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   Because he does not want
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   The train wreck of the romantic life that Samson had
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   And some of the things that he engaged in
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   To be a part of your story
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   And lead to a train wreck in your life
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   And there's two things that I really want to pull out
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   And camp on
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   Because they just make up a simple component
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   Of what it looks like to stop dating toxically
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   And we see it
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   And it's easy to see from the outset
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.200]   But the first thing I want to talk about
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.200]   Is stop dating the wrong people
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   Stop dating the wrong people
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   Now how do I know if they're the wrong person?
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   Because nobody in here is like
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   You know what, I like dating the wrong person
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   Everyone's looking for Mr. Right or Mrs. Right
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   One of the ways we see from the story
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   Is don't date toxic people
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   No matter how beautiful
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   No matter how amazing
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.200]   Or how much relational or emotional equity you have
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   If they have toxic traits
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   You have a toxic relationship
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   And candidly, if you're attracted to someone with toxic traits
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.200]   You've got some toxic traits you need to work on yourself
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.200]   Inside of the story we see Samson
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   I mean look at some of the traits that he has
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   He's selfish
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.200]   He's using her
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.200]   And sleeping with her
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   He's impulsive
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   And he's just raffling off
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   Just oh you should do this, you should do this
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   He's, honestly he's dumb
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   He's so drunk in love that he can't see straight
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.200]   He's angry
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   We're told earlier that because he basically picked a fight
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.200]   Or he lost a riddle
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.200]   Samson liked to play games
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   Another negative quality
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   He played a riddle that he basically lost with the Philistines
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200]   And in a temper tantrum
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   He goes and kills 30 guys to pay for his bet
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   He eventually gets so angry
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   That he catches these foxes and sets fire
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   To this farmland of a Philistine person
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   And he just deals with an anger problem
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   And this is really important girls
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Because there's something broken candidly
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   And I want, as gently as I can say that
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   He's attracted to the bad boy
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   And if you pursue a dating relationship
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   Or marry a bad boy
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   You are making a bad decision
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   Because they end up being someone
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   Whose character and that temper
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   That doesn't become fun at 3 in the morning
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   When you've got two kids crying
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   Whenever you're walking through financial challenges
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.200]   Which are just a part of life
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   Or a spouse that is sick
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.200]   Somebody having a temper and anger problem
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   Is not something that you want
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   And Samson's clearly got other issues
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   He's arrogant
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   I mean he thinks nobody can stop me
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   Even if I tell her there's nothing that she can do
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   I'm Samson
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.200]   He's sexually immoral
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   He's sleeping at her house
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   Previous chapter he slept with a prostitute
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   And candidly he's got a fake faith
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   I mean he was born and destined
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   To be a leader and deliverer of Israel
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   This is equivalent of the guy who says he's a Christian
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.200]   But doesn't act Christ-like
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.200]   And let me say, and now I'm about to go to the girls
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   With the qualities of Delilah
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   There are a lot of guys in this room
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   That say they're a Christian
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.200]   And they do not act Christ-like
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   And you should not date them
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   And you should be cautious
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   Because they've got a Bible and they go to the porch
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.200]   Does not mean they're not a wolf
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.200]   And if we find a wolf we will expose them
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   And we will do everything we can to make sure
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   That everyone is in a safe environment
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   Because we care deeply about that
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   So if you are a wolf you should know
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.200]   You are going to be exposed
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.200]   And you will not be welcome
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.200]   But we will care for you in other ways
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   But Samson's a guy who claims to be a Christian
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   But he doesn't act Christ-like
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   I mean he's not even supposed to be dating this girl
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.200]   He's not supposed to be picking fights
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.200]   That's not how you resolve conflict
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.200]   And then her, you get to her toxic traits
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   And in some ways it's almost like they were made for each other
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   Because you think about what she was
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.200]   She's controlling, she's manipulative
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   You said you love me
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   How dare you
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   I mean she's
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.200]   Using her body to manipulate
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   To control
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.200]   She's a gold digger
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.200]   She's selfish
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   She doesn't care about him
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.200]   She cares about the money that she will get
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   She's sexually immoral
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.200]   She's sleeping over at her house
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.200]   He falls asleep on her nap
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   My guess is he didn't just fall asleep
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   After having a cup of coffee
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   Something else probably
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.200]   She's dishonest
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   And she's not a woman of God
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   And by that I mean
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.200]   She was not a part of the people of God
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   God had commanded, which brings us to another
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.200]   How I know they're not the right person
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   She was not a part of the group of people
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   God said, hey these are the only people
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   That are eligible bachelors and bachelorettes
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   For my people
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   Among the nation of Israel you were to marry the people of God
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   Because if you marry foreign women you're going to go after foreign gods
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   And I want you to worship the one true God
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   And raise kids in a home where they worship the one true God
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   The same is true today
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   If you're a follower of Jesus
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   He has made abundantly clear in scripture
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   You are only to date Christians
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   Did you know since 2010
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   Four out of ten marriages have been between people
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   Of different religions
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.200]   Many of them Christians
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   Marrying someone who doesn't have a faith
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   Or Mormon or marrying someone who's Buddhist
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   Or marrying someone who's Islamic
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   And God over and over says
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   If you're following Jesus you are not to marry anyone outside
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   Of those who love Jesus
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   Not claim to be a Christian
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.200]   Not were raised Catholic
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.200]   Not go to church sometimes
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.200]   But they love Jesus
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.200]   Let me give you the verse
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.200]   Some of you guys write this down
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   Because this makes it abundantly clear
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   Here is who's in bounds and who's not
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   First Corinthians chapter 7 verse 39
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   They are free to marry anyone they wish
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.200]   But only
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.200]   If they love the Lord
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.200]   If they love the Lord
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.200]   How do I know if they love the Lord
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   How do you know if they love anything as we said before
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   How do you know if somebody loves a cowboy
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   Well they have season tickets
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   They're wearing the jersey
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   They know Dax stats
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   They're constantly making sacrifices
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   In order to know all that's going on
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   Because why do they love it
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   How do you know if somebody loves shopping
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   Or loves clothes
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   Well they're constantly budgeting for it
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   Or maybe they're not budgeting for it
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   And that's a reflection of kind of their life in general
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   They're constantly in new different outfits
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   They're willing to make sacrifices of their time
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   Their money themselves
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   So they're around you
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   And they talk about it
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.200]   They make sacrifices with their time
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   You call them to do something and they say
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   I can't I've actually got this discipleship group
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.200]   I've actually got this ministry thing that I'm taking a part of
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.200]   If that's not happening
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.200]   You should probably double click
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   And Paul says
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.200]   Only if they love Jesus
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   Are they an eligible person to date
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   In second Corinthians 6 he says the same thing
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   In other words do not be joined together with unbelievers
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   For what are righteousness and wickedness have in common
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   What fellowship can light have with darkness
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   Let me give you three quick reasons
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   This is really important
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   Number one if you marry someone who doesn't have your same faith
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   Three things are going to happen
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   Or at least a couple of these two things
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.200]   Two of the three are for sure going to happen
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   Either they are going to cap your intimacy with Jesus
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   Because they're not going to be pulling you to be involved at church
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   They're not going to be encouraging you to spend time in God's word
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.200]   They don't believe in that
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   Or
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   They're going to be pulling you to be involved in the church
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   They're not going to be encouraging you to spend time in God's word
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   Or
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   It's going to cap your intimacy with them
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   Why would I say that
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   The most intimate thing about you is what you believe
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   About God
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   About Jesus and the fact that you can't share that
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   With the person you share a bed with
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   And you make kids with
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   You don't think that's going to be a barrier
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   Which brings me to
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   One of the dangers for your children's sake
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   I mean some of you guys were raised in homes
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   Where you were a part of families
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   Where they got married and she was Jewish
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   And he was Baptist or whatever the scenario was
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   And it just created
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   You know what a lot of people experience
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   I experienced with my friend Sam who had parents
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   That were Jewish and Baptist and he was like
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   So basically I was confused
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   Because neither of them really believed
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   And that's where you're going to communicate
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   How are you going to make decisions on raising kids
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   When you're going to say as a Christian
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   Man God's word is going to inform us
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   But they don't believe God's word
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   And the third thing is
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.200]   Not even from the Bible it's from sociology
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.200]   But from the world according to studies
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   It makes you three times more likely to divorce
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   Than marrying someone with the same faith
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   Let me say that three times
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.200]   More likely to divorce
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   There was a study done in 2001 of 35,000
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   Participants of mixed religion marriages
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   And found three times more likely
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   Divorce is to take place
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.200]   From the American Religious
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.200]   Identification Survey
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   That's 75% of religious
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   Intermixed marriages end in divorce
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   And God
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   Who loves you as much as you love him
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.200]   And you care about him and he's a work in progress
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   Or she's a work in progress, she's smoking hot
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   Would say if he doesn't have your faith
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.200]   You are living in direct disobedience
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.200]   If you're dating him
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   Or if you're dating her
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   And candidly
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.200]   You are watering down
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   What following Jesus looks like
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   To someone who doesn't understand it
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   Finally
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.200]   What we also see
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   Actually
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.200]   There was a study done
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   An experiment
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   It was done in the 1990s
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   In India
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   It was an attempt to increase the breeding
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.200]   Of Asiatic lions
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   Now because most of us don't spend a lot of time
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.200]   Studying Asiatic lions
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   There are two primary types of lions
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   Those are African lions which is you know Mufasa
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   And then there's the Asiatic lions
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   And they have some subtle differences
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   What you may not know is Asiatic lions
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   That's in Asia are highly endangered
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   And because there are only about
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.200]   300 of them left they attempted to take
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   African lions and breed them with Asiatic lions
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   Hoping this will make
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.200]   You know a hybrid that will increase
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   The likelihood of the species surviving
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.200]   Only something
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   Terrible happened
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   They took these two lions and they made a hybrid
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.200]   And it was
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   Catastrophic
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   About 70 lions were produced as offspring
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   And
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   They were so
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   Immune deficient for whatever reason
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   They could barely eat
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   The hind legs
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   Of the new hybrid lions weren't strong
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   Enough to hold up the lions
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   And so these 70 lions they were described as just
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   Waiting to die some of them were so weak
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   They couldn't eat meat off the bone they had to be fed
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   Meat without a bone
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.200]   Here's a picture of them and they're basically
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   The last of them are dying off because
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   They're so
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   Sick
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   Unhealthy
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.200]   Broken
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   And what was a hope of oh this will be great
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.200]   And this will work out and it will be okay
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.200]   Was anything but okay
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   And that's a picture
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.200]   Of what happens often when our faith
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   When we marry and merge
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   Together with someone who doesn't share our faith
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   Doesn't share our beliefs
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   Doesn't lead to a flourishing healthy life
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.200]   It leads to dysfunction, brokenness
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   Lack of life
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.200]   And God loves you He doesn't want that for you
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   So the first way we stop toxic dating
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.200]   Is by saying no to the wrong people
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.200]   And saying yes to God's people
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   I wish I could go another 20 minutes about that point
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.200]   But I don't have time. Number two
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   Stop dating the wrong way
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   In this we see toxic love we see here's the relationship
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   That they have together they're sleeping together
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   They're playing married
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.200]   Where he's staying over at her house
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   They're using each other they're lying to each other
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   They're compromising for each other
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   They're pulling each other away from God
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   And they're dating in isolation
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.200]   And I always say sex could be a bad thing
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   And let me just
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   God invented sex we've talked so much about that
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.200]   Why would God in 1 Corinthians 6
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.200]   Say flee sexual morality
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   Don't do what Samson and Delilah did
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   Don't allow that to be a part of your relationship
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.200]   Is it because he's against sex
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   No he created it but he knows
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.200]   Outside of the context of marriage
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   It brings scars and pain into your life
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   Into my life
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.200]   1 Corinthians 6 says flee sexual morality
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.200]   Every other sin a person commits
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.200]   Against their own body whoever sins sexually
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.200]   Sins against their own body
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.200]   Do you not know your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   Who's in you
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   You were bought with a price
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   You are not your own honor God with your bodies
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.200]   God
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   Says you are so valuable Christ would give
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.200]   His life for you
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   Don't give that away
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   Cheaply
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   Sex was not meant to be
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   An appetizer I mean
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   Was meant to be dessert not an appetizer
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   And you know what happens
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   If you make it an appetizer
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   The person you're with
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   Is going to be less likely to stick around
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.200]   For the main course
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   Which is marriage
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   And you're so much more valuable than that
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   And you're going to bring into your life
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.200]   All kinds of pain and scars
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   Some of the deepest pains any of us carry or I carry
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   Are connected to sexual history
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   Pornography
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.200]   I was reading a book a couple years ago
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.200]   And it was about sharks and the mating patterns
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   Of sharks
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   Which is pretty random
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.200]   And it described how when a male shark
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   Mates with a female
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   It bites onto them
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.200]   It's how they hold on and grip
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.200]   And so you can tell the sexual history
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   Of a female shark based on the scars
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   That they have on the outside
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   So much so that a female shark has twice the thickness
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.200]   Of skin of a male shark
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.200]   And it described how for sharks
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   Scars reflect sex
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.200]   But that's not really just true with sharks
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   It's true for all of us
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   For many of us
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.200]   The deepest scars we carry are connected to sex
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   Sexual pain
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   Or sexual abuse
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.200]   Something that happens
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   A friend who was sexually abused by a family member
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   It's a scar
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.200]   A family that disintegrated after a dad's sexual sin came out
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   Scar
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.200]   A friend who got pregnant
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   After casually hooking up with a guy
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   And she got an abortion
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.200]   Because I'm not going to marry him
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.200]   Every year on that anniversary
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.200]   She weeps
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.200]   Scar
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.200]   A person who was like me
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   Exposed to pornography at 12
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.200]   That led to 10 years of addiction to pornography
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   Scar
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.200]   And God is so crazy about you
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   He would give his life for you
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.200]   He's not opposed to sex
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   He's opposed to scars
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   And you experiencing the fullness and the gift
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   That he intended sex to be in the car
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   And you experiencing the fullness and the gift
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   That he intended sex to be in the context of marriage
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.200]   A gift that Samson
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   And Delilah never got to experience
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   Finally dating in isolation
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   We're never told of anyone else being in their life
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.200]   It's only Samson and Delilah
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.200]   In fact the whole story, Samson lives in isolation
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.200]   If you're dating in isolation
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   You're going to experience dating not God's way
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.200]   Because you're dating in a way that
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   God says you're really not supposed to live life
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   As Christians
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.200]   We're to have other people speak into our life
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.200]   To help see those blind spots
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.200]   See the things that
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.200]   When you read Samson's story you see them all
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   And if somebody was to read your story
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   They'd see them all
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   But we can just be so blinded by
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.200]   The love and the
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.200]   Emotional connection we feel with that person
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.200]   God says you're to have people in your life
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.200]   That come alongside and encourage
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   And ask hard questions and they pray for you
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   And they challenge you
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.200]   And they support and care for you
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.200]   Proverbs 18 verse 1 says
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.200]   Whoever isolates themselves
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.200]   Seeks their own desires
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.200]   And they break out or they push back
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   Against all sound decision making
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   You and I are to date with other people in our life
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   Honoring each other and pursuing purity sexually
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   Honoring the marriage bed and not living together and moving in together
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.200]   And Samson and Delilah tragically give us a picture
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   Of what happens
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   When we decide I'm not going to pursue God's way
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   I'm going to pursue my way
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:39.200]   Now I said at the end
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   Samson
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   His hair begins to grow again
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.200]   And we're told that something else
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   Begins to happen soon
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.200]   He's sitting in that dungeon and he's blind
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.200]   And he can't see
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   But
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.200]   He's about to turn to God and pray
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   And it's the only time
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.200]   This is crazy
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   It's the only time we're told Samson ever prays
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   That he ever talks to God
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   Somehow the blindness physically
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   Led to sight spiritually
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.200]   For the first time
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.200]   And sitting in that dungeon
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   His hair began to grow back
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   And they are having a party
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   And remember he's under the arrest of the Philistines
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   And he's in that dungeon
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.200]   And they're having this big kegger basically
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   And there's three thousand people around
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   And in the party the Philistines are like
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   You know what would be awesome? Let's bring out Samson
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   You know Samson that guy who like killed all those people
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.200]   Like our enemy
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   We captured him bring him out
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   Let's have him perform
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   And it says that they were in high spirits
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   Verse 25
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   And they shouted bring out Samson to entertain us
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   So they called Samson out of the prison
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   And he performed for them
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   Verse 26
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.200]   And Samson who held his hand
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.200]   Put me where I can feel the pillars
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.200]   That support the temple
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   So that I may lean against them
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   Now the temple was crowded with men and women
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   And the rulers of the Philistines were there
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   And on the roof was three thousand men and women
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.200]   Watching Samson
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   And Samson prayed
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   Sovereign Lord
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   Remember me
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   Please God give me strength
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.200]   Just once more and let me
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   With one blow get revenge on the Philistine
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   For my two eyes
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   Then he reached towards
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   The two central pillars
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   On which the temple stood
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   Bracing himself against them
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   His right on one his left on the other
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   He said let me die with the Philistines
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.200]   And he pushed with all of his might
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   And down came the temple
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.200]   And all the rulers and the people
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   Thus he killed more when he died
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.200]   Than while he lived
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   Verse 31 says he had led Israel
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   For twenty years
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:59.200]   Despite having chosen rebellion for years and years
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   His story wasn't done
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   And he turned to God
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   And God honored that reflection
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.200]   And that repentance
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.200]   Even at the end
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   And he walked through them
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.200]   My hope
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   Is that you don't spend twenty years
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   Like Samson and find yourself at forty six
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   Or forty eight or forty nine
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.200]   Going what did I do?
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.200]   I just spent the last two decades
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   Living how I wanted to
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   Pursuing what I wanted to
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   And you decide what Samson didn't decide early in his life
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.200]   Eventually he got himself there
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   You decide God I'm going to trust you
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   I'm not going to decide to follow the ways of the world
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   I'm going to follow the ways of God's word
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.200]   And I'm going to actually date and pursue
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   The type of person you invite
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   And you tell me to look for
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   I'm not going to go from relationship to relationship
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.200]   And one night stands
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   And I'm also not going to buy the lie that God is done with you
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.200]   Because he's not done with you
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   As damaged of goods as you feel like you are right now
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.200]   Because some of you do
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   And you hear a godly guy or godly girl
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   And you think there's no way a godly guy is ever going to want me
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   You have bought a lie
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.200]   And the invitation to you is the invitation to anybody in this room
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   You've got to surrender
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.200]   And do what the Bible calls repentance
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   Relationally repent
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   God I'm not going to drive myself
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.200]   I'm giving you the keys to my love life
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   My married life
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   I'm going to trust you
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   I'm not going to date in isolation
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.200]   If I'm having sex right now
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   I'm going to make the decision
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   I'm getting out of this relationship
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   It's going to be painful, it's going to be hard
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   But I'm going to trust you God
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.200]   I'm going to take the steps to be the type of person that Samson wasn't
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.200]   I'm going to be a godly spouse
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   I'm going to focus on finding a godly spouse
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.200]   And do so in a godly way
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   And not end up
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   After 20 years
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   Coming to the place where Samson
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   Through all the pain and humiliation did
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.200]   And God loves you
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   And wants you to experience that
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   And let me close
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   Valentine's, you know I opened with it
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   And I'm laying on the plane here
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   Valentine's is a really interesting holiday
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   Because it's a holiday that has been around for
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.200]   1400 years
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   1600 years, since the 400's
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   It was instituted in celebration
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   Or commemoration of
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.200]   St. Valentinius, a pastor
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.200]   A priest from the first century, St. Valentin
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   He was a pastor
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.200]   That in 268 AD decided
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   I am going to willfully reject
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   The law, what was the law?
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   Well the emperor was not a believer, not a Christian
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.200]   His name was Claudius and he instituted
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.200]   That men
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.200]   Or marriage is now outlawed
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.200]   Why would he do that? Because there was an
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   Exemption that if you were a man and you were married
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   You could be exempt from serving in the army
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   And he wanted to have an incredibly successful military
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   So he said marriage is outlawed
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   Sex, encouraged, orgies, encouraged
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   Prostitution, encouraged, sleep with whoever
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   You want, encouraged
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   But no marriage
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   Now this created a real problem for Christians
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   This growing group
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.200]   Who said we are called to honor God
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.200]   No matter what an emperor says, we're not called to sleep with
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.200]   And have sex with and do what we want
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   But to honor God
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   And a pastor named Valentine
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   Said I am going to
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.200]   Marry Christians
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   And get married
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.200]   And so he did for years
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.200]   And eventually he was caught, taken before Rome
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.200]   And executed
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.200]   Beheaded and to this day
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.200]   And that was on February 14th, 2069
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.200]   To this day we celebrate that
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   Now what does that have to do with you in this life?
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   In that same example
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.200]   This is a guy who is saying I want to see
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   Godly Christian couples come together
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.200]   And marry and there is an enemy
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   That is trying to stop and prevent that from happening
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   You came in tonight and there is an
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   Enemy that is trying to stop and prevent
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   Godly Christian couples from
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   Coming together and he is going to sell you lies
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   Like that guy doesn't know what he is talking about
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   And sure we can sleep together but we are married in God's eyes
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   And look it is not that big of a deal if no one
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.200]   Knows our relationship and no one supports it
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.200]   And all of that is a lie from an enemy
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   Who doesn't want godly couples to come together
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.200]   He doesn't want Christian marriages that flourish
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.200]   He doesn't want generations of babies raised to be
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   Discipled where men and women come together
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.200]   And they say I am going to live for Jesus
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   In my home with my marriage
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.200]   I am going to honor them and love them before myself
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   And I am going to pursue Christ
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.200]   With my spouse
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   He wants anything but that to happen
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   And you are going to leave here tonight and you are going to be bombarded
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   With all of the different ways that everything I said is so
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   Unpractical because there is an enemy
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   And Jesus like Valentine wants you to
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   Experience the incredible gift of marriage
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   And the covenant
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   Of you and that other person
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   Who loved Jesus coming together
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.200]   And being a picture to the world
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   Of what marriage is about
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   Which is god's
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   Unending love for his bride
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.200]   The church that he gave his life for
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.200]   On a cross
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   Let me pray
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   Father I pray
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   That you would protect
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   Men and women in here
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.200]   Who genuinely
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.200]   Want to honor you
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   With their dating
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   Their sexuality, their life
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   I pray that you would form marriages
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.200]   Among couples here
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.200]   I was listening in different locations
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.200]   Around the country
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   And godly spouses would come together
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.200]   And they wouldn't be perfect
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.200]   People but they would worship a perfect god
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.200]   And they would pursue
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.200]   You together
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   I pray that you would stop
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.200]   Relationships that are right now in the room that need to be stopped
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.200]   And need to be broken up
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   Not because you want any more pain in their life
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   But because you love them and want to prevent
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.200]   Pain
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.200]   I pray that you would heal
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   Some of the scars that we carry
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   From pain, sexual pain
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.200]   Sexual experience
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.200]   And you would take our lives
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   And use them
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   For your glory
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   And it wouldn't take getting to the end
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.200]   And all the pain that Samson went through
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.200]   But you would take us right now
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   And move our hearts towards yours
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   We would live lives
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.200]   Surrendered to you
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.200]   We worship you now in song
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.880]   Amen.
