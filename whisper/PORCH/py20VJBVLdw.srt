1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Good evening and welcome to the porch.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,800
 I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex world of

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,920
 relationships.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,560
 Can we cue some music please? From our friendships to our romantic endeavors

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,200
 we'll explore our family bonds, estranged relationships,

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,240
 work dynamics, and perhaps even the relationship with oneself.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,320
 So how do we relate? To answer this we'll look to scripture and find exactly what

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,600
 God has to say about our relationships.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,360
 This is, after all, the Relationship Series.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,680
 Porch, how we doing? We doing okay tonight? Great to see you.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,200
 Glad to have you here with us in Dallas, Texas, but also glad to have all of our

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,680
 Porch Live locations tuning in

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,880
 from around the nation. Special shout out to Porch Live Tulsa,

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,680
 Fresno, and for the very first time, Porch Live Springfield.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,320
 Let's go Porch Live! Love it! Anybody from the Midwest in the room?

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
 We love the Midwest. Hey, well there's one movie

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,320
 where the top A-list celebrities of the 1990s all assembled together

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,520
 to form what is arguably one of the greatest cast lists

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,320
 of all time. It included an acting

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,120
 ensemble with household names like Val Kilmer

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,760
 and Ralph Fiennes, who you know as Voldemort, or Sandra Bullock,

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,040
 Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, Martin Short, Sir Patrick Stewart,

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,120
 Michelle Pfeiffer. But not just that, it had an amazing

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,080
 acting ensemble, but it also had award-winning musical composition by the

25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,720
 one

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,280
 and only Hans Zimmer. But not just that,

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,040
 it also boasted a title track sung by

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,080
 not one, but two powerhouses,

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,960
 Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. You see, there was good reason why the world was

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,400
 eagerly waiting and watch, anticipating the day when this movie would launch,

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,040
 which it eventually did in 1998. What movie

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,440
 am I talking to you about? An animated

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,560
 Bible story known as The Prince of Egypt.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,440
 If you've never seen the movie, then take the reference from your peers. It's well

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,960
 worth

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,160
 the watch. You see, The Prince of Egypt is a retelling of one of the most iconic stories in all

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,640
 of human history. It's the story of a guy by the name of Moses

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,000
 who goes to Egypt to free God's people, the nation of Israel

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,120
 or the Hebrew people. And like any good

40
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,120
 Hollywood historical adaptation, there's a little creative license. But what you find

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,960
 as you watch the movie is they really do a good job honoring the

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,000
 essence of the entire story. And

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,760
 they depict some very specific scenes that are just

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,720
 amazing to watch, that bring the story to life in a way

45
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,280
 that has touched me for a very long time. It's my favorite animated movie.

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,800
 And so rather than tell you a little bit about it, I thought I would show you one of those

47
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,520
 scenes in specific. So take a watch as Moses engages the burning bush.

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,920
 Now there are a lot of Moses movies

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,560
 out there and plenty of burning bush scenes you could watch. But the reason we wanted to pick

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,360
 this one specifically for you is I think it

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,840
 shows Moses wrestling with his sense of self

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,840
 better than any other film. And the reason that's important for us

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,760
 is because that's exactly what we're talking about tonight. You see, all series long as we've

54
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,400
 been making our way through the relationship series, we've been talking about

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,960
 what is God's design for relating to others. But tonight,

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,240
 as we bring the relationship series to a close,

57
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,480
 we want to talk to you about what God's design is

58
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,040
 as you relate to yourself. And so for us to do it,

59
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,840
 we're gonna be in the book of Exodus, chapter 3.

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,320
 You can grab a Bible, you can turn there with me, and what you need to know is that

61
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,680
 we're gonna work through three different ways in which we relate to ourselves.

62
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,480
 We're gonna talk about

63
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,560
 insignificance, insecurity, and inadequacy.

64
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,880
 To catch you up on the story as we find ourselves

65
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,640
 in chapter 3 of Exodus, we see that the Hebrews are enslaved

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,040
 to Egypt. They're under Pharaoh, and Pharaoh has feared the expansive growth

67
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,440
 of this fledgling nation. He's

68
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,760
 grown so fearful that this nation is growing so quickly

69
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,360
 that he has enslaved the entire population. But not just that. In order to

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,720
 exercise even further population control,

71
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,760
 what he orders is the death of every firstborn

72
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,680
 son within a Hebrew family. He decrees genocide.

73
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,080
 And yet, as God would have it,

74
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,480
 we meet Moses,

75
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,720
 who is a firstborn Hebrew son

76
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,640
 that is actually adopted into Pharaoh's household,

77
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,640
 raised by Pharaoh's own daughter,

78
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,760
 all for the purpose of eventually overthrowing Pharaoh

79
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,960
 through the power of God himself.

80
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,760
 And so what we find as we come to verse 1 is God's call to Moses to step

81
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,480
 into this grand purpose. And yet before he begins to unpack the purposes he has

82
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,360
 for Moses, he needs to write

83
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,120
 Moses' perspective of self. And so this is what it says in verse 1.

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,800
 "Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro,

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,560
 the priest of Midian. And he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness, and he

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,480
 came to Horeb,

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,640
 the mountain of God. And the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of

88
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
 the midst of a bush.

89
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,800
 And he looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed. So

90
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
 as a reasonable man, Moses said, 'I will turn aside to see this great sight. Why

91
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,840
 the bush is not burned?'

92
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,960
 And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see,

93
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,080
 God called to him out of the bush. Moses

94
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,440
 Moses. And he said, 'Here I am.'"

95
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,520
 As we open the story, we see that God

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,200
 is moving towards Moses. And we see it in verse 1, that he moves towards Moses all the

97
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,760
 way

98
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,840
 in the land of Midian. Midian, just for your perspective,

99
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,120
 is 500 to 600 miles away from Egypt, meaning Moses has

100
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,640
 gone a long ways from where he grew up. He has journeyed out,

101
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,800
 he has journeyed into the land of Midian, and he's at the Mount of Horeb.

102
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,080
 Horeb, when you translate it directly from the Hebrew,

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,200
 means barren or desolate. That's where God finds him.

104
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,640
 And he's shepherding his father-in-law's flock, which means that Moses

105
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,920
 has no sheep to his own name. So to put this into perspective for you,

106
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,680
 Moses has left the halls of Highland Park, and he has traveled into the wild

107
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,520
 and waste

108
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,360
 of West Texas, where he lives nowhere of significance,

109
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,480
 with no one of significance, doing nothing of significance.

110
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,360
 And yet it's out in the mundanity of Midian

111
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,400
 that God meets with him. And some of you need to know that tonight.

112
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,480
 Like, some of you need to know, like, in the

113
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,080
 in the sea of sand you see within your circumstances, and

114
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,960
 as barrenness abounds within your own life, where you feel like, "Man, I'm

115
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,160
 only in an insignificant place. I'm stuck where I am. I can't get

116
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,520
 out of this spot." God will come to you there.

117
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,720
 You don't need to be within the halls of power

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,280
 or seated amongst the privilege for God to come to you,

119
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,080
 because God comes to Moses in an insignificant

120
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,040
 setting. And yet he doesn't just come to catch up with him.

121
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,200
 Like, if you keep reading, we'll jump down to verse 9, it says, "And now behold, the cry of

122
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,800
 the people of Israel has come to me,

123
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,080
 and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,720
 oppressed them. Come, I will send you to Pharaoh,

125
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,440
 that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

126
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,440
 But Moses said to God, 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh

127
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,840
 and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?'" You see, God moves towards Moses,

128
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,240
 yes, but he also has a mission for Moses.

129
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,400
 Namely, he wants to use Moses

130
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,680
 to liberate his people, to free his followers,

131
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,400
 to change the destinies of people for generations. He has a grand plan

132
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,600
 in store for the life of Moses. Like, this is a

133
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,520
 world-changing, life-altering invitation. How does Moses respond?

134
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,360
 "Yes! Finally! I've been waiting for this moment!"

135
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,880
 "No. I'm going to spring into action. I'm going to pack my bags, I'm going to load my camel, I'm going to start

136
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,680
 riding off

137
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,080
 to Egypt immediately. We're going to get there as soon as possible, God." "No.

138
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,840
 Finally. It's about time you figured out that I was the guy."

139
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,160
 "No, that's not God. That's not Moses' response. What is Moses'

140
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,760
 response?" He gets nervous. Like, he starts pitting.

141
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,520
 He starts sweating. He starts second-guessing

142
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,280
 that God's got the right guy. Like, he looks like that NFL draft that you don't

143
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,040
 want to pick.

144
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,640
 He's the guy that's walking across stage, and you're like, "No, don't do it! Don't pick that guy!"

145
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,320
 Because he's the one that's walking up to the commissioner and shaking his hand and saying,

146
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,720
 "Hey, are you sure about this thing? Like, did they actually pick me?

147
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,480
 You could have gone with someone better." What would that guy inspire

148
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,840
 in the mind's eyes of his fans? No confidence.

149
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,400
 Like, the fans don't want to cheer his name. The fans don't want that guy at all.

150
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,200
 And yet, porch. That guy

151
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,920
 is exactly who God wants. That's exactly

152
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,520
 who God wants. Like, just look at the way that God responds to him.

153
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,200
 Verse 12, "And God said,

154
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,880
 'But I'll be with you, and this shall be the sign for you

155
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,760
 that I've sent you. When you have brought the people of Egypt, or when you've brought the people

156
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,040
 out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.'

157
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,840
 Then Moses said to God, 'If I come to the people of Israel, and I say to them,

158
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,120
 "The God of your fathers has sent me to you," and they ask, "Well, what's his name?

159
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,760
 What should I say to them?" And God said to Moses, "I am

160
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,880
 who I am." And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel.

161
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,600
 I am has sent me to you." God also said to Moses,

162
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,280
 "And say this to the people of Israel. The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of

163
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,760
 Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, he has sent me to you. This is my name

164
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,760
 forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations."

165
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,760
 Like, God doesn't respond to Moses by boosting his confidence,

166
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,480
 by stroking his ego, by hyping him up. He doesn't even agree with the guy. Like, he

167
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,680
 doesn't come to Moses and go, "Yeah, man. You're definitely a work in progress. Let's get a

168
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,400
 personal improvement plan together and get you in a tip-top shape, because this

169
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,880
 is going to be a big job, and I don't know that you're ready for it." That's not God's

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,760
 approach to Moses whatsoever. What is God's approach to Moses? As Moses

171
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,120
 looks at him, he's like, "You got the wrong guy. Like, who am I?"

172
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,560
 God looks at him and says, "Who are you? Who am I? I am that I am."

173
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,600
 Like, you're asking the wrong question. Like,

174
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,760
 I am the one that is going to be with you. Don't worry about yourself.

175
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,840
 Worry about me. I'm the one that's coming with you on this grand journey,

176
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,240
 because you see true significance. It's not found in who you are. It's found in

177
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,560
 who God is. True significance isn't found in who you

178
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,200
 are. It is found in who God is. Meaning, if you want a right view of

179
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,720
 yourself, then you need to get a right view of him.

180
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,920
 That's how you get a good view of yourself. You get a good,

181
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,360
 long view of him. You need to know him as he is.

182
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,040
 And the good news is, he gives us three descriptors for himself. He tells us

183
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,280
 exactly who he is. He gives us three things. What's he say?

184
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:23,080
 He says, "I will be with you." Like, what's that mean? Like, no matter

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,200
 what in your life leaves you feeling insignificant, where you come from, the

186
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,000
 job you have, the past you carry, the shame you feel,

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,680
 the sort of people you surround yourself with, the

188
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,000
 struggles that you endure, no matter what leaves you feeling insignificant, if God

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,640
 is with you, he is present in your life, then insignificance is not your story.

190
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:51,480
 Isaiah 41 10 tells us, "Fear not, for I'm with you. Be not dismayed. I am your God.

191
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,920
 I will strengthen you. I will help you. I'll uphold you with my righteous right

192
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,360
 hand." Psalm 23, a famous psalm in verse 4 says,

193
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,240
 "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

194
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,800
 I will fear no evil." Why? "For you are with me.

195
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,400
 Your rod, your staff, they comfort me." Zephaniah 3 17

196
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:20,200
 it says, "The Lord your God is with you. The mighty warrior who saves," and look at

197
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,560
 what he does, "he will take great delight in you.

198
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,640
 In his love, he will no longer rebuke you,

199
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,360
 but he'll rejoice over you with singing." You see, the presence of

200
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,320
 one who is significant dignifies that which is insignificant.

201
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,760
 I remember in 2015 reading an article about someone that made $60,000

202
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,640
 because they sold a bag of air on eBay from a Kanye West

203
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,120
 concert. $60,000 for a bag of air!

204
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,040
 Listen to me, porch. If the presence of Kanye West

205
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,960
 can take something as insignificant as a Ziploc baggie of air

206
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,360
 and auction it for 60k, how much more valuable do you think the

207
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,960
 presence of God in your life will make you

208
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,160
 infinitely, infinitely, infinitely more valuable?

209
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,360
 Because he's with you. The second thing he tells us is he tells us his name.

210
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,360
 He says, "I am who I am." Now listen, there's an entire sermon locked up in that

211
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,320
 statement. That's something for another time,

212
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,560
 but just to give it to you very simply, what God is saying is God

213
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:40,760
 is saying, "I am." He is. He is not the God of just one thing.

214
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,200
 God of water, God of rivers, God of war, God of love, God of harvest. He is not the

215
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,560
 God of one thing. He is the God of everything.

216
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,880
 Like, he is self-existent.

217
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:03,480
 Like, before anything was, he is. He has always been. He will always be.

218
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,240
 And he is self-sufficient. He needs no one

219
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,640
 or no thing. Like, hello, the bush was on fire yet not consumed.

220
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,560
 He defies natural order because he is self-sufficient. He is self-sustaining,

221
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,920
 and he is self-directed. I mean, he didn't take orders from anybody.

222
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,520
 He's the one in charge. He's the one who makes the calls. He's the one that

223
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,440
 determines where and when and what he does.

224
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,280
 And yet, here's the thing. If God is eternally constant, totally

225
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,400
 independent, and supremely dominant, so transcendent

226
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,240
 above all other beings, yet he is with you,

227
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,880
 then just think about it. Though God has always been,

228
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,320
 he wants to be with you.

229
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:58,360
 Though God needs no one or no thing, he wants to be with you. Though God

230
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,440
 does not take orders from anyone, he wants to be with you

231
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,200
 because that's who he is. He is God powerful, yet God present.

232
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,400
 And thirdly, he's a God of promise because that's what he tells us. He gives

233
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,160
 us a promise. He says, "I'm the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac,

234
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,160
 and Jacob." Why is he rolling that line out? Because he wants them to know, "Hey,

235
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,640
 the word that I gave to your family in times past,

236
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,800
 I will keep in times to come. I am the same God back then

237
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,160
 as I will be today, as I will be in the future. I'm not just a God that

238
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,360
 reigns over everything. I'm a God that relates to a specific people,

239
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,800
 to my people, to those that call on my name and believe

240
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,200
 in my son." Why does any of this matter? Because when you combine a God that's

241
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,680
 present with a God that's powerful, with a God of promise, what you get is a

242
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,960
 God so significant where everything he says

243
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,160
 about himself changes everything you see about yourself.

244
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,560
 And friends, I don't know if you don't like what you see in the mirror,

245
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,880
 but if you don't, if you wake up and you take a hard look at yourself and you

246
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,520
 don't like what's staring back at you, then listen to

247
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,280
 me. It's time for you to stop telling yourself,

248
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,960
 telling God about yourself, and time to start telling yourself about God.

249
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,720
 That's the right step for you, and that step can begin tonight.

250
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,200
 Now some of you, you're here and you're like, "Listen, I get that.

251
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,640
 Insignificance is part of my story. Where I come from, I'm ashamed of it. The things

252
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,200
 that I've done, yeah, I wish I could take those

253
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,880
 back. My family, they're not the greatest of people, but it's not just

254
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,520
 insignificance that gets in the way, Kylin. I also, I've got some insecurities.

255
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,640
 I've done some things. I've been some places. What do you have to say about

256
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,920
 that?" Well, thankfully, Moses can relate to you pretty

257
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,040
 well, and so we'll keep reading. We're actually going to jump down to chapter

258
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,000
 four, and we're going to read this in verse one.

259
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,560
 "Then Moses answered God, 'But behold, they will not believe me or

260
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,200
 listen to my voice, for they will say, 'The Lord

261
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,640
 did not appear to you.'" Why is Moses so insecure as to think that

262
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,080
 the people of Israel won't listen to him, won't believe him

263
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,040
 when he shows up? I mean, God literally just said, "Hey, go

264
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,880
 and declare my name to them." When they ask, "This is who I am. I am

265
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,280
 that I am. Go and tell them that this is my name."

266
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,120
 And yet Moses, he has a rebuttal. "But God, what if they don't believe me?" Why is he

267
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,080
 so insecure to think that these people won't believe him?

268
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,560
 Because he knows, and they know, what he did in the past.

269
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,800
 He knows, and they know, that he already ruined his reputation,

270
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,360
 and he fears there's no coming back from it. So what did he do?

271
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,000
 Well, we don't have time to read it, but if you go and you look at Exodus 2, you

272
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,480
 get a story about Moses in his younger years.

273
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,040
 And what you see is a young man that has all this unbridled passion for the very

274
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,000
 thing that God's calling him to do. He wants to deliver

275
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,080
 his people, the Hebrew people, God's people, out of slavery. That's what he's

276
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,760
 burdened for. That's what he wants to do. And yet he tries to do it on his own

277
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,640
 strength. He tries to do it by his own power.

278
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,840
 And so what he does is he springs into action. He sees an Egyptian

279
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,880
 who's attacking a Hebrew. He says, "That's not cool."

280
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,720
 Jumps in. He kills the Egyptian, which is probably taking it a little bit too far.

281
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,240
 And then he buries the body in the sand, tries to hide the evidence.

282
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,920
 And yet he does such a bad job at hiding the evidence that he actually gets

283
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,400
 exposed in front of everybody. Like everyone knows what what Moses did.

284
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,160
 Everybody knows he's at the top of Egypt's most wanted list.

285
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,240
 And not only that, rather than becoming the deliverer that his people desired,

286
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,000
 he becomes a murderer that all of them despised.

287
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,080
 He's ousted. He's rejected. No one wants anything to do with him. He is

288
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,280
 ostracized into the wilderness, into the land of Midian.

289
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,520
 That's why this whole proposal from God feels so hard to stomach.

290
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,240
 Doesn't make any sense. God, you can't send me back there.

291
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,920
 They know what I did. Like I'm not just a nobody from nowhere. I

292
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,640
 actually used to be a somebody that blew it in front of everybody.

293
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,360
 And so I can't go back. You've got the wrong guy.

294
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,320
 It reminds me of a time in my life when I made the switch from corporate into

295
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,920
 ministry. Like I left the safety of the

296
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,120
 corporate work environment and I made my way into the instability

297
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,080
 of the ministry world. And yet I did so knowing, like man, I think that this thing

298
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,880
 could work. Like I believe, and I have some friends around

299
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,960
 me, community that have edified the fact that yeah, like you love the Bible and

300
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,080
 you've got some communication gifts. Yeah, they need to be worked out, but

301
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,360
 man, you've got some raw potential. Like get out there and go for it. And so

302
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,040
 I stepped into ministry and yet the thing that you need to know about teaching

303
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:56,440
 is the only way to assess fully how good you are at it is the hard launch.

304
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,440
 Like you just got to go for it. Okay, and so I finally got the chance to do that.

305
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,120
 In 2017, I stood on stage with a speaking

306
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,440
 opportunity for the very first time in my life.

307
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,560
 It was a crowd of several thousand people. It was awesome.

308
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,680
 Meaningful moment for me. And I remember it like it was yesterday. Like the

309
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,200
 evening came, the worship started, the people stood, the

310
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,040
 hands were raised, and worship came to a close, and the people

311
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,120
 applauded, and the drums washed out, and I felt my moment

312
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,240
 is here. At long last, this is it. This is my

313
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,840
 chance. This is what I've been preparing for.

314
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,240
 Tonight marks the journey as I move my way into being a preacher of God's word.

315
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,720
 And not just a preacher, but a powerful preacher

316
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,840
 of God's word. I'm gonna do this thing. Tonight is the night.

317
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:45,480
 And so as the drums washed, I in slow motion rose from my seat

318
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,800
 and began to make my way to the stage. And as I ascended the steps, and I walked

319
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,840
 to the center, rather than share a few announcements and

320
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,640
 then transition this really smoothly back into worship, I, like a deer in

321
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,480
 headlights, froze.

322
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:19,400
 What's my line? What am I supposed to say?

323
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,960
 You see, my moment had arrived, but I had not.

324
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,720
 And rather than proving myself to be a speaker, the likes of which all people

325
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,560
 would want to listen to, all I'd proven is I didn't know how to speak at all.

326
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,000
 Moses is in a really similar spot. He wanted to be a deliverer, but when the

327
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,840
 moment came, he blew his chance. He failed. He knows it. Everyone knows it.

328
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,280
 And he just thinks that there's no coming back from it. That's why he's

329
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,160
 insecure. Like he didn't just make some

330
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,960
 questionable decisions that led to a bad reputation.

331
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,400
 No, he made an irreversible decision that ruined his reputation.

332
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,760
 Like he doesn't think that these people will believe God sent him because he

333
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,760
 doesn't believe that he deserves to be sent.

334
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,320
 And the reason for it is because he's so preoccupied with his past.

335
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,080
 He's so stuck in the rear view that he can't move

336
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,680
 on. And the truth of the matter is, Porch, if we can be really honest with

337
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,840
 ourselves tonight, some of us are in that exact same place.

338
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,000
 Some of you look back and you know the things you did. You know the

339
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,800
 choices you made. You know the people that you hurt. You know the secrets that

340
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,960
 you hid. You know the places that you went and the

341
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,920
 words that you spoke. You know all of it. And as you look back, you can't even

342
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,920
 contemplate moving forward because of everything you've done.

343
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,680
 All the history behind you merely haunts you.

344
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,360
 And so rather than open yourselves to the opportunity that God may want to do

345
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,800
 something in you, what you do is you close yourself off from the possibility

346
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,920
 that God wants anything to do with you. You feel like Moses. You feel like a

347
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,960
 failure. You ruined your reputation. You wrecked

348
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,240
 your witness. You did that thing which cannot be undone.

349
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,560
 And now no one will ever believe that God actually wants to use you.

350
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:19,880
 If that's you, then listen. You won't feel worthy until God enters your story.

351
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:28,120
 You want to feel worthy? If you're here and you don't know Jesus,

352
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,840
 then you will find worth nowhere else.

353
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,440
 You won't feel worthy until God enters your story.

354
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,800
 That's why God gives Moses three different signs in verses 2

355
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,800
 through 9 of chapter 4. He does it to boost his believability.

356
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,080
 Not just so people believe, "Man, Moses really changed." But so people

357
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,000
 believe Moses was really changed by God. Like that's what God cares about. Like he

358
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,960
 isn't like the world that just wants to

359
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,480
 medicate us with self-help strategies, positive self-talk,

360
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,840
 improve your self-image. He's not like that.

361
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,240
 God doesn't just want you to become different. God wants to be the reason you

362
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,320
 become different because the difference he's going to make

363
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,520
 is a difference that no one else can make. And it'll be a difference the likes

364
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,280
 of which the world will look at and be like,

365
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,960
 "That is crazy. Did you know that guy? Did you know that girl? Like I knew them

366
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,400
 back in the day. They were heinous. They were wild. They

367
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,920
 were crazy. And yet look at them now. Like they're

368
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,600
 not heathen, they're holy. Like something's changed. They have a

369
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,680
 different pep in their step. Like they're

370
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:39,640
 walking with a new kind of confidence." Because that sort of difference,

371
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,920
 it won't come by way of anything in this world. It will come

372
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,000
 by way of only Christ.

373
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,480
 That's what God cares about. That's why he turns Moses' staff

374
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,440
 into a snake. Like think about it. The pharaohs with their headdresses look

375
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:02,440
 like what? Cobras. God is saying, "Hey, I have power

376
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,920
 over the powers in your story." Why does he do the whole bit with

377
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,200
 leprosy? Because God's saying, "Hey, I have power over life and death

378
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,480
 itself." The last sign he gives them is he turns

379
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,320
 water into blood. Like, "Hey, why does he do that? Why does he affect

380
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,280
 the Nile?" Because the Nile was seen as the sole source of provision

381
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,800
 to the fertile crescent, to the nation of Egypt. And yet God's saying, "No, no, no.

382
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,400
 The Nile doesn't have the power to give and take away. I have the power to give

383
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,960
 and take away. I am the power to provide. Do you have the power to make a mess of

384
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,600
 your past? Yes, but God has the power

385
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,680
 to make something meaningful of your future.

386
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,360
 He has the power to do that. A power the likes of which you will find nowhere

387
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,000
 else. Paul says it like this in 1 Corinthians 1,

388
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,320
 28 and 29. He says, "God has chosen what is insignificant and despised in

389
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,360
 the world, what is viewed as nothing, to bring to

390
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,800
 nothing what is viewed as something, so that no one may boast, only God, no

391
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,960
 one may boast in his presence." You see, God is the difference maker.

392
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,480
 He's the sea splitter. He's the miracle worker. He's the storm calmer. He is the

393
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,920
 grace giver. Like, God's the one that can take

394
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,080
 back what you feel can never be taken back. He's the one that can heal what you

395
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,960
 feel can never be healed. He's the one that can clean what you feel

396
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,400
 is too deep a stain, the likes of which no one can ever actually make it well.

397
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,320
 Because he gives grace like you wouldn't believe. And the reason we know it,

398
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,680
 this porch, the reason we know it is because we don't need to look at three

399
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,560
 different signs. We need only look at one singular son,

400
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,320
 the son of God, who stepped down into our story

401
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,680
 and was not merely preoccupied with our past. I've got to fix him.

402
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,800
 He was crucified by your past. And yet when he rose forth from the grave,

403
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,560
 he left all of your insecurity in the grave with him. He rose forth

404
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,760
 into new life. And if you place your faith in him,

405
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,280
 you can rise forth and have the same.

406
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,680
 But Kyla and I, I know I'm forgiven. I know that.

407
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,360
 Like, I'm not worried about my past. I've placed my faith in Jesus. It's not the

408
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,520
 past that I'm worried about. It's the future.

409
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,240
 Like, yeah, I think God wants to do something, but man, I don't have, I don't

410
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,520
 have the raw materials to do it. Like, I see some of the places that he

411
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,320
 wants to lead me. I feel some of the dreams that I want to chase.

412
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,040
 And I don't think that I have the ability. You see, your problem isn't

413
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,200
 insignificance. It's not insecurity. It's inadequacy.

414
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,000
 So what do we do with that? Well, Moses deals with inadequacy too,

415
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,600
 because we read this in verses 10 through 12.

416
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:47,880
 "But Moses said to the Lord, 'Oh my Lord, I'm not eloquent, either in the past

417
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,320
 or since you've spoken to your servant, but I'm slow

418
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,320
 of speech and of tongue.' And then the Lord said to him, 'Who has

419
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,120
 made man's mouth? Who makes him mute or deaf or seeing

420
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,840
 or blind? Is it not I, the Lord? Now therefore go, and I'll be with your

421
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,840
 mouth, and I'll teach you what you shall speak.'"

422
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,600
 You see, Moses sees all that God wants to do in his life,

423
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,280
 and yet he resists the call of God, not once, not twice,

424
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,280
 not thrice, but five times, which just feels

425
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,320
 laughable when you read it all the way through. Not just because he's that

426
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
 friend that keeps coming up with excuses and never is willing to commit to

427
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,040
 Friday night plans. No, it feels laughable because he has

428
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,520
 somehow forgotten the fact that he's talking to God.

429
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:45,400
 And so he starts by telling God, "But Lord, I'm insignificant, like

430
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,840
 I'm a nobody from nowhere." And yet God's like, "No man, like I'm the one that's

431
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,800
 going to make you significant, but God, I've got insecurities. Like look at the

432
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,960
 things that I did in my past. Like I don't know,

433
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,440
 everybody knows, and there's no coming back from that. Don't worry about those

434
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,640
 things. I can provide all the believability you

435
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,520
 need, the credibility gap you feel. I can fill it actually, but God, I'm not

436
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,720
 a, I'm inadequate. Like I don't have the the tools or the

437
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,520
 training to do that what you're calling me to do. There's got to be someone else.

438
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,880
 You've got the wrong guy." And yet here's the crazy thing.

439
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:21,400
 He's saying all of it to a burning bush, like this supernatural spectacle,

440
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,760
 this unfathomable phenomenon. He is staring at a manifestation of the

441
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,400
 presence of God, and yet he is so engulfed by his

442
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,880
 inadequacies that he misses God standing right in

443
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,360
 front of him.

444
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:46,440
 That's what happens when we can, when we become consumed by our constraints,

445
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,320
 when we're engulfed by our inadequacies. Like contrary to the way a lot of people

446
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,880
 preach this passage, Moses isn't in the middle of an identity

447
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,600
 crisis. He knows exactly who he is. He is well

448
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,880
 acquainted with all of his weakness. He is telling

449
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,800
 God every one of his flaws. This story is not

450
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,280
 about a man that is delusional about all of, about who he is. This is a

451
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,240
 story about a man who is disappointed by who he is.

452
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,920
 He knows he has problems, so much so that he can't even see past them

453
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,080
 to the plans that God has for his life.

454
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,320
 Is that happening to you?

455
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:40,840
 Like, are you thinking too much of your problems that you're willing to punt

456
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,920
 on the plans God has for your life while you settle into sheep herding on

457
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,040
 the backside of nowhere?

458
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,840
 Is that you?

459
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,040
 Like, too often we look at ourselves and all we see is like, "I'm not smart enough

460
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,240
 to start that non-profit, God. Like, I know there's a great need and I want

461
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,520
 to fill it, but I'm not smart enough to do that." Or, "God, I know my family's got

462
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,920
 some problems. Many of them don't even believe in you, and yet, God,

463
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,520
 I'm not bold enough to actually transcend being the kid young brother or

464
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,680
 the kid young sister. I actually am not enough to do that, Lord." Or, "God, I

465
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,040
 know I've got some problems and some pain that I really need to work through

466
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,400
 and some forgiveness I need to send, but God, I'm actually not strong enough

467
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,240
 to do those things." Or, "God, I'm not eloquent enough to preach

468
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,960
 your gospel to share Jesus Christ with my entire department, Lord.

469
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,240
 Lord, I'm not faithful enough to believe that you can save

470
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,880
 my entire department, God. I don't think I'm enough, God. I'm not

471
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,960
 smart enough. I'm not witty enough. I'm not pretty enough.

472
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,600
 I'm not funny enough, God. I'm not good enough. I'm just not enough."

473
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:51,400
 And yet, God answers Moses in the same way he answers you tonight,

474
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:57,000
 and in a way the likes of which I wouldn't have guessed.

475
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,680
 He says, "Don't you think I know that?

476
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:10,840
 Do you think your weaknesses or your inadequacies, all the constraints and

477
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,320
 limitations you feel, you think that stuff catches me off guard?

478
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:22,200
 No, I made you that way. You're exactly as I want you to be. You are

479
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,400
 who I want you to be. If I wanted you to be someone else,

480
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,080
 I would have made you into someone else. But no, you're exactly

481
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,080
 as I want you to be."

482
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,640
 You see, Porch,

483
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,640
 if you're good enough for God, then you're enough as is.

484
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,680
 If you are enough for God, then you are enough as is.

485
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:56,120
 Now, am I saying that in this point to give you license to

486
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,560
 seek after your sin and indulge all your desires?

487
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,360
 No, that's not why we're talking about this. I'm saying this because so many of

488
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,600
 us, we look at ourselves

489
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,280
 and we know what God says about us, that he says I'm enough.

490
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:20,200
 And yet that's just not enough for us. We know what God says, but we don't care

491
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,920
 what God says about us. We care what we say about ourselves.

492
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,520
 You see, too often we want to be like the dudes at the gym.

493
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,920
 We want to fudge our numbers and we want to make ourselves look way

494
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,040
 bigger than we actually are. And in the process of doing that,

495
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:49,000
 we expose ourselves for being far smaller than we actually want to be seen.

496
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,680
 We don't feel like we're enough. And so we feel like we need to

497
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,360
 get better. We need to grow up. We need to move on. We need to mature more

498
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,680
 quickly. We want to be smarter. We want to be stronger. We want to be

499
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,840
 braver. We want to be bolder. We want to be whatever it is for you.

500
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,720
 Whatever it is you feel is insufficient in your life,

501
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,120
 you want for because you believe you're not enough for yourself. And because

502
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,720
 you're not enough for yourself, you'll never be enough for anybody else.

503
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:23,800
 That's my story at least. Like as far back as I can remember

504
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,920
 and more frequently than I'd like to count,

505
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,200
 I have fallen just shy of sufficient for the things that I've wanted in life.

506
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,280
 Like whether it wasn't being popular enough in grade school or athletic

507
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,200
 enough in high school or impressive enough in college or smooth

508
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,920
 enough with the opposite sex or smart enough in the corporate world

509
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,880
 or even talented enough in ministry.

510
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,480
 I have been repeatedly confronted by the fact

511
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,960
 that I don't care so much what other people have to say about me.

512
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,000
 I care far more what I have to say about myself

513
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,560
 and what I have to say about myself in times past as I look in the rear view

514
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,920
 and I consider my story,

515
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:15,320
 is I see a life littered with limitations all pronouncing the same

516
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,880
 judgment

517
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,640
 that I'm not enough.

518
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:30,440
 I felt for so long like I was in a perpetual state of second place

519
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,440
 that I was nobody's first choice and as I grew older and I

520
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,840
 processed my past what I eventually learned is

521
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,280
 is because I was so dissatisfied with myself that dissatisfaction didn't just

522
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,920
 turn into into uh into a fear of of of

523
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,080
 falling short and failing along the way. No what it turned into was

524
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,320
 a deep-seated self-hate.

525
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,280
 I hated my hardwiring, hated my personality,

526
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,600
 I hated the way that God made me to be because I had dreamed dreams

527
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,920
 so great and yet I was so small and insignificant,

528
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:18,120
 too small and insecure, too small and inadequate to reach them.

529
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,200
 I found myself where Moses finds himself at the very end of this story like after

530
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,480
 he rolls out all of the excuses that he can give

531
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,840
 God he has nothing left to hide behind and so he just looks at the Lord and

532
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,520
 says God I don't even like who I am. Like God I'm not enough so God please

533
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,160
 just pick somebody else. Like God I've given up on myself. I don't

534
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,160
 want to move forward. I don't want to lean into the life you'd

535
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,840
 have for me God. The purposes you have they're far too big

536
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,440
 because my perspective of self is far too small. God please

537
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,200
 choose someone else and I love the way the story ends

538
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,160
 because it says that God is angered which feels like such a weird swerve.

539
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,080
 Like God why would you be angry in this moment and yet God is

540
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,840
 never once angered over the course of this passage. Like as Moses

541
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,920
 rolls out all of his resistance and he puts forward all of his pushback

542
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,760
 God works through every single excuse and yet the moment when Moses

543
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,120
 is finally willing to just give up on himself

544
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:26,680
 God's angered. No Moses don't do it. I've not given up on you. I've got

545
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,680
 plans for your life. I've got something I want to do.

546
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:37,000
 You may feel too small but I am too big. I can make up for whatever weakness you

547
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,120
 feel. I am strong enough to bridge the

548
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,440
 bridge the divide to fill the gap to lead you where we're gonna go.

549
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,520
 But don't give up. Don't say you want someone else

550
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,160
 because I don't want anyone else. I want you.

551
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,240
 And as I experienced the truth of that message in my life it changed

552
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:05,800
 everything. It unlocked me from all of these these self-deprecating

553
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,600
 self-shaming self-hating thoughts.

554
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,520
 It allowed me to walk with God

555
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,760
 and in a way that I wouldn't have dared dream be possible.

556
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,400
 I would never have thought I'd do the things I've done.

557
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,720
 I'd be the places I am. I'd know him like I do.

558
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:38,520
 Friends if you're here and you want to move from feeling so

559
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:46,360
 despicable to feeling so desirable desired by God in heaven

560
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,320
 then take it from someone who knows. You don't need to keep looking at

561
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,880
 yourself. You need to start looking to him. You need

562
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,400
 to see that Jesus Christ he came into your

563
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,960
 insignificance. He was seeking you in life when you were

564
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,200
 you were too unimportant to seek. You need to look to Jesus Christ who came

565
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,560
 into your insecurities who served you in a death when you were

566
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,760
 too unworthy to love. And you need to look to Jesus Christ who

567
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,640
 came into your insecurities saving you with a resurrection that has

568
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,120
 that has qualified you for everlasting life.

569
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,080
 If you're here and you want a new perspective on yourself

570
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,680
 then don't look inward before you look upward.

571
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,000
 You look to him and in seeing him rightly

572
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 I promise you'll see yourself rightly as a result.

573
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:49,720
 And let me pray for us. God we love you. God I want this this truth so badly for

574
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,720
 these people because God this story feels like my

575
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,360
 story. My life wracked and riddled by so much self-hate.

576
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,400
 And I know God there are some in this room that feel the same way that look at

577
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,760
 themselves and and they're just disgusted. They're just

578
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,280
 disappointed. They just want for more. They've got a

579
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,520
 dream, a desire, a goal, an ambition they want to reach God. And

580
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,400
 it's not even self-seeking God. It's to make a difference in the world. And yet

581
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,200
 God they look at themselves and say I don't have the raw materials. I don't

582
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,200
 have the right resources. I don't have the sort of faculties required to get me

583
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,600
 to that place. And yet God you look at them and you say

584
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,720
 no I want you as you are because I'm going to use you as you are.

585
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,080
 The worse the odds the greater the glory for me.

586
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,560
 You may feel weak but into your weakness I will make myself strong. And the reason

587
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,800
 we know is because God into the weakness of our sin

588
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,760
 you made yourself most strong because you sent Jesus to save us

589
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,040
 forever. If you don't know Jesus Christ then you can be saved tonight.

590
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,440
 And you can find all of the significance and all the security

591
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,520
 and all the adequacy that he offers by simply receiving

592
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,520
 the gift of salvation by placing your faith in him.

593
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,560
 Others of you you're going to need to process with someone. That's what we're

594
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,800
 here for. That's what tonight's about and we're

595
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,160
 going to do it as long as it's required. But God we love you

596
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,120
 and we sing to you now it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
