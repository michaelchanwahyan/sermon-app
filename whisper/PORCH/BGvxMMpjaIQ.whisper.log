[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.680]   - All right.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.400]   Well, welcome friends in the room in El Paso, Phoenix,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.840]   Tulsa, Austin, Houston, Fayetteville,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720]   Philly, wherever you are joining,
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.080]   and especially friends here,
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540]   we are kicking off a brand new series tonight
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.600]   on the Book of Esther.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.440]   One of the most unique books in all of the Bible.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.520]   So if this is your first night,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.720]   you chose a great night to come,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.520]   'cause we're about to open up this book
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.960]   that is like a, if Game of Thrones,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.760]   The Bachelor and Princess Diaries had a baby,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.160]   that would be the Book of Esther.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.440]   So it is about to go down in here.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.960]   Hey, let me start by sharing a little bit about me
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.900]   and it'll give us some tracks of where we're going.
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.260]   My team would say that I am a little bit of a germaphobe.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.260]   Like I like to keep Purell around me all the time.
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.420]   If you are sick, I don't want you to come into work.
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.640]   Don't be a hero.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.480]   I'm not impressed by how tough you are.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.680]   You're just being selfish
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.680]   and you're getting all the rest of us sick.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.480]   Yesterday I was writing this message
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.560]   and I feel like all the coronavirus
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.860]   has only made everybody a little bit more like,
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.240]   (coughs)
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.080]   excuse me.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.480]   (audience laughs)
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.880]   I was at Starbucks
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.540]   and it was like everywhere that I went in this Starbucks,
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.340]   I switched seats three different times
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.280]   'cause I kept sitting next to people who were like,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.780]   (coughs)
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.860]   and you're like, dude, what are you doing here right now?
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.300]   You should be home.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.900]   And now all of us are gonna be sick because of you.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.540]   And then I switched seats and I sat right next to a guy
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.920]   and people just like don't know how to cough appropriately,
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.900]   like cough into your arm or into your hand
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.740]   or into your shirt.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.860]   Don't just let it out there, people.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.260]   And then I went to the restroom
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.000]   and somebody told me this recently
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.420]   and I went to go like wash my hands
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.020]   in the midst of working on this message
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.140]   and they didn't have paper towels,
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.260]   they only had the air vents.
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.860]   And somebody this past week told me
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.380]   that if you wash your hands and you blow dry your hands,
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.140]   you might as well not even wash your hands
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.000]   'cause it just circulates all that air
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.500]   and blows all the different things,
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.800]   bacteria and germs that are in the air on there.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.540]   So I'm like, dude, I'm toast now
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.420]   and just thinking I'm for sure, you know,
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.060]   gonna get out of here and get sick.
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.220]   And I found myself in those moments going like,
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.580]   man, I just wish I could see the germ presence here.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.380]   Like I wish I had, you know, microscopic eyes
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.460]   that would allow me to know like,
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.380]   oh man, I can see those things flying
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.260]   through the air right now.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.380]   Or someone who sat in this chair before me,
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.120]   don't sit in that chair 'cause that is the flu chair
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.660]   if you could go over here and just an ability
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.340]   to kind of see 'cause you know it's there,
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.280]   you know that they're all around you
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.220]   but you can't really see where all these different germs are.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.220]   This is going somewhere, by the way,
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.900]   I'm not just getting this off my chest.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.020]   And I wish I had, you know, the ability
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.060]   to almost see that microscopically,
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.660]   the presence of something I know is there
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.220]   but I can't really see it in the moment.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.220]   And the reason I start there is 'cause I think
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.540]   that for me, a lot of times I feel that way about God.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.880]   And here's what I mean.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.340]   Like I know that he's present and I know that he's at work
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.140]   but I just can't always see exactly how he's at work
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.400]   and what he's doing behind the scenes, if you will.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.300]   I can't always see like, maybe for you,
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.420]   it's in a dating relationship and you're wondering like,
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.540]   man, is this person the person that God would have me
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.740]   move forward with?
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.600]   Or maybe for you, it's a career or job wondering like,
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.100]   God, did you just open up a door
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.820]   and you want me to walk through that door?
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.420]   And is this you working here?
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.020]   Sometimes when we look back in life,
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.120]   we're able to see like, man,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.420]   I just think that was a God thing.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.660]   I think he was in all that and I'm sure he had me live
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.940]   in that dorm room, you know, back then next to that person
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.620]   because this was gonna happen.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.040]   But in the moment, it's really hard to see
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.300]   and I can find myself wishing like,
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.380]   I just knew or I just wish I knew what God was up to.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.220]   I know he's there, I know he's at work,
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.320]   but I just wish I could see what I can't see.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.300]   And the book of Esther was a message to the people of Israel
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.660]   that even when it looks like God is hidden,
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.500]   you can rest assured he's working.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.060]   It's a book that really, the reason I say that
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.140]   is throughout the entire book,
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.980]   there's something really interesting.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.600]   It's one of two books in the Bible
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.220]   that never mentions the name God
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.180]   and never talks about prayer and never talks about God
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.820]   and never foreshadows even extra spiritual things
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.480]   or supernatural, if you will, things
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.180]   in terms of how we often think of miraculous things,
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.460]   but it clearly showcases the providence
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.900]   or the hand of God moving the pieces around
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.180]   and God working and moving the hearts of people,
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.980]   the locations of people and directing the lives of people.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.220]   The name Esther even means hidden.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.380]   It was a message that was given to the people of Israel
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.260]   to know confidently, even when you can't see God
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.960]   in the forefront of him at work,
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.600]   you can know he is at work and is working things
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.200]   for his purposes all around you.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.160]   And so tonight we're gonna start
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.620]   and look at the first couple chapters in this book,
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.900]   chapters one and chapter two,
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.340]   where we can begin to trace some of the ways
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.700]   that you and I can know, hey, this is where God is at work.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.160]   So now we're gonna talk about some of the areas
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.620]   that you can know here is some of the ways
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.940]   that God is at work.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.580]   And for us to dive in, I gotta do a little bit of like,
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.860]   here's some historical lessons.
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.180]   So everybody put their thinking cap on
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.480]   to get a little refresher on what exactly is going on.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.060]   So Esther, Esther is the main character in the book.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.260]   The entire thing takes place in the Persian empire,
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.220]   like 500 years before Jesus was around.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.800]   So here's like what the Old Testament is about.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.380]   If you don't know anything about, you know,
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.700]   faith, religion, Christianity, here's what the Bible,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.020]   Bible, two parts, first part, Old Testament,
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.700]   second part, New Testament.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.860]   First part, Old Testament is about God's relationship
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.340]   with the people of Israel.
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.420]   He had something called a covenant,
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.580]   which is a relationship that he had with this nation
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.900]   called Israel.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.060]   And he basically said, hey, if you worship and follow me,
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.400]   it's gonna go really well for you.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.480]   If you worship foreign gods, which by the way, are not real,
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.680]   but if you worship them,
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.740]   I'm gonna let you be ruled by foreign rulers.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.940]   So worship me, things go well, worship foreign gods,
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.260]   they don't, and you'll be conquered by foreign rulers.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.420]   They'll all give you over to foreign rulers.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.420]   In this period, the nation of Israel had rebelled
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.340]   against God, they were not listening, so God was like,
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.020]   hey, I told you this is what's gonna happen,
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.060]   you're basically in time out.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.860]   And he sends this empire called the Babylonian Empire.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.740]   Okay, this is going somewhere.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.660]   They come in, a guy named Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.060]   you may have heard the story of Daniel and all that,
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.060]   but it's in the book of Daniel.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.980]   And basically he comes in and he's like, hey,
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.940]   I'm now the ruler of you guys and the rest of the world
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.500]   and this incredible kingdom.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.600]   And he would do something really interesting.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.980]   When he would go in and conquer,
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.420]   he would basically take the best of the best from a city.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.980]   So he goes into Jerusalem, says, I want top 10%.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.980]   If you're in the top 10%, you are coming with me.
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.820]   Top 10% in looks and gifts, intelligence, any arena.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.020]   You're coming with me, and he made them slaves.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.620]   So they lived underneath this and God was like,
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.340]   I told you, you need to worship me.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.780]   It goes well, you worship foreign gods,
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.200]   you're gonna have foreign rulers.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.860]   But the people didn't listen, they conquered,
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.740]   and they had slaves taken to Babylon.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.960]   So then things are going along and this Persian king,
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.560]   so a new empire comes on the scene.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.940]   And the Persian empire comes in and dominates
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.180]   the Babylonian empire and they're like,
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.700]   hey, I'm the new ruler.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.820]   And a guy named Cyrus is basically the ruler
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.460]   of the kingdom of Persia, sets up the biggest empire
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.700]   the world had ever seen, takes out Babylon.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.620]   And he's the most like chill leader, we're told in the Bible.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.700]   We're really told he was a good king.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.100]   Something kind was said about a foreign pagan king.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.900]   Didn't know God, but something nice was said.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.180]   And that he allowed anybody who was slaves,
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.860]   he was like, I don't believe in slaves.
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.300]   You guys can go home if you want to.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.360]   So anyone who was exiled to Babylon could go home.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.260]   And the Persian empire began.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.040]   And inside of this, there was a Jewish person,
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.880]   a part of the family named Mordecai
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.320]   and a girl named Esther.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.640]   And they were some of the exiles
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.480]   that were allowed to return home,
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.840]   but they'd been there and their families
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.200]   for decades and decades.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.720]   They were like, this is the only home I ever known,
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.000]   I'm living here.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.640]   And the story of Esther takes place
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.040]   inside of this timeframe.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.280]   The Persian empire, so today we're gonna look at
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.860]   inside of that story, where this takes place
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.060]   is in modern day Iran in a capital called Susa.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.140]   It was the capital of the Persian empire at that time.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.180]   And we're gonna be introduced
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.500]   to really three characters tonight
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.140]   that are important for the story.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.780]   So the first one would be Xerxes.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.180]   For this, think Jake Gyllenhaal.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.780]   Here he is, Persian king, he's the most powerful.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.860]   There he is, looking good, Jake.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.980]   P90X, man, he's been working out.
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.340]   He's the most powerful, here's what you need to know.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.160]   Xerxes, real story, this is a true thing.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.520]   Hey, he was the most powerful man on the earth,
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.980]   he was the wealthiest person that had ever,
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.420]   he had accumulated riches upon riches,
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.280]   he conquered the known world by his 30s.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.620]   He ruled over from Ethiopia all the way to India.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.740]   He was just an incredible presence,
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.100]   pagan king, did not know God, but that's who he is.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.940]   So you think Jake Gyllenhaal,
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.620]   that's the first character in our story.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.180]   Then we got our girl, Queen E, Esther.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.060]   Who do you think of when you think of her?
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.340]   Bella Hadid.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.860]   Bella Hadid, this could be,
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.420]   if the guys do not know who this is,
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.880]   they're confident because I don't know who it was,
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.320]   but she's apparently a model,
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.360]   famous for taking pictures of herself.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.240]   And this would be kind of who you think of
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.880]   in this kind of Persian, beautiful queen.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.040]   She wins a beauty pageant, we'll see that in just a second.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.880]   And then her uncle is the one who raises her.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.200]   So his name was Mordecai,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.600]   he brings up this orphan girl named Esther, Bella.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.240]   And for uncle, who's the most classic,
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.760]   iconic uncle of all time?
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.360]   There he is, Uncle Jesse, okay?
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.440]   This is Mordecai, these are the three characters
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.940]   in our story, okay, everyone follow me?
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.080]   So there's the king, he's ruling the land,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.180]   he rules millions and millions and millions of people.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.240]   He's over everything, you don't mess with the king.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.080]   Then there's this peasant orphan girl named Esther,
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.560]   who's being raised by her uncle, Mordecai.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.440]   And so we're gonna first dive in and look at the king.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.120]   I'm gonna just play the movie
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.200]   and walk through chapters one and two with you,
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.840]   and then we're gonna look at three takeaways
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.920]   of how you and I can see and know
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.940]   where God is at work around us.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.280]   So I'm gonna start in verse one of chapter one,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.200]   and we will dive in.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.040]   Now these events happened in the days of King Xerxes,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   who reigned over 127 provinces, or you could think nations,
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.280]   stretching from India to Ethiopia.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.080]   At that time, Xerxes ruled his empire from his royal throne
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.280]   in the fortress of Susa, that's the city, that's the capital.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.780]   In the third year of his reign,
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.920]   he gave a banquet for all of his nobles,
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.480]   or royalty and officials,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.480]   and he invited all the military of the Persia and Media,
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.440]   as well as the princes and the nobles of the provinces.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.440]   The celebration lasted 180 days.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.640]   A tremendous display of the opulent wealth of his empire
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.780]   and the pomp and splendor of his majesty.
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.380]   So we're told that Xerxes, first thing,
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.160]   we're told is he gathers together this celebration and party.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.660]   He gathers all the royalty from all the different provinces.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.300]   If you're anybody important, you're coming,
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.020]   and all of the military, commanders and generals,
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.160]   all of you guys come together, we're gonna have a party,
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.600]   an anal party, like a Persian party,
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.020]   'cause we're about to do this for six months,
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.680]   and they go crazy for six months.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.540]   They're just having like an ultimate kegger,
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.520]   and they're partying in the city of Susa.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.540]   That's what's taking place.
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.940]   And this is going on, and eventually,
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.640]   at the end of that time, and here's why he was doing that.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.000]   We know that shortly after this took place,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.180]   he would go in and attempt to conquer Greece.
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.000]   It was the only area of the world, known world,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.280]   that he hadn't conquered.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.960]   And you may have seen the movie "300" or heard of that movie.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.720]   He's about to go do that and try to conquer Greece.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.560]   So he wants to get all the boys together
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.360]   and show 'em how much wealth he has,
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.800]   how much fun he is, and how you hang with me,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.000]   it's gonna go well for you, so let's party.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.420]   And for six months, they throw a party.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.000]   At the end of that six months, he sends everybody home,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.880]   and he's like, man, I just like threw a huge party,
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.560]   and this city hosted thousands of people
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.660]   that came in from out of town.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.480]   Let's throw a local party just for the city here,
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.780]   not for six months, but for seven days.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.500]   So he throws this seven-day party,
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.000]   and at the end of the seven days, here's what happened.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.280]   Oh, and during that seven days,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.060]   there was only one rule, verse eight.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.160]   By edict of the king, so this is the only rule
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.740]   for that feast, no limits were placed on drinking.
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.640]   So it is an open bar, you can have as much as you want,
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.180]   don't listen to anybody who tells you
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.680]   I think you've had enough.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.880]   For the king had instructed all of his palace officials
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.200]   to serve each man as much as he wanted.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.160]   This is not something the Bible is encouraging,
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.080]   it is just telling you what happened.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.920]   At the same time, Queen Vashti, so there's his queen,
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.680]   not Esther, at this point, Vashti,
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.360]   was giving a banquet for all the women
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.480]   in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.760]   On the seventh day of the feast,
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.380]   when King Xerxes was high in spirits because of the wine,
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.760]   which is a nice way of saying he was drunk,
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.320]   he told the seven eunuchs,
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:09.480]   a eunuch is the most unfortunate character in this story.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.520]   Eunuch was somebody who the king castrated
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.400]   to watch over his women.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.000]   That's a bad day when that happens,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.960]   but he had seven eunuchs,
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.520]   there were lots of eunuchs throughout the story,
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.520]   and he says to seven eunuchs who attended him,
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.480]   Mehumane, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha,
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.160]   Zethar, and Carcas, who I'm just reading their names
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.840]   'cause they need some dignity here,
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.840]   and to bring Queen Vashti to him
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.600]   with the royal crown on her head.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.880]   He wanted all the nobles and all the other men
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.860]   to gaze on her beauty, for she was a beautiful woman.
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:57.520]   But when they conveyed the king's order to Queen Vashti,
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.420]   she refused to come.
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.320]   This made the king furious, and he burned with anger.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.540]   So seven-day party's going on,
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.880]   he's hanging out with all of his boys,
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.360]   and he begins to do what guys do
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.720]   whenever they had too much to drink,
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.200]   and they begin to talk dumb.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.280]   And so he's like, hey, dude,
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.760]   have you seen how hot my wife is?
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.840]   Have you, dude, she's the hottest wife around.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.260]   You think Karl's wife is hotter than my wife?
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.100]   You kidding me?
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.360]   No, my wife is the hottest.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.120]   Hey, somebody go get my wife right now
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.160]   and tell her to come in here.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.040]   And scholars believe that when he said that,
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.080]   he wanted to show off her figure and beauty,
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.280]   and so when he says, "And tell her to come wearing the crown,"
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.120]   it may have been the reason she said no,
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.160]   because he said, "Tell her to come wearing only the crown."
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.820]   Again, this guy's not a good dude,
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.360]   but she basically responds and says,
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.920]   "No," the king gets furious,
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.880]   and so then he's left with a problem of,
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.720]   man, you just embarrassed me in front of all of my boys here,
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.400]   and so he turns to the young men around him,
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.880]   and he's like, what should we do?
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.600]   And then it's like this big frat party going together,
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.880]   like, get rid of her, she's not good enough anyways.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.080]   And so he's like, that's fine, let's get rid of her.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.800]   When they conveyed, oh, I'm sorry,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.200]   so if it pleased the king,
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.000]   we suggest that you issue a written decree, verse 19,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.160]   a law of the Persians and the Medes that cannot be revoked.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160]   It should order that Queen Vashti be forever banished
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.040]   from the presence of the king, Xerxes,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.320]   and that the king should choose another queen
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.460]   more worthy than she, chapter two, verse one.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.400]   But after Xerxes' anger had subsided,
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.000]   he began to think about Vashti.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.640]   So he follows their instructions, gets rid of her,
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.960]   I'm gonna find a new king,
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.280]   and then he finally calms down
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.840]   and kind of wakes up the next day,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.160]   not hungover, and he realizes he just made a law
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.760]   that he can't reverse,
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.420]   that he's no longer married to this woman,
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.560]   and he's like, but I need a queen, I need a girl.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.220]   And he begins to think about her,
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.840]   and his boys around him know that,
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.280]   so his young men around him, verse two, suggested,
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.240]   let us search the empire
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.780]   to find beautiful young virgins for the king.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.160]   Let the king appoint agents in each province,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   so each of the 127 provinces,
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.000]   to bring these beautiful young women
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.440]   into the royal harem at the fortress of Susa.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.040]   Hegai, the king's eunuch, in charge of the harem,
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.080]   will see that they're all given beauty treatments.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.320]   After that, the young woman who most pleases the king
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.920]   will be made queen instead of Vashti.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.160]   This advice was very appealing to the king,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.880]   so he put the plan into effect.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   This is crazy that this is in the Bible.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.000]   You see what just happened?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.640]   These guys were like, young, dumb,
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.800]   drinking too much, guys doing,
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.640]   they're like, you know what we need?
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.160]   We need some chicks right now, that's what we need.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.200]   And so here's what we should do.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.600]   We should do like the bachelor Persia
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.160]   meets Miss Persia competition,
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.700]   and we're gonna go to all the provinces,
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.560]   get the most beautiful women that there are,
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.560]   we're gonna take 'em, we're gonna bring 'em here,
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.680]   make 'em beautiful for a year, we were told, later,
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.840]   and we're gonna come together,
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.560]   and they're gonna sleep with the king,
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.760]   and whichever one the king wants to sleep with,
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.600]   that can be his wife.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.960]   Again, this is not something that the Bible's encouraging.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.680]   It's a really terrible, like at this point,
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.800]   if you're reading it, especially as a dad reading this,
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   you're like, oh no, uh-uh.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.520]   I'm like, this feels like the time, God,
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.200]   where you should show up and kill somebody.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.040]   You did it earlier in the Bible.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.480]   Why don't we do that right here?
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.960]   And because it's just like, this is not a good dude.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.280]   Not surrounded by good dudes, it's not condoning it,
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.720]   but it's telling us the path of which the story
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.640]   that we're about to see came about.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.820]   And so they go, they gather, and they get together,
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.400]   all these different women, we're told by a historian
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.440]   at the time that it was 400 women
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.440]   that they bring in to the king's harem.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.280]   And then there's a scene change as they're collecting
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.120]   and gathering these women, and it says this.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.040]   So inside of the movie, there's a scene change.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.520]   We're introduced to our next character, Uncle Jesse.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.800]   At that time, there was a Jewish man
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.820]   in the fortress of Susa whose name was Mordecai,
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.160]   son of Jer.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.800]   He was from the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.360]   He was a descendant of Kish and Shime.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.280]   His family had been among those that King Jehoiachin
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.800]   of Judah had been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.780]   by King Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.800]   So it's just pointing out the fact
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.760]   that he was among those exiled,
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.880]   and though he was released to go back to Jerusalem,
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.120]   he and the next woman we're introduced to
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.640]   stayed in that city.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:21.280]   This man had a very beautiful and lovely young cousin,
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.240]   Hadassah, who was also called Esther.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.640]   When her father and mother died,
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.280]   Mordecai adopted her into his family
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.420]   and raised her as his own daughter.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.640]   So we're told a couple things about Esther.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.000]   One, she was an orphan.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.160]   Two, she had two names.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.360]   She had a Jewish name and a Persian name, Hadassah and Esther.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.240]   As a result of the king's decree,
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.440]   Esther, along with many other women,
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.880]   were brought into the king's harem at the fortress of Susa
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   and placed into Haggai's care.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.280]   Haggai is like the Chris Harrison of this story
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.720]   from "The Bachelor," if you know who that is.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.040]   He's like the dude who's like, "Bring all the ladies here.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.440]   "Sir, I'll get them ready for you,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.360]   "and you can decide from there."
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.420]   Again, I just lost all of the guys on there,
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.000]   but he is the one who's over, again, he's a eunuch,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.640]   and he's over preparing and making sure
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.800]   all of these guys are ready.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.480]   And we're told something happened
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.200]   in his interactions with Esther and him.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.400]   Verse nine, "Haggai was very impressed with Esther."
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.920]   Your translation may say,
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.080]   "Esther found favor in Haggai's eyes,
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.160]   "and he treated her kindly.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.440]   "He quickly ordered a special menu for her,
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.280]   "provided her with beauty treatments,
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.240]   "and he also assigned seven maids,
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.360]   "specially chosen from the king's palace,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   "and he moved her and her maids
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.200]   "into the best place in the harem."
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.040]   She's given special treatment and special favor
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.480]   from this guy who's overseeing her.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.600]   "Esther had not told anyone of her nationality,
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.560]   "that she was Jewish, and family background,
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.680]   "because Mordecai had directed her not to do so."
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.520]   That Mordecai was afraid her Jewish faith
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.840]   may hurt her chances or just impact what happens to her,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.960]   and so he says, "Don't share your faith with anyone."
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.440]   Verse 12, "Then we're told from the author
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.600]   "the rules of the competition
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.040]   "that they're about to be a part of.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.480]   "Before each young woman was taken to the king's bed,"
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.200]   this dude is such a dirtbag,
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.180]   "she was prescribed 12 months of beauty treatments,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.200]   "six months of oil of myrrh,
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.400]   "followed by six months of special perfumes and ointments.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.080]   "When it was time for her to go to the king's palace,
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.000]   "she was given a choice of whatever clothing
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.440]   "or jewelry she wants she wanted to take from the harem.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.040]   "That evening, she was taken into the king's private rooms.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.400]   "The next morning, she was brought out to the second harem
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   "where the king's wives lived.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.480]   "There she would be under the care of Shehagaz,"
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.200]   like a first century rapper, "the king's eunuch,
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.080]   "in charge of the concubines.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.360]   "She would never go to the king again
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.380]   "unless he had especially enjoyed her
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.160]   "and requested her by name."
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.780]   So anyone in the competition,
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.220]   here's what the future you have.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.000]   You either win and you're queen,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.600]   or you spend the rest of your life either as a concubine
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.060]   that has no interaction with the king maybe,
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.060]   or he calls you whenever he essentially wants a booty call,
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.140]   and that's the path you're gonna have.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.680]   You can never marry anybody else.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.100]   It was a law that you sleep with the king.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.580]   You don't get to marry anybody else.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.940]   And yet the king decides,
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.820]   "I'm gonna do whatever I want whenever I want,"
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.500]   and Esther is taken.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.600]   We're told that she's taken.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.700]   In other words, it likely wasn't that she volunteered
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.140]   to be a part of this, but she was taken
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.520]   and was made as a part of these women.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.360]   Esther was taken to the king after a year of preparation.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.820]   I don't know if that excites the girls in this room.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.380]   You get to go to the spa for a year,
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.380]   or if that feels like you're getting ready
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.300]   to be a bridesmaid for a year
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.460]   with people like messing with your hair and getting makeup,
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.780]   but it's some mixture of the two of those that's taking place
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.780]   and after a year of that, Esther's ready and it says this.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.380]   "She was taken to King Xerxes at the royal palace
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.540]   "in early winter of the seventh year of his reign,
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.060]   "and the king loved Esther
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.680]   "more than any of the other young women.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.960]   "He was so delighted with her
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.180]   "that he set the royal crown on her head
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.780]   "and he declared her queen instead of Vashti."
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.100]   So she goes in, sleeps with the king,
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.940]   and God turns the heart of the king
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.780]   to love her more than anybody else.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.460]   He says, "The competition is over.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.180]   "I found the girl, Queen Esther."
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.480]   Puts the crown on her head.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.380]   She's declared the queen.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.560]   It's a crazy story.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.580]   It's a story that it looks like anything
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.780]   but God being at work.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.700]   And yet, when you look and you see
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.660]   all the different ways that God was clearly
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.420]   turning people's hearts, positioning people
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.140]   in specific places, he was clearly at work
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.180]   because here's what just happened.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.260]   Esther was just placed to the position of queen
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.600]   and she's now in prime placement
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.380]   to become the savior of the nation
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.540]   and that's gonna happen in a few chapters later.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.020]   It's the ultimate rags to riches
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.820]   where she goes from riffraff street rat
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.500]   to now she's in the palace
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.460]   and she is at the right hand of the king.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.780]   In the midst of all this, God clearly is at work
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.140]   and the book was written so that the people of Israel
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.620]   would know even when it seems chaotic and out of control,
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.460]   you can know that God is at work.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.980]   The first thing I just wanna talk about
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.180]   that we learned from this passage
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.100]   is that God is at work even when it looks like he's not.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.280]   God is at work even when it looks like he's not.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.460]   Not just when it kinda looks like God's at work always,
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.100]   when it looks like this doesn't feel
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.620]   like anybody's at the wheel.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.700]   God is absolutely at the wheel
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.580]   and he's moving the pieces around
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.660]   and he's bringing about his purposes
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.900]   in spite of people who don't know him,
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.460]   don't work with him, don't live
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.540]   in the direction that he's called people to live.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.740]   This would look, I mean think about the story.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.100]   There's a king, he gets drunk, he decides like,
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.780]   hey, I want my wife to come in here
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.460]   and dance around for us a little bit and she won't.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.380]   He's like, screw you and then he does a beauty contest
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.260]   and 400 people come and this drunk, anger king
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.040]   ends up marrying this Jewish girl
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.800]   who sleeps with him and has sex with him
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.460]   before they got married and she marries a non-believer.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.060]   It's not the type of scenario where if it happened today
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.140]   where people would be like,
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.700]   dude, that's clearly a God thing, wow.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.060]   This is synonymous with like Monica Lewinsky,
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.420]   Bill Clinton thing where people are like,
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.980]   dude, that feels like an answer prayer to me, huh?
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.540]   It's like, what?
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.140]   And yet, God was clearly at work
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.340]   that he brings about in despite all the ways
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.180]   that this king was not living in a way
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.060]   that God would condone, God was clearly saying,
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.300]   I'm gonna move all of these things around for my purposes
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.940]   because I'm always at work even when it looks like I'm not.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.340]   God is working through and in the midst of,
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.140]   at a high level and in the details
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.540]   of each one of our lives.
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.640]   Like he's in control no matter what's taking place
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.480]   in the world around us.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.060]   He's at work even when it looks like he's not.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.820]   It's the message or one of the big themes
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.540]   of the first two chapters.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.060]   He's at work through every authority
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.800]   that's been placed in our world,
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.580]   whether that's in terms of whoever, you know,
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.940]   primaries today, whoever's elected president,
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.700]   whoever's ever in the Senate, a leader of a foreign nation,
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.500]   he's over and moving all of those.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.860]   He's over all of them and he's at work
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.380]   and he's bringing about his purposes
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.260]   even when it doesn't seem like it
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.900]   or even when we can't see it, scripture says.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.620]   Romans chapter 13 says that every authority
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.620]   has been established by God, both good and bad.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.020]   Romans chapter 13, verse one and two says,
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.780]   for all authority comes from God.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.140]   Think about this.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.980]   Those in positions of authority
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.780]   have been placed there by God.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.880]   Anyone who rebels against authority
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.740]   is rebelling against what God has instituted
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.980]   and they will be punished.
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.860]   Did you just say that every authority,
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.540]   like my boss who's a total jerk,
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.180]   was placed there by God?
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.020]   Yes.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:57.260]   The president who sits in the White House right now
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.280]   was placed there by God.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.060]   The president who will sit there in 12 months
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.400]   is placed there by God.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.820]   Is God always in fan of every single action
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.020]   that every president has ever done?
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.780]   No, but he's over and he uses all of that
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.500]   in every shortcoming because there hasn't ever been
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.260]   any perfect president and there hasn't ever been
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.120]   any perfect leader anywhere.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.860]   And yet he's over and moving all the different pieces around
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.540]   for his purposes to take place.
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.180]   Is the Bible saying that hey, if my authority,
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.180]   my boss, someone over me is asking me
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.900]   to do something that is sin or contradicts God's word,
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.040]   I need to do it?
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.880]   No.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.660]   Because then there's a higher authority involved
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.500]   which is God.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.260]   And we have to decide or have to say,
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.580]   hey, look, you're asking me to go to strip club for work
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.780]   and you're just saying that's what you do?
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.620]   That's not what I do.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.620]   That's not what I think is right
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.780]   and I can't do that because of my faith.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.300]   And so if that means I lose my job, that's okay.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.120]   I trust you.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.420]   I trust God.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.500]   And this is that, but every authority,
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.480]   it says all of it, he's moving all of the different pieces
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.900]   around.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.300]   God's at work even when we can't see it
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.140]   to bring about things.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:06.140]   And sometimes you just see how despite tragic things
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.060]   that happen that God didn't cause,
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.020]   he's clearly a part of it
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.540]   or he clearly brings about good in spite of it.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.580]   Like you guys know the Holocaust
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:14.420]   which happened in World War II
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.900]   and just the tragic atrocities happening
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.380]   that happened through the Holocaust
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.020]   of millions of Jewish people losing lives.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.660]   You know one of the things that was a clear fulfillment
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.060]   of prophecy that happened after that?
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:30.300]   The nation of Israel was given a land,
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.340]   a location.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.780]   In other words, as a result of that,
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:33.740]   nations got together and were like,
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.920]   we should give these guys a place they can go to
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.420]   and gather and the nation of Israel was formed
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.940]   after hundreds and hundreds of years
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.180]   of not having a nation.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.020]   I don't know if you know that.
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.380]   It's not like it's, look up Israel 1938.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.300]   Doesn't exist.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.180]   Happened after World War II.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.060]   And despite all of the horrificness of that,
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.640]   God moved the things around and he fulfills a prophecy
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.960]   that they would be established having a land
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.260]   and he brings that about.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.900]   In the midst of all the different evil,
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.620]   'cause you can be left with a question
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.220]   of like God's work when it doesn't look like it,
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.320]   why doesn't he step in and stop more evil in our world?
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.960]   Stop more suffering that takes place?
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.580]   Like why doesn't he stop school shootings
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.780]   or terrorism or viruses outbreaking?
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.980]   And to that I would say,
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.280]   how do you know he's not all the time?
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.240]   Every single moment that there isn't an outbreak
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.260]   of utter evil is because God holds it back at bay
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.780]   in a world that's full of evil and brokenness and chaos.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.500]   At every moment there's not a school shooting
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.900]   is a moment he stopped it.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.300]   And every moment there's not a virus
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.820]   that's exploding and breaking out
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.560]   is a moment he stopped it.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.300]   And yet in his sovereign will,
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.720]   there's times where it allows,
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.820]   but we're not told why we are told that he will
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.660]   allow even the worst of circumstances to be used
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.500]   and brought about for good.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.220]   And I don't know how he's gonna do all of that
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.140]   with certain things, just to be candid.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.580]   And any answer I would give you right now,
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.460]   it's not gonna satisfy you.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.500]   Certainly it doesn't satisfy me.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.900]   How do you reconcile sexual abuse, God?
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.460]   How is that a part of your sovereign plan?
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.620]   Why would you even allow that?
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.700]   And I don't know.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:14.540]   You know, the divorce that has ripped apart my family's home
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.380]   and my family and just all of the different pain
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.220]   that was caused as a result of my father having an affair
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.100]   or whatever your story is,
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.180]   how do you reconcile and make that good, God?
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.220]   And I don't know.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.040]   But we're told in Ecclesiastes chapter three,
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.920]   even the worst of things, verse 11,
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.600]   God will make beautiful in its time, everything.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.200]   There's gonna come a day and a moment where you look
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.220]   and the worst and most broken things that he allowed,
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.220]   he didn't cause.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:46.280]   But when you were the victim
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.560]   of some painful moments like that,
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.860]   I don't even know that the difference matters.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.680]   'Cause it still happened.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.360]   And we're not told how,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.280]   we are told that when everything is made new,
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.960]   there's gonna come a moment where make everything beautiful
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.480]   and woven together in its time,
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.320]   even the worst of things that you experience.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.760]   It's like this.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.420]   Here's a bunch of random kind of ingredients
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.320]   that are up here that in and of themselves
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.600]   are no one would want to eat.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.880]   Like this is a bunch of flour.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.240]   Like you wouldn't want to eat a cup of flour
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.800]   unless you're on Fear Factor
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.240]   and there's money on the line or something.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.880]   Or like butter unless you're just doing
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.000]   some bulletproof coffee.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.120]   Or eggs, no one wants to go eat eggs
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.320]   unless you're a guest on or like a Uber CrossFit guy in here.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.880]   Or vanilla, like things that in and of themselves,
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.240]   you're like, man, did I lose a bet I have to eat that stuff?
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.900]   That doesn't taste good at all.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.800]   What's crazy is when you take all those different things
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.000]   and you put them together in the hands of a baker,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.840]   you make something that just made people be like, ooh.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.880]   That tastes amazing.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.360]   These things that in and of themselves,
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.200]   they don't taste good at all.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.760]   Like you couldn't pay me to eat that.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.700]   And then you put them in the hands of somebody
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.200]   who's a gifted baker and they make something
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.840]   that tastes delicious out of it.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.520]   That's what the scripture says.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.200]   Whether you believe it or not, that's what it says.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.960]   That hey, there's gonna come moments where it's like,
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.400]   dude, this is flour.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.040]   This is, what I'm walking through right now
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.200]   does not taste right.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.920]   But it promises that God, there's gonna come a moment
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.040]   where he makes everything beautiful in its time
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.400]   and all of it woven together for good, for yours and mine.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.200]   If you know and love God, it promises.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.040]   And even when it doesn't look like he's working, he is.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.680]   Second thing that we see in this text
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.760]   is that God is at work in the details.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.200]   God is at work in the details of life.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.760]   That God is bringing about his plans and his purposes
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:50.400]   through the details of her life and your life.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.840]   You think about her, she's in the city of Susa,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.720]   which is not like any other,
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.540]   she could have been in any city in the kingdom.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.440]   She finds herself in the capital city.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.920]   She's worked through her beauty, the way that she was made,
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.200]   like the way that she was formed and put together.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.000]   God was sovereign and he was over all of that
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.200]   and weaving it together.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.520]   He was over Haggai, the name of Chris Harrison,
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.520]   having favor with her.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.360]   He was over the king having favor with her.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.240]   And he is over the details of your life.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.400]   He is at work, he's bringing it about,
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.680]   and he's sovereign over the things
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.560]   that are taking place inside of your life.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.760]   We're told in the scripture that he's sovereign
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.320]   over how you are made.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.740]   That's the color of your skin, the way that you look,
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.800]   that he formed everything about you,
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.300]   the personality that you have.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:38.400]   In Psalm 139, verse 13, it says,
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.200]   "God created and knit you together in your mother's womb.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.520]   "I praise you because I'm fearfully and wonderfully made."
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.640]   Matthew chapter 10, verse 29 says,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.920]   "Even the hairs of your head are numbered."
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.860]   Think about that.
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:58.000]   Every hair on your head, numbered.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.240]   That's the level of detail to which God knows you.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.400]   We're told that he's sovereign over the places
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.240]   that you live.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.020]   Proverbs chapter 16, verses eight and nine says,
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.180]   "We make our plans, but the Lord directs our steps."
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.380]   Like you think it's random you live in Dallas,
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.320]   or you think it's like a curse you live in Dallas,
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.400]   or I don't know what you think,
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.720]   wherever you live that you're listening in.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.980]   Like you think like, oh man, it's just,
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.560]   I didn't even get the job that I wanted to,
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.720]   and I wanted to be in Atlanta.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.880]   That's where all my friends ended up,
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.720]   and the only job that I got was in Dallas,
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   and so that's why I'm here.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.760]   It's not because I wanna be here,
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.840]   'cause God was like, oh, go to Dallas.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.020]   That's why I'm here.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.200]   And the truth is, it's not random.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.280]   He's in the details, and he has you here.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.560]   He even has you in this room for a purpose,
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.360]   and he's intimately at work in the details
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.440]   of your life, of my life,
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.660]   just like he was in the story of Esther.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.080]   He's at work in where you worked today,
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.680]   or the career that you have.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.000]   Like God is over all those things.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   They are not random, biblically speaking.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.080]   They're part of a plan that he's unfolding.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.840]   I was at a restaurant in town called Taco Cinco,
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.240]   which I think is the best chips and salsa in Dallas.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.340]   I'm gonna go on record.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.140]   I know that's crazy, and I'm probably gonna get more emails
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.320]   about that comment right there
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.840]   than anything else that I say.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.960]   But I was in there, and I was with a friend.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.240]   We were eating lunch, and talking to the waitress.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.280]   She came up, and she was serving us.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.100]   Her name was Sarah.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.080]   I began to ask Sarah, "Where are you from?"
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.340]   and just kind of walked through,
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.640]   just getting to visit with her a little bit.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.880]   And then at some point, I asked her,
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.000]   "Hey, what do you know about the name Sarah?"
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.840]   And she said, "I know it's Persian for princess."
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.520]   And I said, "It does mean princess.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.200]   "Do you know where your name comes from?"
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.760]   And she was like, "Persia?"
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.520]   And I was like, "It's from a book, actually, the Bible."
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.900]   And she said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's in the Bible."
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.840]   And I said, "What do you know about the story of Sarah?"
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.660]   And I walked her through.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.160]   She was a part of this covenant relationship
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.720]   that God had with the people at that time
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.140]   through Abraham, her husband,
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.400]   and that Sarah was a part of that.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.240]   And that covenant today has been fulfilled in Jesus,
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.720]   and that anybody who trusts not in how good of a person
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.640]   they are, how bad of a person they are,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.480]   but in what Jesus did on the cross,
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.360]   dying for them, paying for their sin,
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.720]   once and fully and finally,
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.160]   everything wrong they've ever done, paid for,
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.500]   he died in their place, and he rose.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.820]   He was buried and rose from the dead,
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:14.020]   showing the payment for the sin of all mankind
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:14.860]   was more than enough.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.580]   If anyone trusts in that free gift, not in themselves,
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.480]   they're gonna have eternal life,
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.320]   and they're a part of that covenant people
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.640]   that God has invited all of us to be a part of.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.520]   And I said something to her that is true.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.960]   I said, "You know what's crazy, Sarah?"
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.120]   This is gonna sound weird, you're gonna think that's crazy,
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:36.120]   is I think God brought us here so that we could tell you that
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.480]   and we could tell you He hadn't forgotten you,
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.480]   He knows your name, He cares about you,
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.040]   and He loves you.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.640]   Biblically, that is incredibly true, without question true.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   We're told in Acts chapter 17 that God appoints
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.260]   the boundaries and the times in which people live,
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.720]   the moments, all of them, He's moving the pieces around.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.720]   And in that moment, He's saying,
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.020]   "Hey, I'm gonna bring you here to that person."
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:59.800]   And she looked at me and kinda had his face,
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.320]   and then I said, "Because we're angels."
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.680]   And no, I didn't say that at all.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.520]   What if I did?
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.320]   And then just slowly vanished away.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.200]   And no, that part didn't happen.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.680]   But God's over it, He's over even that moment
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.920]   of who's gonna be at that table.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.540]   And as God's people, we just have to have the eyes to see
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.680]   and to remember that He's moving the pieces all around,
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.960]   He's sovereign of the places they work,
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.440]   He's intimately at work in the details of your life.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.120]   He's over even the fact that the king's heart chose her,
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.800]   that He wanted to have that relationship with her.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.820]   The king, we're told, he falls in love with her,
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:41.180]   we're told in Proverbs 22, verse one, 21, verse one,
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.380]   "The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord,
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.200]   like rivers of water, he turns it wherever he wishes."
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.520]   You know who's over the hearts of people around you,
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.280]   like your boss's perception of you,
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   whatever he thinks about you?
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.740]   You know who's over more of that than you are,
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.940]   who has more control over that than you do?
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.180]   God.
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.340]   Whatever people's perception of you and the relationship
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.700]   and the way somebody feels towards you,
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.280]   you know who has more control over that than you do?
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.320]   God.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.180]   More control over that than even they do?
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.020]   God.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.880]   That He turns it and He's like, "Esther, she's your girl."
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.780]   And you can walk in a confidence knowing that,
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.960]   man, hey, I can either try to always be defending myself
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.920]   and always concerned about what other people think about me,
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.780]   or I can walk knowing that, hey, God,
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.760]   you know everything that they feel,
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.760]   you know everything that they think,
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.480]   I'm gonna trust you with the perceptions
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.600]   that others have of me.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.500]   You're the king of hearts.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.720]   And Esther experienced that king of hearts
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.720]   turning his heart because God is in the details.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.880]   I remember there was a moment,
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.080]   and knowing that allows us to face things
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.080]   where it's like, it doesn't look like
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.160]   he's clearly doing that here.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.480]   I remember when I was dating my wife
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.320]   and we were in college and we came to that moment,
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.080]   kind of like ring by spring, where you're like,
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.840]   hey, are we gonna move forward here or not?
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.500]   And we were at a place where we just weren't ready
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.800]   for the relationship to move forward.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.580]   And so we broke up.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.060]   And that was terrible.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.080]   Every breakup is horrible.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.840]   And we had dated well, relatively speaking.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.240]   And it was brutal and it was painful.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.840]   And we broke up for two years.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.880]   And in those moments, when that was going down
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.560]   and happening, especially initially,
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.300]   it was so painful, like, God, what are you doing?
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.220]   We invested all this relational time.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.000]   This is not something either of us wanted to experience,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.120]   but we knew this is not the time to move forward
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.020]   and may never be.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:31.240]   And two years went by and it became more of that time
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.520]   where God had the relationship move forward.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.760]   But here's, despite the fact that I didn't want that
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.480]   to happen, I never would have thought that would be God
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.000]   a part of that, my faith in those two years
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.920]   that we were separated grew like it had never grown
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.960]   in my entire life.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.360]   I just started working here.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.400]   I was going to seminary and studying.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.960]   And the way that God just got a hold of my heart
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.440]   was unique compared to all the other years I've lived.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.520]   And I look back and I think that's some of the most
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.840]   developmental time I've ever had.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.640]   And that God was in the midst of all of that.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.720]   I don't know what you're walking through.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.120]   I don't know what you're facing, but I do know
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.700]   that God is at work in the details of your life.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:13.600]   And then finally, God is at work through imperfect people.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.320]   God is at work through imperfect people.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.480]   The text, like this may surprise you.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.740]   Here's the challenge with Esther.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.000]   A lot of people come in and they're like, dude, Esther,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.400]   favorite girl in the whole Bible.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.560]   Like she's slay queen, she's the goals.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.240]   She's my favorite.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.040]   She's not in this chapter a great example of what to do.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.480]   Like truly, she's a girl.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.800]   No one would say this is a recipe for success.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.720]   You're gonna marry a non-believer, have sex with them
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.160]   before you get married, along with like 400 other girls
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.000]   that have sex with them.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.160]   And you're gonna end up living regardless in his house
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.560]   and don't tell anybody about your faith.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.520]   And you probably should be in Jerusalem anyways.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.360]   She's not a recipe of someone to follow.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.880]   But despite all of that, God is at work
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.220]   through imperfect people because he's always at work
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.480]   through imperfect people.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.400]   How do we know that scripturally,
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.400]   she wasn't supposed to have sex even in the Old Testament?
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.060]   Exodus chapter 22 says that people, men and women, Esther,
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.960]   was not to have sex before marriage.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.680]   Deuteronomy chapter seven, verse two and four
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.480]   said that you were not to marry people
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.900]   who did not worship the one true God, Yahweh.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.240]   Matthew chapter 10 talks about, hey,
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.760]   anyone who does not acknowledge me before men,
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.000]   I will not acknowledge.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.360]   So if you hide your faith, it's a reflection
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.360]   of a weak faith that you're not to have.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:46.280]   What's challenging or what is maybe a result
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.240]   that let me just clarify quickly
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.560]   because in case that's shocking to you,
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.780]   it's probably because of a couple things.
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.880]   The first, let me just high level teach
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.480]   like some of what the Bible is.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.840]   The Bible has things involved in it
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.680]   that are stories that are descriptive
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.160]   and then things that are prescriptive.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.000]   Prescriptive is like a prescription, do this.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.720]   Descriptive is like, this is what happened and it was crazy.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.160]   And that happens all throughout the Bible.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.040]   There's a lot of stories that are descriptive,
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:12.880]   not prescriptive.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.480]   In other words, you should not do this type of thing.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.020]   And then there's commands that are prescriptive
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.800]   that are instructions on how to live,
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.260]   how to handle alcohol, sexuality, how to live your life,
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.060]   care for your family, how you should bring up your kids.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.240]   Those are prescriptive.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.480]   This is a story that is descriptive inside of scripture.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.080]   The second thing that may clarify
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.680]   why Esther is not a great example, at least in this chapter,
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.540]   and she's not the good guy in this part of the story,
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.920]   at least, is a fundamental misunderstanding
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.760]   of what the Bible is.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.880]   So this is really important in case like you two me out
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.960]   and you're counting these little wood things over here.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.000]   So come back.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.440]   A lot of you guys don't read the Bible right.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.000]   Like you don't understand what it actually is.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   And I'm not trying to insult you, it's just true.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.780]   You think the Bible is a book that's a bunch of like,
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.480]   hey, there's some good people and then there's some bad
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.020]   people and you wanna try to be like the good people.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.340]   That's not what the Bible is.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.500]   The Bible is a bunch of bad guys
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.620]   and one good guy named Jesus.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.320]   And the bad guys are so bad,
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.760]   they kill the one good guy named Jesus.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.940]   And so Esther, just like every other person in the Bible,
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.380]   is not one of the good guys.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.600]   She's one of the bad guys,
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.180]   but God uses imperfect, broken bad guys.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.140]   And you may be going, what?
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:20.980]   That's not true.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:21.800]   What about Noah?
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.620]   He built that ark, got all those animals on there.
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.660]   That was awesome.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.540]   Noah, after he got done with that ark,
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.340]   found himself at sea, ended up being,
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.700]   dry land came eventually.
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.300]   You know one of the first things we're told about Noah
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.660]   whenever he got off that ark?
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.420]   He built a vineyard and got hammered
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.380]   and he walked around naked and his kids were like,
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.680]   dad, this is gross.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.820]   Oh my gosh.
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.980]   That's in the Bible.
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:42.220]   That's Noah.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.620]   Abraham, let's go to the next one.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.580]   Abraham, Abraham pimps out his wife two different times.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.820]   In other words, he's like, hey,
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.780]   I think they're gonna kill me if I say you're my wife
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.440]   'cause you're a looker and they may end up
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.120]   wanting to take you so they'll kill me.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.760]   So let's just say you're my sister.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.520]   And his sister ends up being taken in the room of a king.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.560]   Two different times, the same exact story happened.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.780]   Then he sleeps with the maid and gets her pregnant.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.160]   Is that a guy that you're like,
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.240]   that's my hero right there.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.360]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.360]   King David, King David, man after God's own heart.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.440]   Slay Goliath, lots of good things.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.120]   He's a guy who has an affair,
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.480]   convinced adultery with one of his closest friends' wives.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.400]   And then she gets pregnant and he's like, okay.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.840]   And he can't get him, his friend to come home
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.100]   to make it look like she got her pregnant
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.420]   so he just kills his friend.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.960]   And then you're like, yeah, everyone has a bad day.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.300]   Let's go with that, okay.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.060]   From his deathbed, King David from his deathbed.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.920]   You know what he asks his son to do?
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.880]   He puts out a hit on another guy's life.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.360]   He's like, yeah, and by the way, I'm about to die.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.700]   And I think you should kill that guy.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.200]   That's a part of 1 Kings chapter two.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   But David, as he's dying, puts a hit out like a mafia boss.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.880]   It's not a bunch of stories about good guy and good guys
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.120]   and try to be like good guys.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.120]   It's a story of a bunch of broken, messed up people.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.400]   And God is the hero in the midst of the story.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.800]   And Esther is no different.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.920]   What Esther, 'cause the interpretive challenge is then,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.200]   dude, well, you can do whatever you want.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.200]   You can sleep before marriage, marry whoever you want,
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.360]   and God can still use it to bring you about good.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.200]   Two problems with that.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:18.500]   One is that all of us are accountable for what you know.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.480]   We don't know what Esther knew.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.000]   We don't know if she had access to Old Testament Bible.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.520]   We don't know what she knew.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.660]   But if you're in this room tonight,
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.280]   you've been exposed to the truth
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.780]   that God in the scriptures has called us
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.620]   to date in certain ways, live in certain ways,
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.400]   marry certain people, believers,
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.880]   who share that same faith as you.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.400]   James chapter four, verse seven says,
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.240]   "He who knows the right thing to do
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.460]   and does not do it for him, it is sin."
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.360]   We do not know exactly all that Esther knew,
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.660]   but we know what you know.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.560]   The second thing is in Esther doing that,
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:58.000]   she forfeited a story that could have showcased
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.600]   God working with people who follow his will
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.800]   in an incredible way.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.920]   In other words, we wouldn't be sitting here
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.960]   2,500 years later going, hey,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.240]   and this is not exactly a great example to follow here.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.080]   God can redeem anything,
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.100]   but this is not a recipe for success.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.480]   We would be sitting here going, wow, look at her courage.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.000]   Had she gone in and the king and said,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.560]   hey, you took me away from my family,
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.800]   but I'm not gonna have sex with you
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.020]   because I believe that sex is for marriage,
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.840]   so I'm gonna sleep with my husband.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.280]   Let's say the king didn't kill her there,
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.200]   and he's like, all right, man, feisty.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.080]   Want what you can't have?
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.280]   Let's get married.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.820]   And if she looked at him and said,
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:39.200]   no, I can only marry people who worship the one true God,
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.520]   maybe he would have said, get out of here, go home.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.120]   That's an exciting story.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.020]   Maybe he would have said, tell me more.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.120]   Maybe he would have converted to Judaism
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.400]   and worshiped the one true God.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.200]   We have no idea.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.600]   You know what happens when a king converts,
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.800]   a nation converts.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.960]   It could have been an entirely different story,
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.080]   and she forfeited seeing God show up
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.960]   and be faithful to his promises and his people
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.100]   by her being obedient and faithful to him.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.640]   Many of you are gonna forfeit
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.960]   seeing God show up in your life,
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.040]   just like Esther did,
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.940]   because you're not actually willing to be obedient,
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.880]   and you're not gonna see him work.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   Two people came down in the last couple weeks,
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.080]   different stories in both their lives,
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.680]   but they were in a similar circumstance.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.960]   One was in a situation where they're like,
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.000]   hey, I'm living with my boyfriend.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.280]   I just don't know what to do.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.120]   You know, we've been talking about
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.380]   how that's not a great thing,
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.120]   but I feel like maybe I should move out.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.800]   The exact same story with somebody else was taking place.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.680]   Both of them came down.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.600]   One of them, and they both had hearts that were like,
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.960]   I think maybe I shouldn't be living with him.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.800]   Will you pray for me?
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.620]   I'm scared.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:39.600]   I became a Christian,
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.320]   and I think I need to move out.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.020]   Both of them were in that same place.
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:48.320]   One of them decided to actually act on that,
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.920]   and the other one decided to say,
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.120]   I know God says that's what I should do,
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.400]   but I don't care,
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.280]   and I'm just gonna try to look the other way.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.800]   And you know what she forfeited?
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.960]   One, marrying a godly husband,
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.580]   and two, at least being in that search,
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.120]   if she doesn't change the direction of her dating scenario
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.220]   of continuing to live with a guy,
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.840]   and two, she forfeited seeing God show up.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.040]   And the other girl decided,
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.320]   hey, I'm gonna do it, and I'm scared,
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.600]   and I've lived with him two and a half years,
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.000]   but I'm gonna make the decision to move out.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.120]   And she saw God show up by the people of God coming around,
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.320]   and God showed and provided a house,
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.200]   that hey, you can come live in this bedroom.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.960]   She was concerned 'cause she didn't have a car,
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.040]   and she had to walk to work,
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.480]   and she was like, if I move to someplace else,
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.360]   how am I gonna get to work?
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.640]   And then all of a sudden, the people of God are like,
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.000]   hey, you can use this car.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   And she got to see God at work
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.120]   in the midst of her obedience.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.340]   When you and I forfeit and are disobedient
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.180]   to following God's way,
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.960]   you forfeit seeing God show up,
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.300]   just like Esther in this story,
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.600]   forfeit again to see God show up to save his people.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.380]   In conclusion, God is always at work,
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.380]   even when it looks like he's not.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.140]   He's at work in the details of your life right now.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.460]   Who you are, the way that you look,
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.860]   the place that you live, he's at work.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.620]   And God is at work and has always been at work
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:03.820]   through imperfect people.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.780]   He is the hero of the book of Esther.
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:06.820]   He's the hero of the story.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.880]   He's the hero of the entire Bible.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:10.960]   And the point of Christianity
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.680]   is not how great any one of us is,
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.940]   it's that we have found a savior hero named Jesus.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.400]   It's the point of Esther, it's the point of the whole story.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.960]   He's the solution.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.400]   He saves the queen.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.300]   And he's the savior of anyone who will trust in him.
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.400]   Let me wrap up like this.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.620]   The crazy thing about the coronavirus thing,
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.600]   which is really not that bad, just FYI,
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.120]   in terms of symptoms and the flu is probably worse,
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.860]   but now I'm gonna get an email on that
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.460]   from somebody in the medical community.
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.640]   Crazy thing about that, I think,
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.820]   is that the contagiousness of it
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.080]   and two weeks being dormant
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.280]   where you can't tell if somebody has it
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.620]   and just eventually the symptoms begin to pop up
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.080]   and you can see the virus
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.820]   that you can't see with the human eye,
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.280]   but you can see the presence and evidence of it
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.960]   showing up in somebody's life.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:03.300]   And just the ways that it even spreads from there.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.980]   And how much craziness and just people obsessed
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.080]   about like, "Oh no, what are we gonna do?"
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.060]   And we should do, should be wise
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:13.340]   and use Lysol and all that stuff.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.900]   But there's a much more serious virus
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:22.860]   that likewise has also infiltrated into the human race.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.820]   And it's a virus that you can see the evidence of it
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:26.660]   all around us.
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:27.940]   You can't always see the presence of it
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.020]   like infecting someone,
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:31.920]   but you can see the symptoms of the infection.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.420]   And that is a virus called SYN.
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.940]   And unlike the virus of a coronavirus
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.480]   that takes two and a hundred,
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:42.080]   this is a virus that has killed 100 for 100 people.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.280]   And there is a solution for it,
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.960]   but it is not some vaccine or some medical procedure.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.180]   It is a savior named Jesus.
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:52.000]   What do I mean by like the symptoms of this virus
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.840]   that comes in?
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.340]   Like you can see, and even if you're not a Christian,
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.280]   listen to me very closely.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.540]   You know there's messed up things in your life
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.940]   and in the lives of people around you
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:02.060]   that you were like, dude, that's probably not right.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.340]   You could see the evidence of the symptoms of this virus
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.700]   that come in and they begin to infect somebody.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.420]   And that infection leads to them being addicted
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.100]   to looking at naked pictures of men and women
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.840]   on the internet having sex together.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:12.680]   Think about that.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.500]   All of a sudden they're like, man, I just can't stop
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.820]   because of this virus has begun to infect.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.200]   The virus, sometimes you see the evidence
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.900]   of like the infection in somebody's life
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.980]   and that they eat food and then they purge it up
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.380]   because they just hate the way that they look
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:27.340]   and they're reaching for control
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:29.900]   and they can't face this life
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.380]   without having something they can control.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.980]   And it's because that infection,
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:35.660]   those are just symptoms of the virus of sin that is there.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:38.780]   That virus is the reason why many of you like my home
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:42.380]   was ripped apart through parents divorcing
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:45.120]   because sin came in and you didn't see it exactly
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.100]   all the way come in, but you saw the evidence of it
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.060]   and the destruction take place.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:54.980]   Evidence of the virus you can see around us
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:01.420]   in the ways that racial division still marks
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.160]   so many people inside of our country.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.380]   Evidence of the virus in my life I can see
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:13.980]   through sexual desires for people who are not my wife,
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:18.100]   anger, greed that can mark my heart,
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.520]   selfishness that doesn't care about people,
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.940]   the way that God says I'm to care about people,
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.420]   and it's all symptoms of the virus.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:25.260]   But here's the good news.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.420]   Unlike in that scenario with the coronavirus,
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.060]   there isn't really a solution to the virus.
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.220]   There is one for this.
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:34.980]   And there's a solution to the symptoms in your life,
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:38.020]   but it is not you trying harder or you reading some book.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.540]   It is you trusting in a savior.
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.060]   And when you do that, that savior begins to promise
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:44.940]   you will one day be delivered from the penalty of sin.
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.100]   And that virus and the presence of sin
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.020]   will one day forever be gone.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.340]   And this world will rise again,
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.180]   just like Jesus rose from the dead and it will be healed.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.780]   And now you can begin to experience freedom
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.740]   from the power of sin because the Holy Spirit
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.140]   begins to come into your life and save and purge
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.500]   everything that's hurting you from your life
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.140]   and everything that's hurting me.
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:13.620]   There is one savior, one hero, one solution
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:17.500]   to the disease that is far more deadly
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.540]   than anything our world has ever seen.
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.220]   And many of you have never trusted in that.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.360]   And tragically, you think that you can save yourself.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.360]   You think that you can, through whatever you do,
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.120]   earn a relationship with God and you have bought a lie.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.240]   And you feel like you need to clean yourself up
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.480]   a little bit or get things together.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.240]   And then God, you know, work on your relationship
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.520]   and you know, just read a little bit more Bible
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.160]   and then you'll get there and you have bought a bunch of BS.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.520]   One of the greatest lies our world has bought
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.800]   specifically in America is that good people go to heaven,
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.900]   bad people go to hell.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:54.240]   Biblically, forgiven people go to heaven.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.540]   And there is one way to get forgiveness.
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.800]   His name is Jesus.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.520]   Let me pray.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.620]   Father, thank you for the story of Esther.
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:10.560]   It showcases when we can't see you, you're working.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:14.660]   You work in imperfect, broken people.
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.800]   You bring about your purposes, nothing can thwart
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.840]   your hand, your plans, your sovereign and your good.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.340]   And you invite us who know you to call you Father.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:29.720]   I pray for anyone tonight who's never trusted in Jesus.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.980]   This would be their night.
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.860]   And the Savior of Esther would be the Savior of them.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:40.680]   Thank you that you made a way, the ultimate God
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:45.200]   who just opens doors and saves his people
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.580]   in spite of themselves.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:50.640]   Would you help us to not forfeit seeing you show up
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.720]   by us choosing to be obedient and walk with you, God.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.560]   We love you.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.920]   We worship you in song, amen.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
