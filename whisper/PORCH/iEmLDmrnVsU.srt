1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 Hey porch, join me as we read God's word together.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,560
 From the Gospel of Luke chapter 8 verses 26 through 39.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,880
 Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,120
 When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,280
 For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,840
 tombs.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,600
 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, "What

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,640
 have you to do with me, Jesus, son of the most high God?

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,840
 I beg you, do not torment me."

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,960
 For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,960
 For many a time it had seized him.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,680
 He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,440
 and be driven by the demon into the desert.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,040
 Jesus then asked him, "What is your name?"

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,460
 And he said, "Legion."

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,480
 For many demons had entered him.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,120
 And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss.

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,040
 Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,640
 them enter these.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,740
 So he gave them permission.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,680
 Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,040
 bank into the lake and drowned.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,940
 When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,660
 Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from

25
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,560
 whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
 they were afraid.

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,600
 And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,780
 Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerizim asked him to depart from them,

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,920
 for they were seized with great fear.

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,360
 So he got into the boat and returned.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,520
 The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,360
 him away, saying, "Return to your home and declare how much God has done for you."

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,240
 And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him."

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,600
 Now our fifth message in our series called "Disciple."

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
 [Applause]

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
 >> PORCH, HOW WE DOIN'?

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
 WE DOIN' OKAY TONIGHT?

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
 [Cheers]

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
 HEY, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YA.

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,960
 THANKS SO MUCH FOR MAKING TIME TO BE BACK WITH US THIS EVENING.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,000
 SPECIAL SHOUT-OUT TO ALL OF OUR PORCH LIVE LOCATIONS.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,880
 LOVE WHAT GOD'S DOING AROUND THE NATION.

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,280
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT, THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE HERE IN DALLAS, BUT THERE'S A

44
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,480
 SPECIAL SHOUT-OUT TO PORCH LIVE SPRINGFIELD, MIDLAND, AND BOISE, IDAHO.

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
 LOVE IT.

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,080
 HEY, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD, BUT ON MARCH 20TH OF THIS YEAR, HISTORY WAS MADE AS CHRIS

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,120
 BROWN IS THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,960
 HE'S THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.

49
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,960
 HE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,960
 HE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:50,200
 HISTORY WAS MADE AS CHRIS BROWN, NOT SEA BREEZY, BUT A MODERN EXPLORER FROM YORKSHIRE,

52
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:58,240
 ENGLAND, JOURNEYED TO ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE PLACES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,160
 HE MADE HIS WAY TO POINT NEMO.

54
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:13,200
 POINT NEMO IS INFAMOUSLY KNOWN AS THE LONELIEST LOCATION ON THE PLANET.

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,640
 BECAUSE POINT NEMO IS FARTHER AWAY FROM ANY SINGLE LANDMASS THAN ANY OTHER SPOT IN THE

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
 ENTIRE GLOBE.

57
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,920
 IT'S LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:31,080
 AND WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT POINT NEMO IS THAT IT IS KNOWN AS THE OCEANIC POINT OF INACCESSIBILITY.

59
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,280
 ANYBODY IS SUPPOSED TO GET THERE.

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,520
 IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO REACH.

61
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,600
 AND THE CLOSEST HUMANS NEARBY TO POINT NEMO ARE NOT IN FACT ON PLANET EARTH.

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,560
 THEY ARE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AS IT FLOATS IN ORBIT ABOVE THE LOCATION.

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,960
 POINT NEMO IS ALSO KNOWN AS AN INTERGALACTIC DUMPING ZONE.

64
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,260
 IT'S WHERE NATIONS WILL DISCARD SPACECRAFT BECAUSE IT IS SO WILDLY REMOTE TO THE REST

65
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,840
 OF CIVILIZATION.

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,040
 AND YET CHRIS BROWN DECIDED TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,800
 GO WHERE NO MAN HAD GONE BEFORE.

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,520
 AFTER FIVE YEARS WORTH OF PLANNING, 21 DAYS OF JOURNEYING, AND STANDING 1600 MILES FROM

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:15,540
 THE NEAREST SHORELINE, HE FOUND HIMSELF NOT JUST IN A BOAT, BUT SWIMMING AT POINT NEMO.

70
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,520
 WHEN ASKED WHY DID YOU DO IT, CHRIS VERY SIMPLY SAID, "I'M AN ADVENTURER AT HEART.

71
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,880
 I GO PLACES NO ONE ELSE WILL."

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680
 WHY DO I TELL YOU THAT?

73
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:36,000
 BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST AND CHRIS BROWN, THE EXPLORER, HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
 EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT JESUS DOESN'T GO PLACES NO ONE ELSE WILL.

75
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,280
 HE MOVES TOWARDS PEOPLE THAT NO ONE ELSE WILL.

76
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,240
 JESUS MOVES TOWARDS THE LONELIEST IN LIFE.

77
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,460
 HE JOURNEYS TO REACH THE MOST INACCESSIBLE IN OUR WORLD.

78
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,840
 HE WANTS TO REACH THE MOST ISOLATED OF ALL.

79
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,240
 AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE SEEKS TONIGHT.

80
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,480
 SO IF YOU HAVE A BIBLE, YOU CAN TURN WITH ME TO LUKE CHAPTER 8.

81
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,040
 LUKE CHAPTER 8.

82
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,680
 JUST TO CATCH YOU UP, WE HAVE BEEN IN A SERIES CALLED DISCIPLE WHERE WE'VE BEEN ASKING THE

83
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,920
 QUESTION WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO REALLY FOLLOW JESUS?

84
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,560
 WHICH FEELS LIKE A PRETTY OBVIOUS QUESTION TO ANSWER.

85
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,520
 MANY OF US, WE WOULD ASSUME THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER TO THAT IS.

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,200
 AND YET, IF WE REALLY GOT UNDERNEATH WHAT WE BELIEVE IT MEANS TO FOLLOW JESUS, WE'D

87
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,280
 PROBABLY FIND SOME THINGS LIKE IT MEANS BEING A GOOD PERSON AND GOING TO CHURCH AND READING

88
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,680
 YOUR BIBLE AND SERVING THE POOR AND GIVING WHEN THE COLLECTION PLATE COMES AROUND AND

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,760
 MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY AND YOU'RE CONFESSING YOUR SIN.

90
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,560
 WE WOULD LIST OFF A BUNCH OF BEHAVIORS.

91
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,400
 AND YET, WHAT THAT WOULD TELL ME IS THAT FOR MANY OF US, WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT JESUS, BUT

92
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
 WE DON'T KNOW THE REAL JESUS.

93
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
 YOU SEE, BECAUSE THESE THINGS, WHILE THEY'RE PART OF THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE, THEY ARE

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,520
 NOT AT THE HEART OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CHRISTIAN.

95
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,680
 BECAUSE AT THE HEART OF BEING A CHRISTIAN IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME LIKE CHRIST.

96
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,640
 LIKE TO HAVE AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD HIMSELF AND TO LIVE A LIFE THAT IS ACTUALLY

97
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,760
 CONNECTED TO SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOU YOURSELF AND TO JOURNEY TO THE END OF YOUR TIME AND

98
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,600
 TO FEEL LIKE MAN, I LIVED FOR A LASTING IMPACT AND TO FIND WITH OTHER PEOPLE A SORT OF FRIENDSHIP

99
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,360
 THAT BECOMES FAMILY BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A DEEP CONNECTION TO THEM THAT THE WORLD KNOWS

100
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,920
 NOTHING ELSE OF IT.

101
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,640
 THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DISCIPLE.

102
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,560
 IT'S TO BECOME LIKE JESUS.

103
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,060
 AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS, WHEN JESUS IS INVITING US TO BE HIS DISCIPLE, HE'S INVITING US INTO

104
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,800
 SOMETHING WE ALREADY WANT.

105
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,640
 LIKE WE ALL WANT THIS.

106
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,060
 THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF FOLLOWING CHRIST.

107
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,480
 LIKE HE WANTS TO DO IN YOUR LIFE WHAT YOU AND I WANT DONE IN OUR LIFE.

108
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
 LIKE WE WANT TO GROW INTO SOMETHING GREATER.

109
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,840
 LIKE WE WANT TO BE SHAPED INTO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT.

110
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
 WE WANT TO BE MOLDED INTO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,040
 AND YET WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT JESUS IS HE'S GOING TO DO THAT IF AND WHEN YOU FOLLOW HIM.

112
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,960
 BUT HE DOESN'T JUST DO IT FOR YOUR GAIN.

113
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,420
 HE DOES IT TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND HE DOES IT FOR THE GOOD OF ALL PEOPLE.

114
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,940
 LIKE THAT'S AN IDENTITY, THAT'S AN ACTIVITY THAT I CAN GET BEHIND, THAT I WANT TO BE CONNECTED

115
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,580
 TO AND THAT'S THE SORT OF LIFE THAT JESUS IS PROMISING US IF WE WOULD CHOOSE TO WALK WITH

116
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,580
 HIM.

117
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,540
 IF WE WOULD ASSOCIATE WITH HIM AS HIS DISCIPLES.

118
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,740
 AND SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING OVER THE COURSE OF THIS SERIES ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A

119
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,740
 DISCIPLE.

120
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,700
 THAT WEEK ONE, TO BE A DISCIPLE MEANS YOU ANSWER HIS CALL.

121
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,220
 THAT YOU DROP YOUR NETS.

122
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
 YOU LEAVE EVERYTHING.

123
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,640
 YOU FOLLOW AFTER HIM.

124
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,220
 NOT JUST BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO COST YOU SO MUCH, BUT BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO OFFER YOU

125
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,500
 SO MUCH.

126
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,500
 IN WEEK TWO, TO BE HIS DISCIPLE, WE LEARNED THAT WE NEED TO HEAR HIS HEART.

127
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,860
 THAT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE HEAVY, THAT THE WEARY AND THE HEAVY LADEN, THEY CAN COME TO

128
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,300
 JESUS BECAUSE HE IS GENTLE AND LOWLY AT HEART.

129
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,060
 IN WEEK THREE, TO BE HIS DISCIPLE, WE LEARNED WHAT IT MEANT TO OBEY HIS WORDS.

130
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,720
 THAT ALL THE LAW AND ALL THE PROPHETS CAN BE SUMMED UP IN THE TWO GREATEST COMMANDMENTS.

131
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,220
 TO LOVE GOD AND TO LOVE HIS PEOPLE.

132
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:14,440
 AND TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT TO BE HIS DISCIPLES, WE SHOULD SEEK HIS PEOPLE.

133
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,720
 WE SHOULD NOT LIKE THE GREAT ADVENTURER CHRIS, BUT THE GREAT SAVIOR JESUS, PURSUE THE LONELIEST

134
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,940
 IN LIFE.

135
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,220
 WE SHOULD MOVE TOWARDS THOSE INACCESSIBLE TO THE WORLD AND ISOLATED MOST OF ALL.

136
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,200
 WE SHOULD PURSUE PEOPLE LIKE WHAT WE FIND IN LUKE CHAPTER 8.

137
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,800
 SO IF YOU HAVE A BIBLE, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT VERSE 26 TOGETHER.

138
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,840
 THIS IS WHAT IT SAID.

139
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
 LUKE 8, 26.

140
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,400
 THEN THEY, TALKING ABOUT JESUS AND HIS DISCIPLES, OKAY?

141
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,760
 THEY SAILED TO THE COUNTRY OF THE GARISENES, WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF GALILEE.

142
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,640
 WHEN JESUS HAD STEPPED OUT ON LAND, THERE MET HIM A MAN FROM THE CITY WHO HAD DEMONS.

143
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,780
 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WORN NO CLOTHES, AND HE HAD NOT LIVED IN A HOUSE, BUT AMONG THE

144
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,780
 TOMBS.

145
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,260
 WHEN HE SAW JESUS, HE CRIED OUT, AND HE FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM, AND HE SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE,

146
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,860
 "WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH ME, JESUS, SON OF THE MOST HIGH GOD?

147
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,540
 I BEG YOU, DO NOT TORMENT ME."

148
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,500
 FOR HE HAD COMMANDED THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT TO COME OUT OF THE MAN.

149
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,220
 FOR MANY A TIME IT HAD SEIZED HIM.

150
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,980
 HE WAS KEPT UNDER GUARD AND BOUND WITH CHAINS AND SHACKLES, BUT HE WOULD BREAK THE BONDS

151
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,840
 AND BE DRIVEN BY THE DEMON INTO THE DESERT."

152
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,980
 So just to set the scene, Jesus and his disciples, they have just journeyed across the Sea of

153
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,860
 Galilee to a land known as the Decapolis.

154
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,260
 And what we didn't read is that they encountered a little bit of trouble along the way.

155
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,460
 There's a storm that arose, and yet with but a word, Jesus silences the storm.

156
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,940
 What we see from Jesus is that he has authority in that story over the natural world.

157
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,140
 And yet as we come to this moment, as they step into the land of the Gerasenes, we find

158
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,300
 that he not only has authority over the natural world, but he has authority over the supernatural

159
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
 world.

160
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,220
 You see, they come to a land known as the Decapolis.

161
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,420
 The Decapolis, without going into too much detail, is Gentile country.

162
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,100
 It wouldn't have been native to Jesus and his disciples.

163
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,220
 It was a pagan land, which meant there were no Jewish festivals, no Torah study, there

164
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,020
 was no observance of the law.

165
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,460
 In fact, it was odd that Jesus and his disciples would even go to this place to begin with.

166
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:28,520
 Like it wasn't widely seen as appropriate for Jews to go to the Decapolis.

167
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,460
 It was frowned upon even.

168
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,940
 And yet Jesus, being Jesus, takes his disciples and they come aboard shore and they step out

169
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,300
 onto the bank.

170
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,580
 And as his disciples look at him wondering, "What are we doing here?"

171
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,020
 Jesus makes clear that he will go to the darkest of places for the darkest of people.

172
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,020
 That's what we learned.

173
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,300
 Jesus goes to the darkest places for the darkest people.

174
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,980
 If we as his disciples, as people that are going to walk with him, if we're going to

175
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,660
 see the kind of people that he sees and seek the sort of people that he seeks, we need

176
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,780
 to know he's going to go to some dark places to find some dark people.

177
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,140
 And the way Luke writes it, he tees the story up like a contest between two really great

178
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,140
 challengers.

179
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,060
 It says, "When Jesus had stepped out onto the land, there met him a man from the city

180
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
 who had demons."

181
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,100
 Like it sounds like the main card from a pay-per-view title fight.

182
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,420
 Like in this corner, out of Nazareth, wearing the white trunks, Jesus, the son of God.

183
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:34,060
 And in this corner, out of the Decapolis, wearing no trunks at all, the crazy man, right?

184
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,660
 That's the way it sets this thing up.

185
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,540
 And yet what you find as you keep reading is before the first punch is even thrown,

186
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,700
 the demon-possessed man just hits the mat.

187
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,660
 He's laid out, and there's good reason for it, but before we can actually unpack why

188
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,940
 that is the case, before we can look at the state of this demon, we have to look at the

189
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,180
 state of the man.

190
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,020
 So what do we learn about the condition of this man?

191
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,500
 Just how dark is his situation?

192
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,340
 Well, we get some descriptors for him.

193
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,660
 It says he has no clothes, that he didn't live among society, he had no home.

194
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,180
 If you go and you read the same account in the Gospel of Mark, you find that night and

195
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,420
 day he would cry out and he would cut himself with stones.

196
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,580
 And in both accounts, you see that he was living amongst the dead.

197
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,180
 He dwelt within the tombs.

198
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,380
 Why does any of that matter?

199
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:30,340
 Because it shows us that the evil this man had indulged, it had dehumanized him.

200
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,580
 Like it made him less human.

201
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,300
 And that's what's important for us to know.

202
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,300
 Just cards on the table here at the very beginning of the night.

203
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,300
 It is imperative that we deal with our evil.

204
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,700
 We reckon with our sin.

205
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:52,580
 We take action on the sort of things that God gives conviction to, lest we be dehumanized

206
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,940
 like this man.

207
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,220
 How is he dehumanized?

208
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,260
 He's dehumanized in three ways.

209
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,920
 He has no dignity.

210
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
 He has no dignity.

211
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,860
 Like he no longer wore clothes.

212
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,780
 That's pretty indignified.

213
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,420
 He has no community.

214
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,180
 He no longer lived amongst the general population, but instead he lived in total isolation.

215
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,340
 And he has no security.

216
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,700
 He doesn't have a home to speak of, but he sleeps amongst the dead in the tombs.

217
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,780
 Now to be clear, we don't know why the demons had entered this man originally.

218
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,940
 We don't know what actions he took.

219
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,340
 We don't know what sort of evil he was entertaining, what sins he had committed.

220
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,600
 All we see are the effects of it.

221
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,220
 That's what it means whenever it says that he was left unclean.

222
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,980
 That word unclean, it's translated as defiled or violated, which I don't know about you,

223
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,620
 but when you read this story and you hear about a demon possessed man, it feels pretty

224
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,620
 unrelatable.

225
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,400
 Like, man, okay, I've done some things, but I'm not quite at this spot.

226
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,420
 This guy seems to have a different level of trauma.

227
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,060
 There's some sort of condition he's facing that I'm not facing myself.

228
00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:01,140
 And yet when you realize that uncleanness means defilement or it means violation or

229
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:07,780
 it's to be stained or tarnished or corrupted, it begins to creep into your reality a little

230
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,220
 bit because those are words that we can relate to.

231
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,260
 I know I can, and maybe you can as well.

232
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:22,540
 We know what it's like to feel defiled, what it feels like to feel corrupted.

233
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:32,460
 You see, for many of us, we got into something that we thought was going to give us life,

234
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,200
 bring us freedom at some point.

235
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,740
 And yet somewhere along the way, whatever that thing is, it actually got hold of us

236
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,740
 and it started to separate us from our family and our friends, started to isolate us from

237
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,620
 the rest of our community.

238
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,300
 It started to lead us to a place.

239
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,700
 We never thought we would actually be.

240
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,940
 It's defiled us.

241
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,660
 Maybe for some of you, it's something that you can't believe you've done.

242
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,220
 Like there's a shadow of shame that hangs over you because of some action you took or

243
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:12,340
 some place you went or something you said that it's just left you feeling like, man,

244
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,840
 this is unforgivable.

245
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,140
 This is unspeakable.

246
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,060
 I will never tell anybody of what I've done.

247
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,900
 This thing that I did, that place that I went, that action that I incurred, that is something

248
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,180
 I'm going to take to the grave.

249
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,380
 I refuse to tell anybody about that.

250
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,080
 And yet you're defiled because you're carrying so much shame for something that you never

251
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,740
 should have to carry.

252
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
 Maybe it's not that.

253
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,620
 Maybe it's an addiction you have, some unhealthy habit that you adopted at some point and it

254
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,460
 was small and it was manageable and it actually felt nice to begin with.

255
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,800
 But at some point it's grown to a place where you really can't corral it.

256
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,020
 You truly can't control it.

257
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,860
 And what it's now done is it's grown to a spot where it's jeopardizing your family and

258
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,420
 your friends and your finances and your future.

259
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,040
 Maybe it's not an addiction.

260
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,300
 Maybe it's the, the shame you feel for an abortion.

261
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:13,260
 Like you found yourself in a situation that you never thought you'd be in.

262
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,980
 Like you never intended to put yourself in a spot that felt so overwhelming and yet when

263
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,880
 those feelings began to grow so great and the anxiety began to cripple so strongly,

264
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,600
 you were forced to make a decision the likes of which you've only felt regret for since

265
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,420
 that time.

266
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,120
 Maybe it's not that.

267
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,620
 Maybe it's some deep seated anger you have towards somebody.

268
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,020
 Maybe it's habitual impurity you have with your boyfriend or your girlfriend.

269
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:48,700
 Maybe instead it's shame from lying at your job, cutting corners, despair from, from,

270
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,620
 from cutting or self harming yourself.

271
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,500
 Maybe it's not something that you've done.

272
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,760
 Maybe it's something that's been done to you.

273
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,420
 Like maybe the defilement you feel in your story, the uncleanness you have in your life

274
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,520
 is the product of what someone has done to you.

275
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,780
 Maybe it's, it's the fact that someone physically hurt you.

276
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,020
 Someone sexually exploited you.

277
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,740
 Someone emotionally manipulated you.

278
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,820
 They did something to you that they should never have done and yet you've been left to

279
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,980
 pick up the pieces and make amends on your own.

280
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,860
 I don't know what it is for you and yet what I do know is that whatever darkness hangs

281
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,780
 over you, whatever leaves you feeling unclean, whatever sin you hide and whatever hate you

282
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,820
 harbor you try to keep out of the public eye, whatever it is that leaves you feeling so

283
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,500
 dirty, Jesus looks at it.

284
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,300
 And he says, I want you anyways.

285
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:50,620
 You see, Jesus is not afraid of the defiled parts of us.

286
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,540
 We know that because Jesus journeyed across the sea for this one man.

287
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,820
 But by the end of the story, we find that he has to leave.

288
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:06,060
 He made the journey as an all sovereign, all knowing God to reach this one guy, totally

289
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,380
 undignified, totally defiled, totally despondent.

290
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,300
 And yet Jesus goes that distance because there's nothing about this man's condition that worries

291
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,840
 our Christ's compassion.

292
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,020
 He would go the greatest distance to be to him because Jesus is not a shepherd of spotless

293
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,780
 sheep.

294
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,620
 He's a shepherd to black sheep.

295
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,300
 He's a shepherd to people like you and me.

296
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:37,020
 Mark 2, 17 says, those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.

297
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,820
 I came not to call the righteous.

298
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,420
 I came to call sinners.

299
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,620
 You see, Jesus welcomes the unacceptable.

300
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,560
 He embraces the unlovable.

301
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,760
 He redeems the unforgivable, like that thing in your life, like the part of yourself that

302
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,140
 feels so dirty, the portion of your story that's too devastating, the piece of your

303
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,220
 existence that feels so dark.

304
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,780
 And Jesus looks at it, he looks past it, and he says, I will take you anyways.

305
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,980
 I want you as you are, not some future version of you, not some cleaned up version of you.

306
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
 I want you exactly as you are.

307
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,460
 Yes, will we work this out?

308
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,460
 For sure.

309
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,060
 Will I lead you to someplace better?

310
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
 Of course.

311
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,260
 And yet I don't need you to lead yourself there.

312
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,020
 I will lead you there myself.

313
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,980
 This is what Jesus is offering for you.

314
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,220
 He doesn't look at the worst parts of you and think, I've got to work around this thing.

315
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,660
 No, he wants everything about you.

316
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,940
 He wants you to come to him because he will fix the worst parts of you and he will love

317
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,780
 every part of you.

318
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,780
 This is what Jesus does.

319
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,340
 He goes to the darkest places for the darkest people.

320
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,780
 He doesn't retreat from the ugly parts of who we are.

321
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,900
 He advances towards them.

322
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,100
 That's the heart of your King.

323
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,180
 And yet we know as we keep reading is that we see before Jesus can help this man, he

324
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,500
 needs to deal with the source of the evil in this man's life.

325
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:03,740
 So he asks him in verse 30, what's your name?

326
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,700
 And the demon possessed man said, Legion for many demons that entered him and they begged

327
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,300
 him not to command them to depart into the abyss.

328
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,700
 Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside and they begged him to let

329
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,740
 them enter these.

330
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,980
 So he gave them permission.

331
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,700
 Then the demons, they came out of the man, they entered the pigs and the herd rushed

332
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,900
 down the steep bank into the lake and they drowned.

333
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
 Okay.

334
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,100
 What's going on here?

335
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:33,860
 Well, this is the only time in any gospel that we see Jesus actually engage in a dialogue

336
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,900
 with a demon, that he actually has a conversation that we see Jesus say one thing, the demons

337
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,620
 say something back and Jesus respond accordingly.

338
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,780
 This is the only example of a dialogue we have between Jesus and a demon.

339
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,260
 And now scholars, they present a variety of different reasons for why this may be.

340
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,580
 Some scholars suggest that Jesus is presenting the ancient near Eastern or Jewish methodology

341
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,140
 for exorcism.

342
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,620
 That burst, you must establish contact.

343
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,300
 The next you must have them share their name.

344
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,020
 And then thirdly, you must cast them out.

345
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,500
 Some people think that this dialogue is an evidence of the formidability of the evil

346
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,060
 in this man, that Jesus can't just cast it out, that instead this demon has something

347
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,740
 he wants to say to Jesus and he has the strength to back it up.

348
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,140
 And yet here's what I would say to those things.

349
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,140
 I think it's so much simpler than that.

350
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:30,900
 Like I think what we see as Jesus asks this demon's name is just how powerful Jesus actually

351
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,400
 is.

352
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,140
 So let me set it up like this.

353
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:41,440
 How does college game day decide where they're going to broadcast every single weekend?

354
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,780
 They pick the best matchup for the weekend.

355
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,980
 Like they pick the two top teams.

356
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,260
 They don't pick two no names.

357
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,060
 They pick two name worthy opponents and they decide that's where we're going to go and

358
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,980
 we're going to highlight this specific matchup.

359
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,860
 Now what happens when one of those teams spanks the other one?

360
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:08,700
 The strength of the team that wins is magnified because they overcame not a no name opponent,

361
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,720
 but a name worthy opponent.

362
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,340
 They're proven to be powerful.

363
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,540
 That's what Jesus is doing.

364
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,040
 He's saying, hey, you actually have a name that we need to hear because it says something

365
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,380
 significant about who you are and yet it's going to say something really significant

366
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,840
 about who I am.

367
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,900
 So what does the name Legion actually represent?

368
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:34,260
 Well, Legion is actually a unit within the Roman army that contained anywhere from 5,000

369
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:40,660
 to 6,000 men, meaning that there's not a square inch of this demon possessed man's life that

370
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,980
 is not disturbed by this supernatural evil.

371
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,220
 But that's not all it means.

372
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,020
 The name Legion, because it is representative of the Roman army, also demonstrates the harshness,

373
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,980
 the brutality of Roman occupation.

374
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,500
 And so there's not a square inch of this man's existence that isn't disturbed and there's

375
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,820
 not a square inch of this man's experience that is not horrible.

376
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,100
 Like that's what the name Legion represents for this guy.

377
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:14,060
 And yet Jesus, he in the face of one that is both great in number and great in strength,

378
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:22,020
 that is powerful by all accounts, he makes him do something you would not expect.

379
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,140
 How do these demons respond?

380
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,740
 They're a great Legion when they come to Jesus.

381
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,380
 They run, they cry, and they fall down.

382
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,380
 That's it.

383
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,940
 Like they behave like spoiled little children that don't get their way.

384
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:43,540
 They get eerily upset because Jesus is so much more dominant, so much more powerful

385
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
 than they are.

386
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,260
 And the reason we need to know it is because whatever intimidates you cowers before your

387
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,340
 king.

388
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,660
 Whatever intimidates you in life, it cowers before your king.

389
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,620
 Doesn't matter how big, doesn't matter how bad, doesn't matter how significant it may

390
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:05,700
 feel in strength, it has no chance against Jesus Christ.

391
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
 Think about it.

392
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:14,200
 Like this guy is possessed by a group of highly militarized demons, a lethal fighting force

393
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,780
 by all accounts.

394
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,420
 And all they can manage to do whenever they face Jesus is grovel and beg.

395
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,420
 That's pretty pathetic.

396
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,420
 And yet that's how powerful Christ is.

397
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,980
 Like this man has been subdued under their authority for years, and yet in a moment,

398
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,580
 they are subdued by Jesus' authority for all time.

399
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,980
 In verse 27, it says that they call Jesus "Son of the Most High God," which is really

400
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
 interesting.

401
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,940
 Like if you read through the Gospel of Luke, and I actually think that this is true in

402
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,700
 the Gospel of Matthew too, what you find is that Jesus is only called the Son of God four

403
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,620
 times.

404
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,980
 Three of those times happen in the life and the ministry of Jesus.

405
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,660
 And what's fascinating is that in the life and ministry of Jesus, when he's called the

406
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:06,860
 Son of God, he is never called that by any single human.

407
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:13,940
 He's called the Son of God by the angel Gabriel whenever Mary is conceived with son.

408
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,460
 He is called the Son of God by Satan whenever he comes to tempt Jesus in the wilderness,

409
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,420
 and he is called the Son of God in this story right here.

410
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,660
 That leaves one other example when Jesus is called the Son of God.

411
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
 And you know what happens?

412
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,620
 It's not in the life and the ministry of Jesus, it's at the arrest, death, and crucifixion

413
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,620
 of Christ.

414
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:36,700
 And it's in that moment, at the point of his mockery and not his ministry, that mankind

415
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,500
 speaks up and calls him the Son of God.

416
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,300
 It's not in reverence, it's in ridicule.

417
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:50,180
 And yet what we know is that while we may have a hard time acknowledging the deity of

418
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,740
 Jesus, angels and demons do not.

419
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,900
 They have no problem acknowledging that he is king.

420
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,020
 James 2, 19 says, "You believe that there is one God.

421
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,620
 Good, even the demons believe that."

422
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,940
 And they shudder.

423
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,180
 You see, these demons, they make no mistake when they see Jesus.

424
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:14,180
 They know who he is and they respond the only appropriate way when they come into the presence

425
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,280
 of royalty.

426
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
 They fall down.

427
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,580
 Like, that's it.

428
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,820
 They bow low in the presence of his royalty, his divinity.

429
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,900
 They do what I knew a lot of college students did whenever I worked in college ministry.

430
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,460
 They would realize that their academic future hung in the balance between whether a teacher

431
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,420
 was going to give them a good grade or a bad grade.

432
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,620
 And so they would grovel and beg before their professors, "Please, God, would you just have

433
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,620
 mercy?"

434
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,460
 And they would hope to God that their professor would actually give them the kind of grade

435
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,940
 they needed.

436
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,020
 They would beg, they would bow.

437
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,580
 They did what these demons themselves do.

438
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,740
 But the possessors of this man's life, they shudder at the sight of Jesus.

439
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:02,980
 And so whatever possesses you, whatever's taken hold of your life, whatever appetites

440
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:11,420
 you feel within your sinful nature, those things shudder at the sight of Christ as well.

441
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,460
 Now I get that some of you hear that and you think to yourself, "But you don't know what

442
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,460
 I've done.

443
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:23,300
 Like you don't understand how long I've been entertaining this thing or how deep down the

444
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,820
 rabbit hole I've gone, how dark the stain actually is.

445
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
 You don't know.

446
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,020
 I've been at this thing for a long time.

447
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,820
 You don't know how far gone I feel.

448
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,020
 Like I understand this may be true for other people when it comes to Jesus, but it's not

449
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,020
 true for me."

450
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,420
 And yet here's the thing that I would tell you, regardless of what your addiction is,

451
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,740
 regardless of whatever your vice is or your lust may be, you're not the exception to this

452
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
 rule.

453
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,780
 Like some of you think you are the exception to this, but you're not.

454
00:27:53,780 --> 00:28:00,260
 Like think about this man, Jesus, he's not negotiating the terms of this man's release

455
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
 from these demons.

456
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,180
 "Hey guys, listen, I know that he's done some bad things.

457
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,300
 I will let you go into those pigs if you let me have him back."

458
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,560
 He's not negotiating the terms of this man's release.

459
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,460
 He is negotiating the terms of their surrender.

460
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,640
 That's who Jesus is.

461
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,180
 That's how strong he is.

462
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,340
 Like they know we don't stand a chance.

463
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,980
 Like Jesus may be outnumbered, but we're the ones that are actually outmatched.

464
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,060
 So it doesn't matter like how long you feel like you've been trapped in sin or how perverse

465
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,100
 it's grown or how often you frequent it or how hopeless you feel.

466
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,900
 Jesus is stronger.

467
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,580
 He's matchless.

468
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,420
 He's uncontested.

469
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,300
 He cannot be overcome.

470
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,060
 He is indomitable.

471
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,060
 That's your Jesus.

472
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:49,620
 Yet here's my fear.

473
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:58,680
 I fear that some of you, you won't see your defilement as deep enough to do something

474
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,900
 about it tonight.

475
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,580
 Like your sin is still concealable.

476
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,740
 Like you can hide whatever it was you looked at because it was private browsing or incognito

477
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,740
 mode.

478
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,860
 You can delete the history.

479
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,260
 Nobody will know.

480
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,780
 Or you justify like it's just sexting.

481
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,780
 It's just foreplay.

482
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,700
 We're not going all the way.

483
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,860
 Or you rationalize the gossip you indulge with friends because this is what they do.

484
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,380
 I don't want to be a part of it, but they're my friends and so I have to engage with it

485
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,020
 so that way I'm not left out or I seem awkward.

486
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,380
 Or you defend something on the grounds of, "Everybody has a little too much to drink."

487
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:47,260
 Or everybody bends the truth every now and then and you make small concessions that will

488
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,060
 lead to great compromise.

489
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,540
 Here's what I would tell you.

490
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:02,340
 You may not seem as outwardly defiled as this man, but you are inwardly defiled all the

491
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,780
 same.

492
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,460
 And hear me on this.

493
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,420
 The end of defilement is always death.

494
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,420
 That's what the pigs are about.

495
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,140
 I don't know if you've been wondering, "Man, it's kind of a weird swerve in the story,

496
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,700
 a strange development that we've got these pigs that these demons want to go into.

497
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,740
 What's the whole purpose?

498
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,060
 Why does Jesus allow it?"

499
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,860
 There's a lot of different speculation as to why it may be, but here is the simple and

500
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
 short of it.

501
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,260
 It shows us what the ultimate ambition of evil is.

502
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,700
 The ultimate ambition of evil is the destruction of life.

503
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,860
 That's its ambition.

504
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,860
 That's its aim.

505
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,420
 It does not want you to succeed.

506
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,020
 It wants you to fail.

507
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,420
 It wants you to fall.

508
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,420
 That's what the enemy is trying to do.

509
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,660
 And that's why I am pleading with you to do something about it tonight, to come to Jesus

510
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,980
 with it tonight.

511
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,260
 I can't want it for you any more than I do right now.

512
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:08,180
 And the reason I want it so badly for you is I know what the results are.

513
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,180
 That's what we see as we keep reading on.

514
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,740
 We see in verses 34 through 35, "When the herdsmen saw what had happened, that the pigs

515
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,740
 had drowned, they fled and they told it in the city and in the country.

516
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,420
 Then the people went out to see what had happened and they came to Jesus and guess what they

517
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,420
 found?

518
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,940
 Was it a naked man?

519
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,460
 Was it a crazy man?

520
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,340
 Was it a man that still lived within the tombs that was bleeding and frosting at the mouth?

521
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:36,420
 No, they found the man from whom the demons had gone and he was sitting at the feet of

522
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,420
 Jesus.

523
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,860
 He was clothed and he was in his right mind and they were afraid.

524
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,160
 Now they're the ones that are afraid.

525
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,340
 Like just think about the before and after shots of this guy.

526
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:51,700
 Like before this man had many demons, after no demons whatsoever.

527
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,620
 Before he had no clothes, after praise God he got clothes somehow.

528
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:03,180
 Before he fell down before Jesus and he shouted and yet now after he is sitting at the feet

529
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,420
 of Jesus and he is in his right mind, he's listening.

530
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,940
 What could your before and after look like?

531
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:19,580
 Like before I was addicted to porn, but after I'm porn free.

532
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:25,620
 Before I was insecure, I was codependent on other people to meet my emotional needs and

533
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:32,700
 yet now I'm totally secure because I'm connected to Christ.

534
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,340
 Before I was afraid that no one would ever remember me and yet now after the fact I know

535
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,340
 that God will never forget me.

536
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:49,980
 Before I lived for the acceptance of people and yet after I know that Christ died to prove

537
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,460
 just how much he wanted me.

538
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,800
 What could your before and after look like?

539
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,380
 Because Jesus wants to do it and he wants to do it tonight.

540
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,740
 I really believe it.

541
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,740
 This is how he works.

542
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:09,620
 Like he doesn't just remove the chaos from your life, he introduces order to your life.

543
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,940
 That's the nature of peace.

544
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:16,580
 Peace is not just the absence of conflict, it is the presence of flourishing.

545
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,940
 Like if this man's life was a garden, Jesus the gardener, he would come in and he would

546
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,660
 remove all the stones and all the debris and pull all the weeds, but he wouldn't just leave

547
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,740
 it like that because he wants to bring peace.

548
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,140
 He would plant something beautiful in its place.

549
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:38,220
 He wouldn't just pull out what was wrong, he would put in what is right.

550
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:42,580
 He would plant life.

551
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:47,700
 And the beauty of it is it takes this man from being defiled to dignified.

552
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,100
 It's a radical transformation.

553
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,420
 It's so radical in fact that it leaves the people freaking out.

554
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,820
 Like they're the ones that are afraid now.

555
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,260
 They're the ones that cannot comprehend how in fact he went from where he was to where

556
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,740
 he in fact now is.

557
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,140
 Like what if God wants to do something in your life that would freak the people out

558
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
 around you?

559
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,220
 Like if he wanted to move you from where you are to where he in fact wants you to be, if

560
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:13,860
 he took away the evil in your world and he put in its place something so beautiful and

561
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,340
 right.

562
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,620
 We know from this story that that is his heart, that that's what he wants to do.

563
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:27,300
 It says in 37, "All the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes, they asked him,"

564
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,180
 talking about Jesus, "to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear.

565
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,580
 So he got into the boat and he returned.

566
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,940
 The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with them.

567
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,340
 But Jesus sent him away saying, 'Return to your home and declare how much God has done

568
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,340
 for you.'

569
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:54,660
 And he went away and he proclaimed throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for

570
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,660
 him."

571
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:03,300
 Like Jesus gives dignity and he gives destiny like you wouldn't believe.

572
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,140
 Jesus gives dignity and he gives destiny like you wouldn't believe.

573
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:13,940
 Like Jesus did not just rescue this man from unbelievable problems.

574
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:19,420
 He rescued him to an unbelievable purpose.

575
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,020
 He gives it like you wouldn't believe.

576
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,500
 It would blow your mind to see what he would do in the life of someone, to see what he

577
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,580
 might do in the life of you if you would just take a chance on him.

578
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,500
 What was this man's purpose?

579
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,260
 Well this guy can't see it yet.

580
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:43,100
 But what we know is that Jesus, he leaves the Decapolis because these people are afraid

581
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
 of him.

582
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,140
 They ask him, they beg him to leave and he concedes.

583
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,180
 He pulls away.

584
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:56,620
 And yet Jesus' purpose for this man is to be the very first missionary that Jesus ever

585
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,620
 sends out.

586
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:04,060
 And what we find is that he does it.

587
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:09,660
 He steps into an obedient posture and as Jesus comes back to the Decapolis only one other

588
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,660
 time in his life.

589
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,600
 What he finds is a very different reception waiting for him on shore.

590
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,360
 At the end of this story, these people want him to leave and yet when Jesus finally comes

591
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:27,640
 back around what he finds are 4,000 people that can't wait to learn from him.

592
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,040
 They can't wait to get near to him.

593
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,880
 Where do they come from?

594
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,920
 This one man.

595
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:45,440
 They heard the story about a savior that gives dignity to the undignified, that gives destiny

596
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,760
 to the damned.

597
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,880
 And they knew, "I need that too."

598
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,080
 And so they came close.

599
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,520
 Paul says it like this in 2 Corinthians, "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for

600
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,120
 you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.

601
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,240
 Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of Christ

602
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,580
 may rest upon me.'"

603
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:19,260
 This demon possessed man, he was willing to boast his weakness and the results are astounding.

604
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:26,300
 He embraced the weakness of his story because it expressed the greatness of his God.

605
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,700
 So last story.

606
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,660
 A couple years ago, Brooke and I were flying to Nashville when a flight attendant hopped

607
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,860
 on the intercom and made a very common announcement.

608
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,980
 Attention passengers, it seems that we're going to be encountering a little bit of turbulence

609
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,060
 here in just a few short moments.

610
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,180
 If you would please return to your seats, fasten your seat belts.

611
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,880
 Thank you very much.

612
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,580
 Nothing alarming in the slightest.

613
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,580
 Made total sense.

614
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,060
 I'd heard this announcement before.

615
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,240
 It was commonplace.

616
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,300
 That is until the flight attendant came back on the intercom.

617
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:10,180
 And attention passengers, it does look like we will be experiencing some turbulence and

618
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,380
 it will be quite a bit of turbulence.

619
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:19,020
 Yet we want to encourage our white knuckle flyers, do not fear, though it may grow bad

620
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:24,020
 outside, you can rest assured.

621
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:29,860
 You're completely safe within the comfort of this plane.

622
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:34,780
 I remember I'm not one that gets anxious on planes.

623
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:40,940
 Yet it was in hearing that message that I began to grow somewhat anxious because I knew

624
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,980
 that we weren't just going to be encountering some trouble.

625
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,500
 We're going to be encountering quite a bit of trouble.

626
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,340
 We weren't just going to be driving or flying into the dark.

627
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:54,260
 We were going to be flying into quite a bit of darkness and it left me anxious.

628
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,700
 I felt nervous.

629
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,940
 And as we flew forward and I looked out the window seat, for whatever reason, I decided

630
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:10,460
 to sit in the window seat this one time, I could see the sky beginning to get dark, the

631
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:17,300
 clouds beginning to roll, the rain beginning to fall, and the lightning striking in the

632
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
 distance.

633
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,260
 And as it did, the whole plane began to shake.

634
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,900
 Everything began to shudder.

635
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,580
 And I could feel all of that anxiety boiling up to a breaking point within me.

636
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:36,060
 It left me to a spot where I felt so much terror in light of the trouble.

637
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:41,460
 And then I remembered the words of the flight attendant.

638
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:51,140
 It may grow dark, but rest assured, the plane can handle much more than you think.

639
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,300
 You're completely safe.

640
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,740
 You're totally comfortable.

641
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,500
 I don't know how bumpy life has gotten for you.

642
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,700
 I don't know how much turbulence you feel like you've encountered.

643
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:10,180
 I don't know how dark the sky seems to have grown and what sort of feelings have risen

644
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,180
 up from within.

645
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:19,540
 But what I know is that with Jesus, you're completely safe.

646
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,300
 You're totally safe.

647
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:30,260
 Because we have a Savior that He goes to the darkest places for the darkest people.

648
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,500
 This is what He did for us.

649
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,900
 We all at one time, we were dark in the understanding of our minds.

650
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,580
 We were enemies of God.

651
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:45,420
 And yet Jesus, He raced into the darkness of our existence to get close to us.

652
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:52,760
 He came to liberate a dark people, to make them sons and daughters, children of light.

653
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:59,620
 We know that Jesus, He is the King whom our enemy cowers before.

654
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,820
 He proved it in the fact that He came into this life, living the way that none of us

655
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,220
 could, living perfectly on our behalf.

656
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,640
 And yet He died the death all of us deserved.

657
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,820
 He hung Himself in our place and He absorbed all the shame and all the scrutiny and all

658
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,980
 of the punishment that was deserving us in our sin.

659
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:29,820
 And as He endured it on our behalf, He proved through the words, "It is finished."

660
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,740
 That we have nothing to be intimidated by.

661
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:39,940
 But our enemy is the one who will cower before Him, before our King who is upon His cross.

662
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,380
 And we know that we have a Savior who gives destiny and He gives dignity like you wouldn't

663
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,380
 believe.

664
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:54,380
 It would blow your mind because He has given you the dignity of belonging to His family,

665
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:05,620
 of being a co-heir with Him in the destiny of living with Him forevermore.

666
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,180
 I don't know what evil you face.

667
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,460
 I don't know how insidious your sin may be.

668
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,740
 But what I do know is it doesn't matter how far you've fallen, the darkness that hovers

669
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:23,860
 overhead, none are too hopeless, none are too lost.

670
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:28,100
 Jesus has given everything to prove that this is true.

671
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:35,100
 The question is, like this man, will you run and will you fall before Him tonight?

672
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,500
 Let me pray for us.

673
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:50,660
 God, this moment now is a moment you and I have talked a lot about.

674
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:58,860
 And so God, I'm praying for your guidance and your leadership here.

675
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,460
 But Lord, I don't want this to just be some lesson we've learned.

676
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:09,620
 I want this to be a lesson that we live, God.

677
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:17,820
 I don't just want for us to become more intellectually acquainted with truth.

678
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:27,140
 I want us to be more intimately acquainted with you.

679
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,860
 So help me now, God.

680
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:41,940
 Hey, Porch, would you look up at me for a minute?

681
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:52,140
 We often see when we look at the Scriptures that Jesus responds to the faith He sees.

682
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,660
 We see it over and over and over and over again throughout the Bible.

683
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:07,160
 And yet what we know in this moment is that this man's reality, it was wracked by a sort

684
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,080
 of evil the likes of which he should never have engaged.

685
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,300
 And everything about him looks like it's control possessed in this moment.

686
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:23,520
 And yet what we know is that this man does something likely upon his own volition.

687
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,820
 These demons, they had no reason to run to Jesus because they knew they were whipped.

688
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:35,820
 They had no reason to come to Jesus because they knew that would be the end of their story.

689
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,740
 So how then did this man get to the feet of Jesus?

690
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:50,100
 I think in faith, even the most microcosmic of faith he had, he ran.

691
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:57,300
 Some of you here tonight, you need to run to the feet of Jesus.

692
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,780
 And that's all you got to do.

693
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:06,380
 We see this man, he runs and he falls and Jesus, he takes care of the rest.

694
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,020
 Some of you need to let his story be your story.

695
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,980
 And you need to let it happen tonight.

696
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,940
 Not because I'm wanting to fabricate something here.

697
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:23,820
 Not because we're trying to create some moment that we can look back on or tell stories of.

698
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,380
 I think you need to do it because Christ has brought you here for that reason.

699
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,940
 And so I don't know what the darkness is in your life.

700
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,300
 I don't know what the shadow of shame looks like in your story.

701
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,260
 And yet we're going to respond and we're going to sing.

702
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:48,780
 But before we do, I want to invite those of you that feel like this is your story and

703
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,620
 you're at a breaking point where you want things to change.

704
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:55,420
 I want to invite you to come down here so that I can pray over you.

705
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,500
 But before you do, there's also a second call to the room.

706
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,420
 Because I think there are many of us here that are like, man, no, Jesus has liberated

707
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,480
 me from that.

708
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,580
 He has delivered me from my darkness.

709
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,460
 I live in the light now.

710
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:14,980
 And yet what we know as his disciples, as we seek his people, that none is too far gone.

711
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,260
 None is too hopeless.

712
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:23,340
 And so maybe if you're here and you know of someone that you've deemed too far gone, you've

713
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:28,420
 found to be hopeless in their story, that you don't know if there is room for God to

714
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,420
 move.

715
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,100
 Maybe tonight is a night for you to stand in the gap on their behalf.

716
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,740
 It's to intercede in their stead.

717
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,180
 It's to come down here so that way we can pray for them.

718
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:44,660
 And you can be the kind of disciple that Jesus himself has shown us to be.

719
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:50,620
 That we would go any distance to reach the isolated, to engage the inaccessible, to save

720
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,620
 the sinner.

721
00:46:51,620 --> 00:47:00,260
 And so if you're here tonight and you want to lay the darkness down and you want to leave

722
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:04,340
 it here forevermore and you want to walk out into the light of what God has for you, I

723
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,860
 want to invite you to come forward.

724
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,820
 And if you're here and you want to stand in the gap for someone else, you want to hold

725
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:16,820
 the ground for someone else, you feel like God has called you to be the friend that leads

726
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,740
 someone to the cross of Christ, or you believe that God's going to move in someone's story,

727
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:26,740
 but you want to stand as a faithful disciple in their place tonight, I want to ask you

728
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,740
 to come down too.

729
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,420
 This is a bold thing.

730
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:34,780
 And I've been on the fence about doing this, but this isn't just about being the weekly

731
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,460
 entertainment for you.

732
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,780
 This is about actually doing the real work.

733
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,420
 And so if that's you, would you be willing to come down here in this moment?

734
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:50,340
 Would you be willing to get up and come down to the front so that we can pray for you,

735
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,900
 pray with you, for your friend?

736
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,820
 Would you be willing?

737
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,540
 Would you take a step of faith?

738
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,780
 Would you show Jesus?

739
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,180
 I don't just know the right things.

740
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,140
 I will live the right things.

741
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,580
 I will do the right things.

742
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:09,140
 I will make a move for my Savior and for my King.

743
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,140
 Some of you are coming down.

744
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,140
 You come down.

745
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,820
 Please, yeah, make your way.

746
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,860
 None's too far gone.

747
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:22,340
 None is too hopeless for this moment.

748
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,100
 Some of you, you may be with a friend here tonight.

749
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,100
 You'll come down.

750
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,320
 Yeah, come on.

751
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,540
 Some of you may have a friend here tonight that's told you, "Hey, I feel like I'm a lost

752
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,540
 cause.

753
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,060
 I feel like a total outcast.

754
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,140
 I feel like I've been abandoned by God."

755
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,580
 Maybe you need to be the one to grab him by the hand and say, "We're going to come down

756
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,580
 here together.

757
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,580
 And we're going to pray.

758
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:45,540
 And we're going to ask God to move.

759
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,700
 We're going to believe that Jesus can do in your life what he has done in so many other

760
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,700
 people's lives."

761
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,240
 Y'all come down.

762
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,240
 You make space.

763
00:48:53,240 --> 00:49:03,520
 Yeah, keep coming.

764
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,520
 It's not too late.

765
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,360
 Some of you are sitting here and you're thinking, "Man, I don't want to be exposed.

766
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,360
 I don't want to be outed.

767
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,360
 I don't want to be seen.

768
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,360
 I don't want to..."

769
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,160
 Listen, you're in good company tonight.

770
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,160
 Look at these friends.

771
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,200
 Look at these brothers and sisters.

772
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,440
 These people that want to take a stand.

773
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,880
 That want to make a move.

774
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,220
 That want to live into the kind of life that God has invited us to be a part of.

775
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,600
 This is a chance to move and to be a part of it.

776
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,600
 I'm going to pray.

777
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,920
 And what I would ask is, if you're with someone, you know, lay a hand on them.

778
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:42,860
 And if you're in the room, would you extend a hand to the front of the stage to where

779
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,440
 these friends now are?

780
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,440
 And let me pray.

781
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,840
 God, I know my story.

782
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,640
 I know how dark my days were before you.

783
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:13,200
 But I know, Jesus, it was upon meeting you, it was when you found me that everything changed.

784
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,840
 I know, God, that there's some people here tonight that are kneeling here before you,

785
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,960
 that are sitting here before you.

786
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,600
 And they've done so because it's a testament to the fact that, God, they don't want the

787
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,860
 life they've been living any longer.

788
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,340
 They don't want to entertain the addiction any longer.

789
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,640
 They don't want to sit in the shame any longer, God.

790
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,440
 They don't want to feel the shadow of their sin any longer, God.

791
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,840
 They don't want to feel the separation from you any longer, God.

792
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,840
 They found themselves in a place that they were never supposed to be in, God.

793
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,320
 And yet, now they're here and they're saying, "No, God, I don't want this anymore.

794
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,320
 I want you, God.

795
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,960
 This is a testament to my faith.

796
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,160
 This is a demonstration of my belief in Jesus."

797
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,480
 You move towards those that move towards you.

798
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,120
 Your word says you draw close to those that draw close to you.

799
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,360
 And, God, they have come close tonight that you might come close to them.

800
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:19,680
 I pray, our Defender, lift the darkness, remove the veil.

801
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:26,600
 Free us, God, from our shame and let the flood of your forgiveness wash over us in a way

802
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:32,840
 that leads us to be eternally different, totally changed.

803
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,600
 You can do it, God.

804
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,920
 You move towards the darkest of places for the darkest of people.

805
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,480
 Some of us are down here, God, and we've not come for ourselves.

806
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,800
 We have come for someone else.

807
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:51,560
 We have a friend, a sibling, a parent, a coworker, a neighbor that is lost in something that,

808
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,400
 God, we are praying you would deliver them out of.

809
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:02,640
 And so, God, we're asking you to see the cries of your people here, to answer, God, our intercession

810
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:11,840
 and to liberate, God, the lives of our friends, of our family who seem too far gone, who seem

811
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:19,840
 totally isolated, who seem so very inaccessible, God, none is so inaccessible that you can't

812
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,000
 reach them.

813
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,920
 Your hand is not too short.

814
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,920
 Your grace is never run dry.

815
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:34,840
 So, God, we believe that tonight things can't change.

816
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,000
 We really do.

817
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,160
 I know, God, I feel trepidation in my spirit as I pray that, God, man, it could change

818
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,600
 right now, that, man, I don't know, maybe tomorrow is going to be hard.

819
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,200
 And God, that could be the case.

820
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,920
 And yet what I know is you can do whatever you want.

821
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,640
 Addiction can fall.

822
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,600
 Shame can fall.

823
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,920
 Sickness can fall.

824
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:04,240
 God, anything can be undone by the one that has undone the grave on our behalf.

825
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:09,080
 And so, God, we're begging you, come, work, move in this space.

826
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,400
 We love you, Lord.

827
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:17,480
 We're grateful, God, that you're a good Savior and you would reach even the most unreachable

828
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,160
 of people, people like us.

829
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,160
 It's in Christ's name we pray.

830
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,160
 Amen.

831
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,160
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
