[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [phone ringing]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.500]   [phone dialing]
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.000]   You have 7 unheard messages.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Hey, sorry I haven't texted.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.500]   Hey yo Danny!
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500]   Where you at bro?
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.000]   I'll see you soon alright?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Hey, so I have moved on
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500]   but I feel like the lorry keeps putting you back on my heart for a reason.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500]   So please call me back.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000]   Hey bro, hey I know you're going through it right now
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   but listen, I found another girl at the farmers market now.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.500]   She's not a farmer but she is on the market.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.500]   Okay, so hit me back. Love you bro.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000]   No, I'm sure this is the right number
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.500]   but last night was a mistake.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.000]   I was just hoping we could keep that between us.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.500]   Hey, just wanted to say I don't think I can make it tonight.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000]   Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500]   and we need to talk.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500]   [phone ringing]
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500]   Alright Porsche, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500]   We doing okay?
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.500]   It's great to see you.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.500]   Thanks so much for making time to be here with us this evening.
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.500]   We never take it for granted.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.500]   We consider it such an honor to be a part of what God is doing
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.500]   here in the city of Dallas, in the lives of our generation.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500]   Seeing it week in and week out, it's really amazing.
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.000]   But then also getting to be a part of what God is doing
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   in the lives of young adults just like yourself
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   in cities all over the nation.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500]   We've got Porsche Live locations that are near and dear to our heart
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.000]   where people, just like you, are gathering together
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.500]   and they're worshiping in song and they're reading God's word.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.000]   And so we're so glad.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Like if you're a Porsche Live location, thanks for tuning in
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and a special shout out to Porsche Live Springfield, Midland and Boise.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Well, there came a moment two years into my relationship with Brooke
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   that I never foresaw coming and I have never forgotten since.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.500]   And the reason why is because she wrote me six painstaking pages
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.000]   detailing some troubles that we were navigating at that time
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   in our dating relationship.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.500]   Now, I'm not going to read you most of this.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.000]   In fact, I'm not going to read you much of it.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.500]   But I am going to read you the very first sentence
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.000]   because I think it will help articulate to you
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.500]   why this was such a defining moment for the two of us.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   It reads this.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   "Kylin, I'm so sorry if this comes to you as a surprise
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.500]   or if it is too harsh, but I have some painfully honest feelings
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   that after much thought and prayer, I know I need to communicate."
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   How do you think the rest of this letter reads?
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   Tough. It is tough to work through.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.000]   I haven't looked at this thing in years.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.500]   I didn't know that I still had it.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   And yet I decided to crack it open, read through its pages,
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.000]   and I decided one sentence was enough to get the ball rolling on this
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   because what you need to know is it articulates a moment in our relationship
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   that was difficult to say the least,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.500]   a moment that we were facing a question so many of you
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   either have faced or potentially are facing right now,
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   which is, are we even supposed to be together?
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   And listen, at that time, Brooke and I, we were dating purely
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.000]   and we were talking honestly and laughing regularly
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   and loved one another genuinely.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.500]   We were in a really healthy spot.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   And yet what we found is as we journeyed through our romantic relationship
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.000]   with one another, we started to identify some differences,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.500]   some distinctions in one another that began to create some discrepancies.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.000]   We started to see like, man, okay, our futures, are they actually aligned?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You've got these gifts and I've got these gifts.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.500]   There's some personality distinctions between us
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   and that's creating some difficulty.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.500]   Or maybe it's not that, maybe it's a weakness you have
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   or a skill you didn't learn or it's a challenge in our upbringing.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   As we started to see these things stacked up in comparison to one another,
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.000]   it begged the question within our relationship,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.500]   is this thing meant to go the distance
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   or is this as far as we actually should go?
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.000]   Now, why do I tell you that?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Because although Brooke and I, we stand here today
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and we are more happily married in this moment than we have ever been,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   it's nonetheless true that for you, you're going to find yourself,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.500]   despite dreams of fairy tales and anticipating happily ever afters,
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   facing a similar situation.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   You're going to see in your life, whether it's now or it's later,
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   you're going to encounter the pain of love gone wrong.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   Love is difficult. Romance is challenging.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   Maybe it's from constant communication breakdowns
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   between you and your significant other that's left you just feeling like,
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.000]   man, we're on different pages. We can never seem to get aligned.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.500]   Maybe it's not that. Maybe it's the fact that they always overpromise,
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.000]   but they under deliver. They're full of good intentions,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   but they never actually follow through with action.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And maybe it's not that.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Maybe you've just tangoed through trouble one too many times
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.500]   and you're emotionally exhausted and you're just not sure
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.000]   if you have the gas to keep going, no matter what it is, whatever it is.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.500]   It is more than likely in our generation been memorialized in your mind
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   by way of romantic regret or some unwanted wound
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   or an angsty teenage breakup song.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   It's no surprise, in fact, that people like Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.000]   and Selena Gomez and Adele and Olivia Rodrigo all have breakups
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.500]   to thank for their first number one hit on the Billboard Top 100.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.500]   Why? Because there's something that we resonate with when we hear those lyrics.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.000]   You did set fire to the rain.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.500]   You do remember it all too well.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500]   They did say forever.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.000]   And now you're alone driving past their street.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You see, heartbreak hits hard, people.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And I don't just mean that figuratively.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.500]   It's fascinating.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   When studied under an MRI scanner,
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.000]   the brain of a person experiencing heartbreak
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.500]   resembles the brain of someone experiencing cocaine withdrawals.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   Because you're literally detoxing yourself from that other person.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   Like, you've become hooked on them.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.000]   That's the nature of what happens as you express affection
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.500]   and you share intimacy and you commemorate particular moments and experiences.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.000]   You find that a breakup is not just an emotional test.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It is a physical test as well.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.500]   And the world has a variety of prescriptions
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.500]   to help you figure out your way through it.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   But God has another way.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.000]   He has a way that I want to walk through with you tonight
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.500]   that might be able to help ease some of the difficulty
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   if you're considering breaking up.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.000]   I want to talk to you about how to do that,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.500]   which I know some of you are like,
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.000]   "Why did we come to the porch tonight?"
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   if this is what he's going to talk about.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Here's the truth.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   We're going to talk about it because the goal in understanding how to break up
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   isn't just to minimize pain.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's to maximize life.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.500]   That's what God's intent has always been when it comes to relationships.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.000]   You see, although the Bible doesn't give us a detailed blueprint
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.500]   on how to break up with someone,
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.500]   it does give us a lot of detail on how to treat someone.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   And so what I want to do over the course of the rest of our time
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.500]   is I just want to look through a variety of passages
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.500]   to substantiate three particular principles
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   that I think will be helpful for you
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.500]   as you navigate the difficult terrain of love gone wrong.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.000]   So you can track with the screen.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It's going to be difficult to pick up all the verses just by flipping along.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.500]   But before we even dive into it, here's what I want to say.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.000]   This is now our eighth week in this series,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.500]   which I don't know how that leaves you feeling.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.000]   I know for me, it has felt like a really long journey.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And yet it can feel that way if all we see this series as
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.500]   is a self-help guide to finding love.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.000]   But that's not just what this is.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Yes, there are some principles that we're going to discuss.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   But what you realize as you study these principles from God's word
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   is they're not just principles to finding love.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   They're a picture of love found you.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   We see in Jesus, not just the lessons on how to engage with another person romantically.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   We see in Jesus a picture of what that love should look like actually.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Like we see in him, in the gospel itself,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   something bigger and richer and deeper and fuller and realer
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.500]   than you can find in the world.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.000]   And so as we get into this tonight, what I want you to do is
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I want you to see everything we talk about as it connects to him.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   If all you do is walk away and you feel like you learned some tricks
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.500]   and some hacks on how to find the one, then we've missed it tonight.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   You've got to make sure to see the only one that actually matters.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.500]   So with all that said, how do you break up?
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.500]   Well, the first way you break up is you speak clearly so questions are answered.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.500]   You speak clearly so questions are answered.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.500]   As God's people, let me be very clear.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.500]   We do not deal in delusions.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.500]   We deal in the truth. That's the nature of who we are.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.500]   And it's particularly true when it comes to breakups.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.500]   So Ephesians 4.15 tells us,
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.500]   "Rather, speaking the truth in love, we're to grow up in every way
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.500]   into him who is the head and to Christ."
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.500]   Colossians 3.9 says, "Do not lie to one another."
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.500]   You're not a person of delusion.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.500]   "See instead that you've put off the old self with its practices."
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   1 Peter 3.10, "Whoever desires to love life and see good days."
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.500]   Does that sound like anybody? That sounds like me.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   "Let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit."
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.500]   Let him turn away from evil and do good instead.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.500]   Let him seek peace and pursue it.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.500]   What does all of that mean?
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.500]   It means that as we walk through life,
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   and particularly as we walk through dating,
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.500]   we're not just meant to live, we're specifically meant to speak
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.500]   in such a way that avoids confusion by pursuing clarity.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.500]   That's what this is all saying.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.500]   Which is why ghosting is such a terrible tactic for ending a relationship.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.500]   If it weren't, then 84% of millennials and Gen Z,
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.500]   aka people like you, wouldn't admit to being ghosted
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.500]   and not feeling very good about it.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:37.500]   Ghosting, aka the act of falling off the face of the planet,
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.500]   ultimately breeds confusion. That's what it does.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.500]   You see, it doesn't help people get the hint.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.500]   It just helps people get hurt.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.500]   That's all that ghosting does.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.500]   And I know, I don't need to convince you that ghosting is bad.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.500]   Like we've all been there, we all get that.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.500]   But I do need to convince you to stop doing it to one another.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.500]   You see, the truth of the matter is,
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.500]   so many of us don't want the awkward interaction
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.500]   of looking at someone and saying,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   "I just don't think that this is working for me."
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.500]   And so, I guess if I don't have anything nice to say,
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   I shouldn't say anything at all.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.500]   But listen, you don't thank someone for not pointing out to you
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   the fact that you have food in your teeth.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.500]   You don't thank someone for failing to inform you that your fly is open.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.500]   Why? Because clarity is kindness, not silence.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   You don't want to be silent because that is not kind.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.500]   So listen, when it comes to this reality,
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.500]   ghosting other people because, man,
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.500]   it's just easier to avoid the difficulty than actually engage it.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:40.500]   I want to be clear, that is so dehumanizing to another person.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.500]   It's dehumanizing to look at someone and say,
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.500]   "Man, you're worthy of my words at the beginning of our relationship,
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.500]   but you're not worthy of my words at the end of it."
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   That literally dehumanizes someone.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.500]   It ascribes to them value,
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.500]   and then it reassigns value elsewhere,
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.500]   particularly to yourself at the end of the relationship.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:05.500]   If you have the audacity to take from someone else their time
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.500]   at the beginning of your relationship,
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.500]   then have the decency to give of your time to them
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.500]   at the end of the relationship.
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.500]   Don't ghost one another.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.500]   We speak the truth in love,
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.500]   which is an important clarification to be very clear,
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.500]   because while love certainly means we do say something,
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.500]   it doesn't mean that we say everything.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.500]   Colossians 4, 6 says,
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.500]   "Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt."
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.500]   Why?
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.500]   "So that you may know how you ought to answer each person."
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:43.500]   Meaning, we should be considerate of what's constructive in the breakup.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.500]   I remember counseling a guy when I worked in college ministry.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.500]   He came to me and he was talking to me about a breakup
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.500]   that he'd recently lived through.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.500]   It was interesting hearing him recount the facts,
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.500]   because he didn't come to me and tell me,
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.500]   "Man, these are all the things that she said I did well,"
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.500]   or, "You know what, these are all the things that I didn't do well."
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.500]   He wasn't remembering any of the details about their interactions.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   What he remembered instead was the fact that she looked at him
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.500]   in the midst of the breakup and simply said,
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:14.500]   "I just wish you were taller."
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.500]   Now, there's a lot that I could say about this,
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   but for the sake of time.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.500]   With your words, you have the ability to do one of two things.
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.500]   You have the ability to be constructive to someone else,
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.500]   to build them up, or destructive to someone else,
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.500]   which is tear them down.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.500]   In a dating relationship, everything you say,
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.500]   particularly when you break up, needs to be constructive.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.500]   It needs to exist to build the other person up.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.500]   Am I saying that you can't have preferences in dating?
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.500]   No, I'm not saying that.
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.500]   Am I saying that you shouldn't consider those preferences
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.500]   as you move through a dating relationship?
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.500]   Of course not.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.500]   You need to think about those things.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500]   You need to evaluate a future with that person.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.500]   But what I am saying is if they don't have control over it,
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.500]   you don't get to blame them for it.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:06.500]   You see, the goal in a breakup is to speak with such consideration
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.500]   and construction that the other person understands what's wrong with us
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   and not what's wrong with me.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.500]   Does that make sense?
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.500]   You want them to understand why we're not a good fit for each other
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:25.500]   as opposed to why you're not a good fit for me.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.500]   It's a collective issue.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.500]   It's two people processing why there's a misfire.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.500]   Of course, there are always exceptions to this rule.
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.500]   If he speaks and he's constantly tearing you down,
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.500]   he's rude, he's anxious, he's perpetually a problem with the words he says,
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.500]   maybe it's good to say that.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.500]   Hey, when you say things, it's rude, man.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.500]   You shouldn't speak that way.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.500]   Maybe she's always pushing physical boundaries,
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.500]   and that's just inappropriate.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.500]   Sometimes that stuff needs to be said.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.500]   But let me be clear.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.500]   What you want to do is you want to speak on things
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.500]   that are ultimately for their benefit,
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.500]   which means there are things like physical appearance,
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:10.500]   and personality type, chronic illness, career accolades,
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.500]   family of origin, ethnic differences, all of these things,
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.500]   they are off limits when it comes to breaking up with someone.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.500]   Let me be very clear.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.500]   I'm not saying they shouldn't be considered
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.500]   as you evaluate your future with one another.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.500]   I have spoken to both guys and girls
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.500]   that have considered the weighty reality
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.500]   of entering into a long-term relationship,
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.500]   covenanting in marriage with someone
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:46.500]   that has the romantic repercussions of a chronic illness.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.500]   And it's good for them to consider, man,
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.500]   what is the impact of that in my life and in our marriage?
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.500]   I need to think through that,
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.500]   not just because it's service to me,
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.500]   but because I want to make sure I can serve that person.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   I need to know what am I signing up for,
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.500]   and who is it that I'm accepting.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   It's not wrong to consider these things.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.500]   In fact, it's right to consider them.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.500]   It's just wrong to accuse someone
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.500]   for that being the issue with them.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.500]   It tears them down.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.500]   They don't have control over it,
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   so do not blame them for it.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   You be clear so long as it's constructive.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   I think that one of the best teachers
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.500]   on how to break up with someone
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.500]   is Cut Day from Hard Knocks.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.500]   If you've ever watched Hard Knocks,
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.500]   which is an HBO series that tracks,
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.500]   whether it's training camp or it's in season with an NFL team,
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.500]   one of the best teachers is the ways
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.500]   in which these coaches meet with players on Cut Day.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.500]   They're trying to whittle the team down to a 53-man roster.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.500]   You see coaches break up with players
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.500]   who have given so much love,
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.500]   and they've given so much time,
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.500]   and they've given so much energy to this team.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.500]   These coaches, they are masterful
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.500]   at being both clear and constructive
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500]   before the guys even sit down.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.500]   "Hey, Jake, you've done great,
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.500]   "but we want to let you know we're going to let you go.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.500]   "Thank you so much for the work that you put in.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500]   "Let me compliment you on a few things.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.500]   "That way you know what you can work on in the future."
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.500]   That's the way those conversations go
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.500]   before they even sit down.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.500]   I think those coaches use a formula
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.500]   that we can learn when it comes to breaking up.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.500]   You see, they always affirm first.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.500]   They sever next, and then they thank last.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.500]   They affirm first, they sever next,
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.500]   and then they thank last.
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.500]   That's something good for us to consider.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.500]   That's the right formula for us to follow
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.500]   if you're breaking up with someone.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.500]   A clear way of speaking to them
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.500]   that is also constructive is,
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.500]   "Hey, I think you're great,
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.500]   "but I don't think we're a great fit together,
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.500]   "and I'd like to break up.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.500]   "I'm really grateful for the time that we've had together."
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.500]   You affirm them, you sever the relationship clearly,
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.500]   let them know we're breaking up.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.500]   This is not just a break.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   And then you thank them.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   You see, someone doesn't have to be a bad person
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.500]   to be a bad fit.
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.500]   And it's our responsibility
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.500]   to make sure that that's really clear.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.500]   And the reason why is because our God
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.500]   is not a God of confusion.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.500]   He is a God of peace.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.500]   That's what Paul says.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   Meaning that when we relate to God,
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   we never wonder where we stand with Him.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   If we placed our faith in Jesus, then we know.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.500]   We're children of God.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.500]   If we've not placed our faith in Christ,
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.500]   then we know we're children of wrath.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.500]   And yet what we always know
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.500]   is where we stand in relationship to God.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.500]   We should do the same to one another.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.500]   We should help others know
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.500]   where they stand in relationship to us.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.500]   We want to be a people, not of confusion,
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   but a people of clarity,
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.500]   a people of peace, like our King.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.500]   The second way that you break up
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.500]   is you act kindly so feelings are considered.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.500]   Act kindly so feelings are considered.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.500]   Ephesians 4, 1 through 3 says,
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.500]   "I therefore, as a prisoner of the Lord,
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.500]   "urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.500]   "to which you've been called,
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.500]   "with all humility and gentleness, with patience,
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.500]   "bearing with one another in love,
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.500]   "eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.500]   "and the bond of peace."
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.500]   Titus 3, 2 says, "Remind them, speak evil of no one,
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.500]   "avoid quarreling, be gentle,
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.500]   "and show perfect courtesy toward all people."
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.500]   Romans 14, 13 and then 19 says,
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.500]   "Therefore, let us not pass judgment
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.500]   "on one another any longer,
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.500]   "but rather decide never to put a stumbling block
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.500]   "or a hindrance in the way of a brother.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.500]   "So then, let us pursue what makes for peace,"
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.500]   and for what?
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.500]   For mutual up-building.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.500]   Do you hear the theme in these verses?
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.500]   Everything we do, every decision we make,
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.500]   every action we take, every word we speak,
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.500]   every place we go,
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.500]   should be done with consideration of the other person.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.500]   The goal is to work in such a way
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.500]   where everything about ourselves,
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.500]   the interactions we have with others,
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.500]   ultimately leads to their well-being.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.500]   Which is why, when it comes to breaking up,
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.500]   you've got to carefully consider a few different things.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.500]   You've got to consider the who, the what, the when,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.500]   the where, and the why of breaking up.
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   You've got to consider the who.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.500]   Who needs to be involved in the breakup?
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.500]   Which I know feels really obvious.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.500]   Kylan, it's probably going to be me and my significant other.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.500]   Which you're not wrong.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.500]   By and large, that's typically the case.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.500]   More often than not,
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.500]   the only people that need to be involved
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.500]   in a breakup with one another
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   are you and then your partner.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.500]   But there are exceptions to this rule.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.500]   You see, there are situations
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.500]   that require the input of other people.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.500]   I've been a part of moments like that.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.500]   Moments that they were prone to a particularly unique risk.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.500]   Whether it was abuse, or it was self-harm,
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.500]   or it was narcissism, or emotional manipulation,
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.500]   or it was something like a strange family dynamic.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.500]   Whatever it was, those situations necessitated
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.500]   the input and involvement of more people
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.500]   than just the couple themselves.
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.500]   You need to consider, is that your moment?
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.500]   What kind of situation you're in.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.500]   Proverbs 14, 14 tells us,
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.500]   "Where there's no guidance, a people falls,
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.500]   "but in an abundance of counselors, there is safety."
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.500]   You see, when you're breaking up with someone,
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.500]   let me be very clear.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.500]   Community should always be consulted before the breakup.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.500]   But sometimes community needs to be involved
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.500]   during the breakup.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.500]   And it's in moments like this.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.500]   Some of you, you're in a moment like this.
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.500]   You're in a moment where you know,
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.500]   the minute you think of having that conversation,
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.500]   it's just gonna be volatile, man.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.500]   Like that guy, he just tends to spin up in anger.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.500]   Or, you know what, I can't really trust myself
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.500]   in that kind of conversation because my tendency
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.500]   is to fold whenever I should stand.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.500]   Or I know, like, I've tried to have that conversation,
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.500]   but every single time we just find ourselves
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.500]   in a cyclical pattern, and we end up right where it was
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.500]   we began.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.500]   If that's you, let me speak very clearly to you.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.500]   You don't have to do that alone.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.500]   Nor should you have to.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   If you feel like your safety is jeopardized
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.500]   through a breakup conversation,
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.500]   will you please come talk to us?
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.500]   Like, would you do us the honor, give us the permission
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   of walking with you through that situation?
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   And listen, I know that can feel really exposing to you.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.500]   Like the thought of coming down and engaging
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.500]   with one of our team members at the end of the service.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.500]   You're going to be like, man, everyone's going to know me,
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.500]   and my boyfriend or my girlfriend's here with me,
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.500]   and I'm never going to be able to live that down.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.500]   Listen, you don't have to come down here at the end of service.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.500]   All you have to do is come grab the hand
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.500]   of someone wearing a black leader shirt
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   in one of our lanyards.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   We would love to help you.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.500]   They will bring you straight to me, straight to my team,
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.500]   and we will process what this looks like.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.500]   But if you're in that spot, you can't stay in that spot.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.500]   In any breakup, the ultimate goal
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:55.500]   is to respect their privacy and ensure your safety.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.500]   That's why it's important that you consider
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.500]   who is it that needs to be in that conversation
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.500]   so that way we can achieve that result.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.500]   That's the who.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.500]   The what is what needs to be said,
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.500]   which we talked a little bit about this,
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.500]   and so I'm not going to spend a ton of time here,
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.500]   but I do think it's important you know
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.500]   that whenever you're communicating in a breakup,
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.500]   a good rule of thumb,
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.500]   if you're the one doing the breaking up,
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.500]   is to use the word "I" instead of the word "you."
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.500]   It is much better to say, "I don't think we're a great fit,"
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.500]   rather than, "You're a monster,
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.500]   and I can't stand the sight of you."
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.500]   You don't want to say that to someone.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.500]   You want to use the word "I."
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.500]   Again, the goal here is to help them understand
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.500]   we don't work as opposed to you don't work for me.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   When we use "I" instead of "you,"
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.500]   we're taking accountability,
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.500]   not just acting accusatorily.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.500]   Now, if in this instance,
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.500]   you're the one being broken up with,
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.500]   it's important that you know
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.500]   what you need to say in that moment as well.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.500]   And yet, if you're blindsided by the breakup,
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.500]   which isn't fair, this is such an aside,
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.500]   let me just say, if you're blindsiding someone in a breakup,
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.500]   that means that you've not dealt clearly with them.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.500]   Doubts and fears and concerns, that stuff,
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.500]   it shouldn't blindside someone.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.500]   It should be discussed over the course of your relationship.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   Whenever those conversations come up,
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.500]   they shouldn't feel like, "What? I had no idea!"
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.500]   Instead, their reaction should be,
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.500]   "You know, we have talked about this,
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.500]   and it makes sense why you feel this way."
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.500]   They shouldn't be blindsided.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.500]   But if in the event you are blindsided by the breakup,
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   it's important that you know what you should say.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.500]   It's difficult in that moment, though,
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.500]   because a million little questions are going to spring to mind.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.500]   "Well, did I do something wrong? Is there someone else?"
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.500]   "Wait, is it too late? Can we make this thing actually work?"
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.500]   "I don't know. Did you ever really care for me?"
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.500]   You're going to process through so many different little questions,
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.500]   and yet it's okay in that moment
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.500]   to hear all of those internal questions
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.500]   and shut them down and look at that person
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.500]   and just simply say, "Hey, this is catching me off guard.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.500]   I appreciate you being honest with me,
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.500]   but could we table this conversation until later in the week
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.500]   once I've been able to collect my thoughts?
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.500]   I'd love to come back more prepared. What do you think?"
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.500]   That's a totally appropriate answer.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.500]   You need to make sure you know what you're saying,
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.500]   because what you say matters in a breakup.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.500]   You've got to consider the when.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.500]   When should it happen?
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.500]   Here's what I tell people.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.500]   You want to choose a time of day that considers the rest of their day.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.500]   Philippians 2.4 says, "Let each of you look not only to his own interests,
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.500]   but also the interests of others."
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.500]   You should consider if you're wanting to break up with someone,
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.500]   what's their schedule look like? Are they going into a meeting?
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.500]   Maybe I shouldn't do this before they go into the office.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.500]   Is it Valentine's Day? That's probably a bad idea.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.500]   You need to consider when you're going to have that conversation.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.500]   I remember a good friend of mine recently told me
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.500]   that he was dating a girl, decided to break up,
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.500]   and it was the day before his birthday.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.500]   He didn't know that she had planned a surprise party for him.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.500]   That's a tough situation to be in,
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.500]   because they were both going to be there.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.500]   They had to figure that out.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.500]   It's important.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.500]   Ideally, you want to make sure that whenever the news drops,
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.500]   they can turn on their Do Not Disturb,
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.500]   they can mark their out of office,
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.500]   and they can retreat away, and they can process their emotions.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.500]   When you do the breakup matters a lot.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.500]   Where you do it also matters.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.500]   Where should you break up?
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.500]   Personal recommendation, I wouldn't do it at dinner.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.500]   It's hard to finish a meal once you've said those things.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   I wouldn't do it on a road trip,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.500]   because chances are you've got several hours left in the car together.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.500]   I wouldn't do it when you're taking a trip,
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.500]   because that's going to spoil the rest of your experience.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.500]   You need to pick a place where, should the rendezvous go south,
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.500]   the breakup blast radius doesn't impact everybody.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.500]   I remember in college, one of my very best friends,
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.500]   he was planning on breaking up with a girl,
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.500]   and he was oddly specific about where he wanted to do it.
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.500]   He knew he wanted to do it at night,
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.500]   on her front porch, sitting on those steps.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   So I asked him, "Dude, why do you care so much about the specifics of this?"
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.500]   And I'll never forget his answer. It was so thoughtful.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.500]   He looked at me and said, "I know it needs to be in the evening,
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.500]   because that will mean she has nothing else planned
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.500]   for the rest of her day.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.500]   I want it to be on her porch, because then she can go inside,
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.500]   and she can either process with her friends, or she can sit alone.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.500]   And I want to do it from her front porch steps,
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   because we have processed highs and lows in our relationship from that place.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.500]   And I think the familiarity will be comforting to her."
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.500]   That's how you want to break up with someone.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.500]   You want to be thoughtful of the where.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.500]   Now, a couple of ideas.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   You need to pick a place where you can see them face to face,
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:06.500]   and it is on their turf. That matters.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.500]   You want to see them face to face.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:13.500]   It's dignifying to look someone in the eye whenever you deliver them hard news.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.500]   And doing it on their turf ensures that you've prepared the space
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.500]   to be as accommodating and comfortable as possible once the moment is over,
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.500]   and they need to go and they need to process through their raw emotion.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   And then lastly, you've got to consider why.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.500]   Why do you want to break up?
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.500]   Now, let me be very clear.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.500]   The why here actually is less for the benefit of the other person,
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.500]   and it's more for the benefit of yourself.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:41.500]   You want to make sure they know ultimately, with clear words,
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.500]   why the relationship is ending.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:49.500]   But if they come to you, and they're asking a list of little detailed questions,
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.500]   wondering why this is happening,
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.500]   you're not obligated to answer every single one of those.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.500]   And the reason why is that's ultimately not trying to end the relationship.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.500]   That is trying to save the relationship,
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.500]   which works against the decision that you, as you've prayed to God,
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.500]   and you've consulted with community, have decided is best.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.500]   You need to know why.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.500]   The reason for it is because in the heat of battle,
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.500]   what compels troops to keep going?
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.500]   A compelling reason.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.500]   In the heat of heartache, what's going to compel you to keep going?
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.500]   A compelling reason.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.500]   Like once emotions flare up, and feelings start to freak,
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.500]   and they start to cry, and questions start to rise,
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.500]   you're going to need something, a bedrock of belief,
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.500]   that this is worth the effort,
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.500]   that this is not a bad decision,
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.500]   because we're all people pleasers.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.500]   And the worst way you can please someone is by giving them what they want,
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.500]   yet they do not need in a breakup scenario.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.500]   We want to conduct ourselves in a way that's kind towards the other person,
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.500]   that considers their well-being.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.500]   And the reason why is this is how Christ has conducted himself towards us.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.500]   If you think about it, Jesus knew the who.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.500]   He saw us very clearly.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.500]   He knew that we were sinners in need of saving.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.500]   He knew the what?
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.500]   That it would require a perfect life, a death he didn't deserve,
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.500]   and he'd have to rise forth and take back his life into his own hands.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.500]   He knew the when.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.500]   At the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.500]   He knew the where.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.500]   He would carry our cross up Calvary,
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.500]   and he knew the why, that I want to be with him forever.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   Jesus knew all of these variables when it came to pursuing you.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.500]   It's good for us to consider these things
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.500]   as we process how we want to break up with one another.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.500]   And then the third way that we break up
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.500]   is we process cleanly so closure is achieved.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.500]   We process cleanly so closure is achieved.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.500]   Breaking up needs to be clear and kind and clean.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.500]   That's kind of the idea here.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.500]   Matthew 5:9 says, "Blessed are the peacemakers,
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.500]   for they shall be called the sons of God."
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.500]   Romans 12, 17, 18 says, "Repay no one for evil,
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.500]   but give thought to do what's honorable in the sight of all.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:07.500]   If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all."
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:13.500]   Hebrews 12, 14 says, "Strive for peace, and do so with everyone.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.500]   And for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord."
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.500]   You see, contrary to what the culture will tell you,
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:26.500]   the right response to a breakup is not revenge, it's resolution.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.500]   It's resolution.
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.500]   I was listening in prep for this message in specific.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.500]   I was listening to a podcast that walked through a detailed guide of sorts
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.500]   on how to break up with someone.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:40.500]   And at the end of it all, they assigned this advice.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:45.500]   They said, "Have revenge sex, enjoy your newfound freedom, and adopt a
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.500]   'where's my next victim' vibe."
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.500]   Here's the issue with that advice.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.500]   And I want to be very clear, I'm not picking on the podcast.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.500]   I think that that is just an example of the commentary
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.500]   and commendation of our culture.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.500]   But here's the issue with it.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.500]   That advice is not processing the pain of loss.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.500]   It's just coping with it.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.500]   It's just coping with it.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.500]   You see, that could feel crazy.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.500]   It's easy to hear something like that and wag our finger and shake our head
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.500]   and assume, "Why would you ever do such a thing?"
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:24.500]   And yet, when you study the science, you realize this makes perfect sense.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:28.500]   The fact that people default into coping mechanisms to take care of their heartache
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.500]   is not uncommon.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.500]   You see, romantic love releases a flood of feel-good brain chemicals,
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.500]   things like dopamine and serotonin and oxytocin.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.500]   And the more affection and the more intimacy and the more experience
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.500]   you share with one another, the stronger that chemical bond becomes.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.500]   It's a stout chemical cocktail of sorts.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.500]   And the minute you remove the person who's been preparing that sort of
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:56.500]   interaction for you, your body, it freaks out and it starts to search
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:03.500]   for another source or stimuli to continue those feel-good chemicals.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.500]   It's why people ultimately find themselves, after a breakup,
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:11.500]   slipping into things like alcohol and pornography and binging and codependency
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.500]   and all manner of other different things.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:18.500]   It's not because they're evil people and they're trying to do bad.
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.500]   They're just trying to move on.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.500]   But the truth is they're just falling behind.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   There's a better path to take instead.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.500]   And that path is we seek peace.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.500]   That's what all those verses we read at the very top were talking about.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.500]   We seek peace.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.500]   Like, we seek closure.
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.500]   We try to move on.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.500]   I think one of the best examples of this in the Scripture is King David
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.500]   in 2 Samuel.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:47.500]   You see that after he and Bathsheba have had their affair and she's given birth
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:53.500]   to her firstborn, he fasts and he weeps in desperate attempt to save the life
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.500]   of that child.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.500]   And yet the minute that child dies, his servant comes to him and is like,
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.500]   "Why aren't you weeping?
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.500]   Why aren't you fasting anymore?"
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:07.500]   And David looks at his servant and he just says, "The child is dead.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.500]   That moment has passed.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.500]   And now I rise up and I move on."
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.500]   That's David's perspective.
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   He understands my heartache has been processed because I've prayed my way
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   through it and now I can move forward.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.500]   And we should do the same thing.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.500]   We need to process cleanly.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.500]   What does that even mean?
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:34.500]   Well, if you think about it, surgeons, they don't address wounds in dirty
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.500]   and disordered spaces.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.500]   That wouldn't be productive.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.500]   Why?
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   Because that would only further the infection.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.500]   How do surgeons ultimately address wounds?
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.500]   They do so in a way where the space is sterile, it is clean, it is safe,
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.500]   and it is ordered.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.500]   We must address the wounds of our heart in a similar fashion.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:57.500]   We've got to make sure that we're attending to the hurt and heartache we have
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.500]   in a proper way.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.500]   So I'm going to give you five ways that you should do this.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.500]   If you're curious, how do I move on, here it is.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500]   Five things you should consider.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   Number one is you should take time.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.500]   You should take time.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.500]   There's no average life cycle to how long it takes to move on from a relationship.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.500]   I did a lot of study and I tried to figure that out, and it varies.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.500]   And yet one thing is true.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.500]   It's going to take time.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   Not because time heals all things, but because God heals all things,
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   and he does so in his time.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.500]   Psalm 147, verse 3, it tells us he heals the brokenhearted,
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.500]   and he binds up their wounds.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.500]   And so the goal is to stick as close to him as possible for as long as it takes.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.500]   I remember the deepest heartache I ever faced,
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.500]   which wasn't relational with something else altogether.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   It took way longer than I expected, and it took way longer than I wanted.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   And yet I remember being comforted in the fact that it did not take longer than God expected,
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.500]   and it did not take longer than God wanted.
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:03.500]   It was through that season of suffering that I found myself nearer to him than I had ever been,
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   learning things the likes of which I'd never known.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.500]   And so take time.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.500]   It took you this long to get into the relationship.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   It's going to take you time to get out of the relationship.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   That's the first thing.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.500]   The second thing is you've got to limit contact.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   You've got to limit contact.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   Don't respond to their stories because you're hoping that you're going to be able to rekindle the relationship.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.500]   Don't stalk them on social media because you're wondering, "Are you hurting just as the way I am?"
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.500]   Don't do that.
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   Don't look at old photos of the two of you,
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.500]   reminiscing on the times gone by because there are no times coming ahead.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   You need to limit contact with one another.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.500]   Don't do these things to yourself.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.500]   Resist the temptation. Remove the exposure.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.500]   And let me just be very clear.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   If you're here and you're the one that has done the breaking up or planning to do the breaking up,
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.500]   then you need to know, and I cannot say this more strongly,
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:59.500]   you do not contact them to see how they're doing.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   That's not your job.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.500]   But I still want to be friends with them.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.500]   You're not friends with them anymore.
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.500]   Like the minute you decided to date them, the nature of your relationship, it changed.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.500]   They've got other friends.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.500]   They have community that can care for them.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.500]   You are not allowed to be the cause of their pain as well as the cure to it.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.500]   So do not pick up the phone and try to check on that person.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:26.500]   Some of you, you're probably here and you're thinking, "But I want to seek their forgiveness."
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:34.500]   They can give you their forgiveness without you ever discussing the issue.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:41.500]   In God's time, should that conviction deepen and you not be able to shake the feeling,
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   through prayer and consultation, you can seek after it.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.500]   But take time and limit contact.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.500]   The third thing is you've got to gather community.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   There's a saying that misery loves company, which is true.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   You need to be careful the company you keep because you don't want people that are going to exacerbate
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   your unrequited love for that person.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   You don't want them to pour fuel on feelings that you don't need to catch any longer.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.500]   You need to be careful who it is that you gather around you.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.500]   But you do need to gather people around you.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.500]   According to the Journal of Social, Psychological, and Personality Science,
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:20.500]   participants who process their recent breakups faced better than participants who did not.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.500]   You see, it was by answering questions and processing their emotions
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.500]   through the context of community that people were able to move on more quickly
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.500]   from their breakup than those that didn't.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.500]   And that matches what God says.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.500]   Proverbs 12, 15 says, "The wave of fools is right in his own eyes,
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.500]   but a wise man listens to advice."
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:43.500]   Now, let me just speak to the guys in the room because we're bad at this.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.500]   We're really bad at sharing our feelings.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.500]   And this isn't me trying to poke fun or make a joke about the traditional male stereotype.
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:58.500]   No, it's statistically proven that guys, not girls, actually struggle on the heels of a breakup,
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.500]   more so than most.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:07.500]   And the reason for that is women, they have developed the skill of finding emotional support
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.500]   outside the confines of a romantic relationship.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.500]   They have friends, and they have family, and they have neighbors.
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.500]   And guys don't typically have that.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:21.500]   Guys typically have one source of emotional support, and it's their girlfriend or their wife.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:29.500]   It's the reason why SNL came up with a skit years ago that made a joke at this specific reality.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:35.500]   It was a group of women who took their husbands to not a dog park, but to the man park.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:40.500]   And the goal of that time is guys could talk about the NFL, the Avengers,
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:45.500]   and they could sip IPAs as they built relationships with one another.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.500]   Something similar needs to happen in your life, guys.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:52.500]   You need to find friends, not just for love, but for life,
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.500]   because you need emotional support.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.500]   You need people that you can process your pain with.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.500]   This applies to you too, ladies.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.500]   The fourth thing is you've got to embrace reality.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.500]   This one will be fast, but if you've ever said following a breakup,
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.500]   "I just don't have peace about his logic on this thing,"
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.500]   I think we need to process that a little bit more.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.500]   Let me be very clear.
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:18.500]   You can disagree and still have peace.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.500]   It's not that you don't have peace with his logic.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.500]   It's that you don't have peace with your reality.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.500]   And so you just need to embrace the fact that this is the hand you've been dealt.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.500]   And then lastly, you need to resist the rebound.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.500]   You've got to resist the rebound.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.500]   I'm not talking about breakup sex, though you should avoid that too.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:44.500]   Really what I'm getting at is you don't confuse breaking up with breaking off.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.500]   Oftentimes, couples, they will break off the relationship for a time.
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.500]   "We're going to take a break."
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.500]   You don't do that.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.500]   If you're planning on breaking up, that is a severing of the relationship.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.500]   We are going different directions, and we're not going to interact,
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.500]   which means you need to let your yes be yes and your no be no.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.500]   Like, if you decide to break up with him,
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.500]   then you don't get to go back and forth with that person.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.500]   You need to stick to your standard.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.500]   You need to believe God's Word,
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:15.500]   and you need to be a man or a woman that is faithful to what you have spoken.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.500]   You see, as Christians, our vision of moving on
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.500]   is not just a movement away from a painful past.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.500]   It is a movement towards a hope-filled future.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.500]   And the reason for that is it accords with the Bible's standard of peace.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:32.500]   You see, in the Bible, the idea of peace is not just the absence of chaos.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.500]   It is the presence of flourishing.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.500]   So no matter if you're doing the breaking up
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.500]   or you're the one being broken up with,
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:46.500]   your hope, it's not attached to what happened in the past.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.500]   It's attached to the promise you hold in the future,
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.500]   that though you may have heartache back there,
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.500]   you have a God up there,
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.500]   and He's the one that gives you hope for the future,
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.500]   which is what Brooke reminded me of at the very end of her letter.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   Because though at the beginning of it,
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.500]   she spoke good reason and cause for concern,
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:12.500]   and so many of the things she said were right for the time,
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:19.500]   at the end of it, she reminded me of why we have hope.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.500]   She said, "I wanted to give you my honest heart,
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.500]   because as off or as warped as it may seem,
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.500]   it's something that I think you deserve to hear.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.500]   I'm praying for us.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.500]   I'm praying for God's clarity, God's nearness,
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.500]   and God's protection in our relationship."
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:44.500]   Why would she pray for those things?
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.500]   Because Brooke knew, when I'm praying, you'd know,
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.500]   that when we were lost in confusion,
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.500]   confused about our relationship to God
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   and our relationship with one another,
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.500]   Christ stepped in to speak clarity into our reality.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.500]   He wanted to help us understand
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.500]   where we stood in relationship to Him.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   When we failed to act kindly,
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.500]   both to one another and to God Himself,
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:15.500]   Jesus, He showed us the greatest demonstration of kindness,
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.500]   and that He came near to us,
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.500]   not just near to us in life, but near to us in death,
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.500]   and now near to us forever.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.500]   And when we were anything but clean,
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.500]   stained in our sin and marred by our mistakes
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:33.500]   and facing the finality of our filth,
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.500]   Jesus, He offered us protection.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.500]   He preserved the relationship,
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.500]   and the way He did so was by washing us clean
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.500]   through both His body and His blood.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:50.500]   Friends, listen, we severed our relationship from God,
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:54.500]   but Christ saved our relationship to God.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:44:00.500]   We broke from Him, but He broke for us.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.500]   Do you know Him?
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.500]   No other relationship matters
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.500]   before that one first and foremost.
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.500]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.500]   God, thanks for tonight and this time and your Word
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:17.500]   and just the sufficiency of it for our lives.
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.500]   God, breaking up is hard.
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.500]   Dating is hard.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   Romance is hard.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.500]   Relationships are hard.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.500]   But God, we do not have to process them
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.500]   nor navigate them on our own.
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.500]   I think about the world and the way that they move through
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.500]   these tumultuous waters,
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.500]   and God, what I know is they're trying to do so
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:46.500]   on the basis of guru guidance and worldly wisdom.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.500]   But we don't have to do that.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:52.500]   God, we have your Word, and it is true.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.500]   It is beautifully, beautifully true,
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.500]   and the reason we know it's true
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.500]   is because everything, God, we have talked about
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.500]   in this moment, every principle that we've walked through,
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:06.500]   you, Jesus, have already personified.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:10.500]   We see in you the perfect demonstration,
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.500]   display of everything that we, God,
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:17.500]   want to be true of our relationships now.
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.500]   And yet, God, I pray we would not try to do them
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.500]   by way of our own reason.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.500]   We would do them by way of relation to you.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.500]   Help us, God, for those here that do not know you,
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:33.500]   I pray they would place their faith in you, God,
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.500]   receive forgiveness for their sins,
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.500]   and live with you, God, forever,
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.500]   not just one day in heaven, but here today, right now.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.500]   And then, God, for those in the room
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.500]   that already know you, God,
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.500]   I pray you would reveal a next step,
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.500]   something they need to do,
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.500]   not, God, because they're desperate for your love,
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.500]   but because, God, they've already received it,
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.500]   and that changes the way they move.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:07.500]   And then, God, I pray, I pray humbly,
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:11.500]   for those in the room that need to break up,
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:16.500]   God, I pray they wouldn't feel a pressure from me.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.500]   God, I pray they'd feel a conviction from you.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.500]   And for those, God, that have been broken up with,
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:27.500]   I pray, God, they'd know you're near the brokenhearted.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:28.500]   You saved the crushed in spirit.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.500]   We love you.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.500]   We sing to you now.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.500]   We thank God for this evening.
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.500]   It's in your name we pray, amen.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.500]   Hey, Porch, what I want us to do
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.500]   is just to take a posture of openness before the Lord.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.500]   I don't know what that looks like for you,
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.500]   but we're gonna respond in worship.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.500]   This moment matters a lot
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.500]   because this is the moment where you've sung to God
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.500]   and you've heard from God,
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.500]   and now you get to respond to him.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.500]   If you wanna respond in prayer,
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.500]   we've got a team down here to my right and to my left.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.500]   They would love to pray with you
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.500]   if you wanna sit where you are
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.500]   and consider things silently, that's okay too.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.500]   If you wanna stand and sing with us,
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.500]   we'll be doing that all across the room.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.500]   But let's respond to the Lord right now,
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.500]   he who has sought after relationship with us.
