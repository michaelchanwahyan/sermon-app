[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500]   I mean, he's practically dating a model.
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.500]   She told me they went to Cabo, and he paid for the whole thing.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000]   Dude, she does his laundry and cooks.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   He proposed at the Eiffel Tower. In Paris.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Bro, she plays in his fantasy football league, and knows more about the Cowboys than he does.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.500]   She's got the husband, the house, she's got it all.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500]   What more could you ask for?
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.000]   What more could you ask for? How we doing, The Porch?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Thank you for being here. Dallas, Fort Worth, we're so excited you guys are watching.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Downtown Dallas, thank you guys for hanging out with us there this summer.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   We'll see you here next week. Houston, Texas, we're so glad you guys are gathered there as well.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   We are excited about this series and what God is doing through the lives of young adults.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   He's changing the world through the lives of young adults.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   That's why we do this. We are just pumped.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   We're continuing our series, Relationship Goals.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I'll start with a story. Twelve years ago, September 20th will be marked 12 years.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I and my lovely wife, Monica, were headed to our honeymoon.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   We had just got married.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   The day after our wedding, we are in DFW Airport,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   about to go to the Riviera Maya in Mexico Beach,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   all-inclusive resort for a week.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   We're so pumped about it. We are so excited.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We go to the airport. We get there early.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   We park at remote north parking because that's what you do when you're a good steward.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   We had four bags just like this.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I remember we had these four bags.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I'm trying to be chivalrous. I'm trying to be a gentleman, a good husband now that I'm 24 hours in.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I'm like, "Hey, you take this one, baby. I'll get these three."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I'm loading them up on the bus one by one.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   We take the bus to the terminal.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   There, where the bus dropped us off, to get to the gate to check in, you had to go up this escalator.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   DFW has the biggest escalators.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   It drops us off at this escalator. We got these four bags.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   This is not where I dog on her for bringing a bunch of bags because in reality, I'm the shopper in our family.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   She had two bags. I had two bags.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   We were created equal and equally yoked, if you will.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   There we are. I'm like, "All right, sweetie. You got your bag. I got these three."
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I get them on the escalator. It's complicated because those stairs move.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I got one on and then the other. I'm holding them.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm doing this act. She's right here just below me.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I got her bag and I got these three.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   When we get to the top of the escalator, the sides of the escalator don't move.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   The sides are not moving. The side kind of grabs one of the bags and it lurches me forward.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I bump her and then she begins to fall down the stairs.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I grab onto her and when I do, I begin to fall on top of her.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Three bags falling on top of me. I'm not lying.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   We fall from the top of the escalator to the bottom of the escalator.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I'm laying there on my back. She's on top of me. Bags on top of her.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I'm bleeding.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I'm like, "This is how it starts?"
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Like, "Is this a bad omen or something? This cannot be good."
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Like, "I'm hurt. My leg is bleeding."
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   The moral to the story is don't go on your honeymoon with a bunch of baggage.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   It happened. It's true.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I believe the Lord gave me that so 12 years later I can say that line.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Do not go on your honeymoon with a bunch of baggage.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   That's what we're going to talk about tonight as we move through this series.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   We're not on the date yet. I'm well aware of that.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   We've been talking about the prerequisites to dating.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   First, that you date for marriage.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   To date for marriage you have to have an understanding, a biblical worldview of what marriage is.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Then we talked about this idea that we love people.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   To love people we have to go back to the author of love, the one who invented love,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   the one who claims that he is love, to understand how to love.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Next week we'll move towards the date.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   We'll move towards looking for the one that we're going to spend the rest of our life with.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   But this week we have to deal with our baggage.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I don't know if anybody in the room, if there's 3,600 people here,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   there's 3,600 people with baggage here.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   You have baggage. You have to know what it is.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   How amazing this evening if we can identify our baggage and you,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   so you don't have to be like me, you don't have to take it on your honeymoon.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You don't have to take your baggage into marriage.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Could you imagine how powerful that would be?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I hope tonight is not a burden for you. I hope that it presents to you hope.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   At some point in this message you may feel guilty, you may feel weight,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   you may feel condemnation or conviction.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I just want you to hang in there with me.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Hang in there because there's good news this evening from the Scriptures
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   as we dive into the Scriptures.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   What more loving thing could you do for your future spouse
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   than to begin tonight to intentionally deal with the baggage from your past?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   The baggage that you carry around with you today, whether you realize it or not.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Some of you will realize that you have baggage that you're carrying with you.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   That means that you shouldn't be dating right now.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   That you need to take a season.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Some of you will realize that you need to end a relationship tonight.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Okay, don't leave. Take a deep breath.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   No need to elbow anybody. Just hang in there.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Let's look at the Scriptures for hope because here's what I can promise you.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   If you do things according to God's plan, he'll bless that.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You trusting yourself over God's plan will never, ever, not one single time,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   not ever go well for you.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And so let's just see what he has to say from these ancient texts this evening.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And I do hope that you leave with hope.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   As we move through this text here in Colossians chapter 3,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   we're going to look at unchecked sins, unchecked hurts,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   and before you leave here this evening, unchecked lies that you are believing.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Now it's not often that I always kind of will read the Scriptures and learn things.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So I'll learn things, but it's not often that I'll see something that will just kind of blow my mind.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Like, "Wow, I never realized that before. That happened to me this week."
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   That happened to me this week, and so I want to share that with you,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   what I learned from the Scriptures this week because I never noticed something.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   In Ephesians chapter 5, Colossians 3, and 1 Corinthians 6,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   the Apostle Paul, who wrote these letters to the churches there in Colossae and Ephesus and Corinth,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   he wrote these letters. That's what these Scriptures are,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   these ancient texts that the Holy Spirit preserved for us.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   They're just, at least in the New Testament, the epistles, those are letters to literal churches.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And so he doesn't know that he's writing Scriptures.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   He's just writing letters. He's saying, "Hey, this is how you should conduct the church.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Hey, these are things that you need to be aware of.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Hey, this is what it means to live a godly life, a holy life, to pursue Christ.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   This is what Christ has done for you."
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   So he's just writing these letters that now we read and we apply to our lives.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   But what was interesting to me about these letters to the church in Ephesus, Colossae, and Corinth
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   is that he talks about marriage in all three of them.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   He talks about the role of a husband and the role of a wife in all three of them.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And in all three of those letters, right before he talks about marriage,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   he gives a list of sins and he says, "That's what you were. That's not who you are.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   You need to put these to death. You need to put them aside.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   You need to take them off and put on the clothes of Christ to realize who you were."
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   See, some of you came in here this evening and you have an identity problem.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   You have to go back to the basics of the gospel and realize who you are in Jesus Christ.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And so I'm going to tell you where the other two places are.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I don't have time to cover right now. That's your homework.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I want you to look this up. Write these down.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   So in Ephesians chapter 5, this is where husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Right before that, in verses 3 through 8, he gives us this list of sins.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   In 1 Corinthians 6, which is right before 1 Corinthians 7,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   where he talks about the role of a husband, the role of a wife, the Christian household.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   In 1 Corinthians 6, verses 9 through 11, he gives us a very similar list of sin, lots of overlap.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And then again, where we'll be tonight in Colossians chapter 3.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And so this blew my mind this week and I'm glad I can share that with you.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I want you to go home and study it for yourselves.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   But we'll be in Colossians 3, verses 5 through 10 this evening.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Very similar list. He says this.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   You, porch, you used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived, your old life, your past life,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   your BC life, your before Christ life.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   But now, you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these, anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its creator."
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   He says, "Hey, porch, that's who you were. You're not that anymore.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Stop continuing in those ways. Christ has made you new.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   He's given you some new clothes to wear.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   You don't have to wear those old grave clothes.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   You don't have to carry around that old baggage.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   That's not who you are.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   You're a new creation, with the Holy Spirit living inside of you, purchased with a price.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Walk in that way. Check that baggage."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And so, my first point this evening is, sin left unchecked leads to addictions.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I've realized that as I've met with young adults, there are three categories of baggage that I want to pull from this scripture,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   that I think are the three biggest categories of baggage for everyone here.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And the first one is addiction.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   This comes from your pet sins.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   This is the bag that you carry around with you.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   These are those little pet sins that you have in your life.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And so, if we open this bag, what's inside? These are the clothes you can't get rid of.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   You know that old comfy sweatshirt that you like to wear when you're watching movies?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   You know, these are the clothes that you just, maybe it's something that has, you know, some...
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It's okay. It's okay.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Like, I don't know if butterfly collars and pearl snaps are still in, but...
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   It's true religion. I paid way too much for this shirt, and so I'm going to keep it, okay?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   That's not going to goodwill.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   And I don't know when the engineer pants are coming back in style, but these always fit just perfect.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   And I just can't... And who else wears 36 inseam? I mean, I can't get rid of them.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   But you guys know these sins. You know these ones that you can't...
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I mean, some of these things are very familiar to you.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And you know the addiction that they've caused in your life.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   You know the things that rule you.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Talked about that comfy sweatshirt you can't get rid of.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And you're carrying them around with you.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And it desires to end your marriage long before your marriage ever started.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Desires to hurt your spouse before you ever even meet them.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   These sins. These sins that are left unchecked that grow into something that controls you.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry."
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   These things are addiction.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And so I want to talk about the first few on the list, because these are the ones he repeats over and over.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   He talks about sexual immorality and impurity and lust.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   These are the ones that I've noticed as I've met with you tend to be some of the biggest baggage that folks here carry.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   They come from your addiction to pornography, your past sex life, your encounters, be it one time at prom or be it right before you came here.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Maybe it's like, "Well, we're married in God's eyes," or "We're going to," or "It's a committed relationship."
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   "I think it's okay." Read your Bible.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Understand God's Word.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   You're behind a lie.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   I don't know if you've ever noticed that we create categories for sex.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   We create different categories for it.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   The other day I was talking to a young man.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   He told me he was struggling with pornography.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   By struggling, I mean he was falling into it.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   There was no struggle.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   The struggle was him falling victim to pornography and giving himself to it on a weekly, regular basis.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   He said, "Yeah, I look at porn every week, but at least I'm still a virgin."
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   I want you to hear what I said to him.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   I said, "Why do you think Jesus is a liar?"
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   He said, "I don't think Jesus is a liar."
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I said, "Well, why would you call yourself a virgin?"
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   I read in the Scripture, Matthew 5, verse 28 says,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   "I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her."
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Jesus said you're not a virgin.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Now listen closely.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I don't say that to condemn you, or to hurt you, or to put condemnation on you.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   You've got to remember, Jesus, the one who said those words, is the one who paid for that sin to make you a new creation.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   But why do we put these categories around sex as if one is better than another,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and I'll live with this one as long as it's not that one?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   I think we have to redefine what this even means.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I believe the reason Jesus is saying this is because he knows how dangerous and detrimental to a healthy marriage that activity is.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   If we've hung out long at all, you know that derailed my marriage two years in.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And not that I was actively looking at porn two years into marriage,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   but I was actively looking at porn the 12 years before marriage.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And it almost cost me my marriage.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   I'm so passionate about this.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   This is why Jesus says, "Do everything you can to get rid of it."
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off, people.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Get rid of it.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Get rid of the computer.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Who needs it?
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   What are we doing?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Do whatever it takes to deal with these sins that seek to kill you.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And so I'm talking about any kind of sex outside of marriage.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Oral sex, anal sex, sexting, gay sex, straight sex.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Any kind of sex.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   As you pursue sexual pleasure outside of marriage, just to clear the categories.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   God is saying, "Hey, you're hurting yourself."
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And I have something better for you.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I'm not just trying to give you rules to follow to make you feel guilty.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I'm trying to set you free and give you life so that you can have it abundantly, he says.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   There's this misunderstanding around this word, "sex."
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Sex is nowhere in the Bible.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   It's not mentioned in the scripture.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   We have different words.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Sex is an English word that we use to describe this activity.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   But in fact, I have a friend that says, "I don't even talk about sex inside of marriage."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Because people have such a skewed view.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Young adults going into marriage have such a skewed view of what it is.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   He actually speaks to premarriage often.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And he says, "You know what? I hope you never have sex."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   These are couples that are just about to get married.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   He says, "I hope you never have sex," which he gets all their attention.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And he says, "I hope that you pursue intimacy and oneness in marriage."
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   He says, "Sex is something dogs do on the side of the street."
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   I hope that you pursue intimacy and oneness with one another.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   We don't know that.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Some of you will never have that.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And I'm not saying that you will never have sex.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   You may only just have sex.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And God has something better for you.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   You're learning the wrong way.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   You're training your heart and your mind for something distantly second, third, fourth, best.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   When God has something much better for you.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   The Hebrew word that we translate sex is literally mingling of souls.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   What a beautiful reality.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   And so I've talked about that one.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   He says, "Sexual immorality, impurity."
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   But listen, addictions that you need to check can be anything.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   If you're addicted to alcohol, cigarettes, anorexia, bulimia, eating disorders, an addiction to food.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   It could be an addiction to working out.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   It could be an addiction to things.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Maybe you love to shop.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   You wake up in the morning.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   You go to Woot.com.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   You go to Amazon.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   You can't wait to buy something.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Maybe it's masturbation for you.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Maybe it's gambling.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   You love to go to Shreveport or Vegas or play Hold 'Em or whatever that is for you.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Maybe it's an addiction to people, relationships.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   You're codependent.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   You look back and you realize you've never been single since the fifth grade.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   You've got a problem.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   You've got to deal with it.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Paul says, "Greed, materialism."
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   In 1 Corinthians 6, he goes on to say, "I will not be mastered by anything."
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   You have an addiction.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   If you can't go, say, three months without something, that's an addiction.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   See, I don't think we ever think we have an addiction.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   There's so many of you that have been looking at pornography at least every month since the fifth grade.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   You wouldn't say, "Well, I'm addicted."
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   You wouldn't even say that word.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Can I tell you something?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   As a friend who loves you, you're addicted.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   You're an addict.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   You need help.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And help's available.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   That's the good news.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   I've found healing.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I was an addict.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   I've been healed.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   I've been set free.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   I walk in freedom, and you can too.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Often, these addictions in our lives, they lead to deep hurts.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And these deep hurts turn to us lashing out in anger.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And that's what Paul writes in verse 7.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   "You used to walk in these ways, friends."
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   That's who you were.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   That's the life you once lived.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   That's who you were.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   It's not who you are.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   "But now you must also," verse 8, "you must also rid yourself of all such things as these."
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Anger, rage, malice, slander, filthy language from your lips, cursing.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   My second point this evening is that hurts left unchecked lead to anger.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Hurts left unchecked lead to anger.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   This is that bag that we don't want to show anyone.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   This bag.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   This is that one that we don't want anybody to see what's in it.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   We don't want to deal with that thing that happened.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   We don't want to face it.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   It's hard to open.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   It's heavy.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   It's got weights in it, rocks in it, been carrying around.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   These are things that happened to you.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   These are clothes that have been given to you.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   I wouldn't buy that.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Somebody gave that to me.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And they're heavy and they're thick.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Someone passed it on to you.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Someone did that to you.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   And now you've got this weight and you're carrying it around.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   You don't want anyone to see it.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   It's hard to hide.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   It shows up in traffic.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   It shows up when things don't go your way, when you don't get the promotion.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   It shows up when you realize the state that you're in.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   When you feel like God's ripping you off, this shows up.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   And you are just waiting for someone to come along so that they can make you feel better.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And you're going to sink them.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   You're going to latch on to them.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   And you're going to weigh them down with your anger and your malice and your rage and your cursing and your broken heart.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   These hurts, they can be anything.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   They can come from anywhere.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   It comes from past relationships, a breakup.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Someone stole your heart.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Why'd they do that to you?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Ended up cheating on you.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Betrayal.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Caused hurts.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   An abortion.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Partnered with that.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Tried to hide something.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Tried to fix it.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   That can cause this.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   There's healing, friends.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   You don't have to carry that weight around.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   We're not mad at you.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   We're not mad at you.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   We love you.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   God loves you.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   He's not mad at you.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   He just wants to talk about it.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Can we just talk about it?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   You're going to hide that your whole life?
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   You're going to take that to the grave?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   No, you're not.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   You're going to die from the inside out, slowly carrying around that weight.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   It can be from parents.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   A parent that left.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   You don't understand why a divorce that you experienced,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   that still hurts when you think about it,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   caused a damage that you never wanted to admit,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   or maybe you do admit it,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   or maybe your parents did this weird thing.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   It was a performance-based acceptance.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   They said, "Hey, I love you as long as you're good,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   "as long as you get the ribbon,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   "as long as you get the trophy,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   "as long as you make the team,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   "as long as you perform,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   "as long as you look my friends in their eyes.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   "Yes, sir.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   "No, sir.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   "Yes, ma'am.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   "No, ma'am."
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   As long as you do these things,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   you're going to feel love from me,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   but if you don't do these things,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   you're going to feel like I regret you.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Gosh.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   That's heavy.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   That's a heavy, heavy weight.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   It can come from abuse, friends.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Any kind of abuse.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   It can be physical abuse.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Someone taking their anger out on you.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   You swear you'll never be like that,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   but the stuff is passed on like a disease,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   one person to the next.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   People who say they'll never be that way,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   it just goes, just perpetuates itself.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Example, such a strong force.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   It can be mental abuse.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Maybe you dated someone that played mind games with you.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   They said they loved you,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   but they consistently hurt you,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   and this causes this.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   It can be the unspeakable sexual abuse
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   that you swear you'd never deal with.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I know that's heavy.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I know it's heavy.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I've sat with you.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I've talked with you in my office.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I know it's heavy,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   but we've got to deal with it tonight.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   We've got to stop carrying it around.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   We've got to find healing from this.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   The truth is, friends,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   the truth is most of us here tonight
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   have experienced sexual abuse.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   That's the reality.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   You probably, in ways that you're naive to,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   have experienced sexual abuse.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Let me redefine the term for you.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Sex or intimacy between two people
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   was God's invention,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   a genius invention, I might add,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   for marriage.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   If you've had sex outside the context of marriage of any kind,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   you've abused it.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   You've gone against the Creator's design,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   and you have been a part of a force
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   that is so much stronger and more powerful
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   than you could ever imagine.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   The world tries to convince you that it's no big deal,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   and that is why the world is suffering as it is today.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Why divorce rates climb while marriage has declined.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Kids born out of wedlock.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   The hurts that we see today,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   because they keep telling you, "No big deal."
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   We've experienced sexual abuse,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   and we've never experienced healing from that.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   But let me tell you something.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   There's hope, because
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   if you have been a victim of any kind of abuse,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   and you appropriately heal from it,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   you expose it, you bring it into the light,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   God begins to repair your heart.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   You are given one of the most powerful forces in the world.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   It's called empathy.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Hurt people who carry around weight,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   hurt people, hurt people, hurt people.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   But healed people have the power of the Holy Spirit in them
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   when they've been healed through the blood of Christ Jesus,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   through confession, repentance,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   dealing with their sins, their struggles, their hurts.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   And they go through recovery,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   and healed people heal people.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   And you have that opportunity to go through that.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I've seen this, man.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   I have a friend who had been divorced,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   gone through all kinds of crazy relationships,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   found identity in men,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   got pregnant, had an abortion,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   carried that weight.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And went through a recovery program
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   for those who had an abortion.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And you know what she had to do?
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   She had to carry these rocks with her everywhere she went
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   until she was ready to receive the grace of Christ.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And I was with her.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   We were in the Amazon jungle, true story,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   on a boat, on an international discipleship trip to the Amazon.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   And she took those rocks to the top of that boat,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   and she threw them in the Amazon River
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   and said, "I am ready to receive the grace of Christ.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   "I am ready to extend forgiveness to those who have hurt me.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   "I am ready to understand that God has forgiven me
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   "for the hurts that I've done."
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And she got baptized in the very same water that she threw the rocks in.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   And that's not all.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Do you know what happened next?
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   The Lord began to heal her,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and He created a ministry
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   to those who've had abortions around her.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And that ministry grew,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   and today it's thousands of people,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   many of whom are listening to me right now.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   That's what God does
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   when you bring your hurts to Him.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Some of you, the hurt that you carry around
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   is that you look at where you're at,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   and you're like, "Hey, I don't even marriage.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   "I don't even have any prospects, and I want to get married to God.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   "Why have you forgotten me?"
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And you're sitting there, and you're drowning in the sea of singleness.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   You're drowning in the waters of singleness,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   and you're like, "God, why don't you throw me a life raft of marriage?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   "Throw me the life raft of marriage."
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And He's like,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   "'Cause you'll drown."
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   If I did, you'd sink.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   It's too heavy for you right now.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   You need to heal with the bitterness inside of you,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   and stop wearing these weights.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Stop wearing these weights,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   but check the baggage.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Check it.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I'm not saying--I want to be clear--
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   I'm not saying that once you deal with this,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   as soon as you deal with your baggage,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   God's going to send you someone.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   I'm not saying that.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   You may deal with your baggage, and you may walk outside and get hit by a meteor.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   I don't know, man. That may happen.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   You may get up to heaven and be like, "What was that all about?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   "If you wanted my attention, you could have just spoke to me or something.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   "You didn't have to send a meteor."
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   But I know what won't happen. You won't get up there and be like,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   "Hey, why wasn't I married?"
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   You'll be like, "Oh, wow.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   "What is marriage?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   "I'm married to the bridegroom of Jesus Christ
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   "for the rest of eternity."
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Nobody's married up there. I don't know if you knew that.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Nobody's married in heaven.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Scripture says that explicitly.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Someone who hasn't forgiven someone else is carrying around weight
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   that will expose itself in times of trouble.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Sometimes people say, "I can forgive others. I just can't forgive myself."
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   You're right. You can't forgive yourself.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   You didn't sin against yourself.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   You can't forgive yourself. You sinned against God.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Others will use that semantics, terminology.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   I don't have a problem with it, but I'll just let you know.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   You're not trying to forgive yourself.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   You're trying to receive the grace that God is freely extending to you right now
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   and understand that He's forgiven you
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   and that He's making you into something.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   He already sees the finished product.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   He loves it immensely.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Not some future version of you.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Not what you're becoming.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   He loves the finished product of what He's going to do in your life.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   He already sees it as such.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   "Do not lie," verse 9.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   "Do not lie to each other,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   "since you have taken off your old self with its practices
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   "and have put on the new self,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   "which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator."
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Since you have taken off your old self with its practices
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   and you've put on this new self,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   which is being renewed in the knowledge, the reality,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   renewing your mind, Romans 12, 1 and 2 says,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   around that there is a Creator
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   and that He's going to turn you.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   He's finishing a work that He started in you,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   making you into the image of Jesus Christ, His Son,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   perfected at glorification forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And He's not holding your abortion against you,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   your sex against you, your pornography against you,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   your alcoholism against you, your gambling against you,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   your hurts, your sexual abuse.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   That what you did, that's what was done to you.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   It's not being held against you.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   He's forgiving you for it.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   He's set you free from it.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   But you don't feel free because you're carrying that baggage.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   The last one, it's a big one.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Big baggage in marriage.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   It's unchecked lies.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Lies left unchecked will lead you astray.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Lies left unchecked lead you astray.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   See, you came in tonight and you have all of these preconceived notions
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   of what dating and marriage and sex and all of these things are,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   but they're not informed by the Scripture.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   They're informed by Cosmo, they're informed by TV,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   they're informed by movies, romantic comedies,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   they're informed by the Internet.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And so, can I just say, you're believing lies in this room.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   You have bought all of these lies that, hey, it's all about your happiness
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   and all of this craziness and eternity has zero implications
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   on what you believe about marriage and dating.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   You have to renew your mind.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   And so this is that baggage.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Like I said, it's a big one.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   The lies that we believe.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   These are the clothes that you bought because someone else convinced you
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   they were cool.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   My Yeezys, who knew?
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   How'd those get in there?
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Sorority shirt, Coyotes in the house.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Those things that you did because you wanted to fit in.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Clothes you wore because you wanted to fit in.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Clothes that culture said, hey, this is what the style is.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   This is where you need to go.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   You're being influenced by external influences.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Some of them are wrong and you've believed lies.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   And so what happens in marriage, have you ever done this?
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Have you ever got to the gate or the baggage check
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   and your bag has to be under 50 pounds?
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   That one, that's mine. It never is.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   You get up there and it's like 54 pounds and then you have to unzip it.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Has this ever happened to anybody?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   You have to unzip it and shuffle around.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   You do the shuffle.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   You're like, okay, here's my bottle of Don Julio tequila.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   That has to go somewhere else.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   We've got to move this around and put that there and this, that, whatever.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   And all you're doing, and this is what happens in marriage,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   is you begin to shuffle around the lies that you've believed
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   throughout the years.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Oh, what? We're not going to make love every single day of our lives?
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Marriage isn't all about that? What?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   You're not going to come to bed every night in lingerie? What?
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Oh, this really isn't about tips and tricks? What?
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   It's not about performance? What?
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Oh, we do that less than one half a percent of our lives? What?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Oh, God speaks into how many kids we should have?
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Those sorts of things? What?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Oh, community matter? What? Church membership? What?
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   And you begin to learn new things, renewing your mind
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   around what the Creator has for you.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Proverbs 4:23 says, "Above all else, guard your heart,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   for everything you do flows from it."
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Your version might say, "Keep your heart with all vigilance,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   for out of it everything in life flows."
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   What it's saying, friends, is that you've got to be careful
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   what you let in your heart, because what you put in your heart
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   takes you places.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And when you begin to inform your heart around what love is,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   what dating is, and what marriage is, and it's lies,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   you go into marriage, and every single person,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   every pre-married couple Monica and I have done pre-married counseling with,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   every single one of them have struggled with bad expectations.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And it's because the culture has fed their bad expectations.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   So we sit in our living room, we go through how awful their expectations are,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   they call me two months later and tell me that we were right,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   but they didn't believe us when we said that.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   And it's just these rose-colored glasses that we wear,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   or these terrible expectations that we have.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And so where does it come from? It can come from your friends.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Some of you, you came here by yourself because no one would come with you.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   "What? Aren't we going to church on Tuesday?"
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   No, no thanks.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And you realize you have no positive influences.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   You don't have community, you're not really a part of the church.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   You're sitting on the outside looking in,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   and you know that you keep going to the same places
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   hoping that something else happens.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   You return to the same sins like a dog to his vomit.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And it's because those around you are such strong influences on your life.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   And for you, my friends, what I would say to you is you need to change your playmates
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   and your playground.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   "What? You want me to just stop being friends with them?"
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I want you to stop being friends with them.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   "What do you mean?" Stop.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Talking, calling, going over, hanging out with.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   That feels unloving.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   It may be the most loving thing you can do.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Most God-honoring thing you can do.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   "I'm not going to go to the bar with you anymore.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   "I'm not going to do that anymore."
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   It can be your parents.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Your parents didn't make you a sinner, but they gave you some great sins to choose from.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   They passed their baggage on to you.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Some of you, your mother was a worrier.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Anybody's mom a worrier? Don't raise your hand. That wouldn't be loving.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   You go out with your friends, she's like, "Where are you going?
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   "Text me when you get there, text me when you get home."
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   "Who's driving? He's got a driver's license? What?"
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   She's out there with breathalyzer tests, you know, I mean, she's crazy.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Right?
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   And today that looks like, "Why aren't you married yet?
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   "Aren't there some good guys in that church?"
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Oh, man. Thanks, Mom, for that encouragement. Marriage motivator.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Just marry someone.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   As long as you're happy.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   And they tell you stupid things.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Like it's about your happiness.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Parents love to say that.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   It's not about your happiness. Life's not about you.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   You were put here by someone else, and life is all about him.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   You living for him.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Comes from magazines, lots of magazines.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Teach you tips and tricks you never see.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   I always walk through the grocery store aisle, I'm like, "Who buys these things?"
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   But evidently people do, because there's always new ones out there.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And they say the dumbest things. They never say, they never have said this,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   they never say, "Hey, here's how to be married for 60 years."
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   It's the headline that I've never seen. It's always, "Tips and tricks.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   "Here's how to get his attention." You know who reads that?
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Women who've been married six times read that.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   That's who read that.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   They're always trying to get his attention. It says dumb things like,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   "Seven tips to get her to orgasm."
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   And what, you know, it's the O word, I know.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   And here's what it does, and this is why I'm grieved for you.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   This is why I'm grieved for you, because I've talked to so many of you
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   who go into marriage with performance anxiety.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Because the culture has taught you,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   this is all about you working your moves.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Oh my goodness. Read the Bible.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Okay?
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Learn to pursue intimacy.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Learn to understand
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   from the one who created the act.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   I mean, those people
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   that are all about being great lovers
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   get divorced and remarried and divorced and remarried and divorced.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   And just in case, like you, the enemy's tempted,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   "Oh, well, he just, maybe he's got problems." No, listen.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Monica and I, no, we don't have problems in regards to that area.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Okay? Things are going quite well.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Listen, listen. But I will tell you this.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Listen. Back with me. But I took a lot of baggage
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   into marriage. I took a lot of
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   baggage into marriage. And it took
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   seasons of healing.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And it just gets better and better and better. My friend told me
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   so many of these young adults think the goody bag
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   is the word he used, happens on the honeymoon.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   He's been married for a long time. He says,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   "The goody bag happens in the 35 years of pursuing intimacy."
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   And it just gets better and better
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   and better. And we just don't think that way.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   We just don't understand
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   what God has desired for this. I want you to,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   I want you to understand a better way. We learn this
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   from movies and TV. You've never seen that show
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   that really gives you a biblical view of relationships.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Lots of worldly views, though.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   So I want you to think about where you're getting
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   relationship advice from.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   A guy tells me the other day,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   he was at a kid's birthday party.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   He's on his fourth wife. And he says, "JP, come here.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   I want to give you some relationship advice."
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   I said, "No thanks."
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   He said, "Well, I've had lots of practice."
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   I said, "That doesn't make you an expert, bro.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   I've got an expert.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   I've got community.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   No offense, but I don't want your relationship advice."
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   People write in all the time.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   They email and say, "Hey, JP, I just want your opinion
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   on something." No, you don't.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   You don't want my opinion. I hope you don't.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   I hope you want to understand.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   I mean, if you want me to clarify a verse or give you
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   what I think that means or send you some commentaries
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   or suggest some resources, but I'm not an advice column.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   I'm not here to give you my opinion on anything.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   I want you to know what God
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   desires for you from the instruction
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   that He's given us.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   We check our baggage
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   because it's cumbersome, it's reckless, it's hard to carry around.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   That's why we check it. We don't carry it with us on the plane.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   That's why we unpack it as soon as we get somewhere.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Could you imagine carrying all that stuff around all the time?
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   So application quickly. If you came in with addictions,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   you may need to trust in Christ that He's forgiven
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   your sins through His death and resurrection on the cross.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   That He's paid for it. He saw all the porn
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   that you saw in a moment when He paid for it.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   And it crushed Him. And it cost Him His life.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   He paid for everything
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   that you've done wrong. He paid for that abortion.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   It cost Him His life. But He did it because
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   He loves you. He's crazy about you. He did it to set you
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   free.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   You need to confess. Bring it to the light.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Stop hiding it. And you need to pursue recovery.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Man, if you're looking at porn,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   you shouldn't be dating. If you're having sex,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   the most loving thing that you may be able to do right now,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   the most loving thing you should do is break up.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Say, "Hey, we need to put the brakes on this.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Pull the parking brake. Take some time.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Pursue healing.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Get right with God. Understand what really matters in life.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   Stop training for adultery.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Stop training ourselves for sex
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   outside of marriage. I don't want to train myself to cheat on you anymore
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   by having sex with you outside of marriage."
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Some of you, what you need to do tonight is
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   go on your Outlook calendar, move forward six months
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   or a year, and just write in the subject line,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   "Date again." And between now and then,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   go into regen,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   go into biblical recovery,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   and heal. And it'll be the most loving thing
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   you could do for your spouse. If you came in angry from past hurts,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   pursue healing. Identify the source of those
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   hurts. We have all kinds. We have someone cares,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   shelter from the storm, men. If it's sexual abuse,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   we have people who are here that
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   what they do every day is they exist to help
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   you recover from that
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   in a godly way, be it an abortion, be it an abuse,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   whatever it is, but you've got
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   to bring it to the light. If it's parents,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   a relationship, you've got to forgive. That scripture
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   says, "Forgive as God also has forgiven you."
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Forgive. Some of you, what that means
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   is you need to leave here. You realize that you've been a part of
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   the hurts of someone else, and you need to go to them, if at all appropriate,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   and say, "Will you forgive me? When we dated,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   I took advantage of you, and I need to ask your forgiveness."
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Now, if they're married, I'd be wise. I would talk
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   about that in the context of your community. It may be a letter,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   it may be an email, it may not be appropriate.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   But some of you, you realize that the Rolodex
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   is going through your mind, and you need to leave here and seek people
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   out and say, "Will you forgive me? Because I look back and I realize
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   that I hurt you. I put weight
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   in your life."
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   It says, "Therefore, as God's
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourself,"
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   this is verse 12, "with compassion, kindness, humility,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   gentleness, and patience." Isn't that beautiful that Christ
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   gives us new clothes to wear? It's amazing.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   He gives us new clothes to wear. These clothes look good on everyone.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   They always fit. They're suitable for every
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   occasion. Humility. No one's ever worn humility
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   and looked bad in it. Humility looks
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   good on everyone. Gentleness looks good on everyone. Patience looks good
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   on everyone. Compassion and kindness. These are clothes
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   that look good on everyone. "Bear with each other and forgive
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   one another," he writes. "If any of you has a grievance
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   against someone, forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   And over all these virtues, put on love,"
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   the love we talked about last week. Adam did a great job
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   speaking of this love last week, "which binds them all together
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   in perfect unity."
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   And if you came in this evening believing lies, I want you
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   to cut off the source of those lies. You may need to leave
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   here and stop watching romantic comedies. Stop watching
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   that sitcom that is feeding your heart a
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   view of what marriage is.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   I said already, change your playmates in your playground. Cut off the TV
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   and open your Bible.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Friends, it's faithfulness in one direction.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Long obedience in the same direction. Okay?
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   You can trust in Christ tonight if you haven't,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   but sanctification is a process.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   And some of you, you need discipleship. You need
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   to sit down with someone and learn this
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   book and make the ingestion of these scriptures a daily
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   part of your life.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   For the rest of your life.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   That this would be a daily part of your
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   existence on this earth is knowing God's
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   will for you. And renewing
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   your mind and your heart around the Holy
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Scriptures. Following
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   His spirit over the advice of
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   Cosmo and Maxim and men's health.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Friends, you need more than just will and want.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Some of you are like, well, I want to
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   stop looking at porn. I want to forgive that person. You need
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   more than just will and want.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   You need a plan for recovery.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   You need discipleship.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   You need to plug into a healthy body of church.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   Begin to prioritize the things of Christ.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   And put on new clothes.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   We, Monica and I went back to
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   that resort for our 10 year anniversary. It was so amazing
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   to sit in that same place
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   10 years later and reflect on what God has done.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   I've told you before, even earlier tonight, almost got divorced
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   year two. And then God just began
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   to heal us in such a way that today we have this
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   incredible marriage. These three amazing kids. We get to
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   talk to people about marriage. Share our struggles and learnings with them.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   She's the most amazing wife
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   for me, I'll say. I love her so
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   much. And it was great to celebrate that
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   and specifically talk about the healing
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   that we encountered through Christ.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And on our way back from Mexico, celebrating
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   10 years of marriage, we got diverted from Dallas to Houston.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   We got to Houston about midnight. We sat on the tarmac
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   for a while. We eventually were able to deplane.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   And they had sent, at Houston Hobby, they had sent
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   customs home. And so we got stuck at
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   baggage claim. We're there at baggage claim
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   and they said, "We cannot let you into the country because we've sent customs
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   home." And we're just sitting there
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   with our baggage and we can't move forward.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   And this,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   after about an hour and a half, somebody called
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   a gentleman who was at home with his family,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   sleeping I imagine, and he drove back
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   to the airport and he let us in.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   He let us move forward. That's what Christ does.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Some of you here tonight, you feel
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   like you can't move forward with your baggage.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   You can't stop. You can't get out of that trap.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   You can't forgive. You don't know what to do.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   He came
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   to give you some new clothes.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   I got to tell you,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   the blood of Christ covers
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   your sins. He has a covering
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   for all this stuff.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   Oh, what's that doing in there?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Righteous clothes.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   He takes your baggage.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   He took it on Himself, guys.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   He came to give you
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   a new life to heal you.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Make you spotless.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   That's what He did.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   He set you free. The scripture, this in Colossians,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   it starts with this beautiful text. I'm just going to read it to you.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Verses 1-4 says, "Since then you have been raised
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   with Christ. Set your hearts on things above where Christ
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   on the things above, not on earthly things, for you died
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   and your life is now," listen, "your life is now hidden
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   with Christ in God. When Christ,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   who is your life, appears, you then also
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   appear with Him in glory." And isn't
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   it amazing that God sees not your
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   sin, but His payment.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   God sees not your sin,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   but His covering. God sees not
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   your baggage, but His righteousness.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   God sees not your life,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   but the perfect life of His Son.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   And He gives you an inheritance,
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   His glory, forever and ever
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   and ever and ever and ever
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   and a million years from now you're still
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   with Him. And nobody's up there living with the
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   regret of that abortion,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   the addiction, the drunkenness,
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   the pornography, the relationship that you
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   swore, completely coded, "There's no way I could
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   live without Him." He says, "Yes you can.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   You're my son, you're my daughter.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   I've come to give you
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   a new life.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   To give you life so that you might live it to the full.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   So you might live it with
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   me." And I'm just crazy
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   enough to think that in His
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   sovereignty and power that He would have you right now
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   here listening to this
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   to remind you
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   that He's crazy about you.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   He's in love with you.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   That He forgives you.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   He's gone to incredible, great
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   lengths to forgive you, but you've got to move past
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   yourself and begin to live your
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   life for Him.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   Every day for Him.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   Faithfulness, long
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   obedience in the same direction.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   Discipleship, recovery.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   And begin to work on your marriage.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   That may happen even 10 years from now.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   You can work on it now as you
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   work on you and surrender to Christ
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   to make His work for you.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   So I'm going to pray that you would do that.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   And we're going to worship.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Christ, you said
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   verse 13 that we've been forgiven.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   You said over and over
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   and over that that's not who we are.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   We're not those things.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   That we've been made perfect in your image.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Would you help us to see ourselves
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   as you see us?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   Thank you for forgiveness through the cross.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Thank you for new life,
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   new creation that is no longer us who live
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   in the flesh, but your spirit
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   that lives in us, perfecting us,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   making us new.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Father, thank you that we can bring our
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   baggage to the altar, that we can
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   check it there, and that we can move forward
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   as your sons and your daughters.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   Is how the enemy lies to us
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   and says that
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   like, "Hey, you can't be fun if you're a Christian.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   And you have to die to the excitement
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   of life. You have to settle for something
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   bland." I've met few people
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   who have partied
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   and engaged in debauchery
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   in the ways that I did.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   And I've found treasure, world.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   I've found
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   treasure. Today I bear my cross as I wait
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   for the crown, but I've got to tell you something.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   His burden is light. His yoke
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   is easy.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   He did the hard part for me.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   And like this weekend, there's going to be a thousand
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   people having a better
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   time than they've ever had at any club with any
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   bottle service or taking shots or doing
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   any strip club, anything.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   And I know this, I don't say that naively, I know
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   this because they come up to me and they're like, "Man, you wouldn't believe my story."
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   Yes, I would. You won't surprise me.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   No offense, I just hear it every day.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   I found life in Christ. He set me free.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   Hey, some of you need not
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   to leave. You need to find
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   somebody with a shirt with a yellow light bulb
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   on it, and you need to go up to them and say, "I need to talk to you.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   I need to confess my abortion
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   to you. I need to confess my addiction to pornography
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   to you. I need to confess that this week
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   I had sex with my boyfriend/girlfriend.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   I have a gambling addiction."
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   Whatever that is. Don't leave without telling somebody.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   And that's step one.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   But it's not the end. It's not the finish line.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   I want you to pursue recovery.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   You can show up here, this same room,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   Monday night at 630. It's not a room full
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   of weirdos. It's a room full of broken people.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   It's the healthiest place in our church.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   And say, "Hey, help me with recovery.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Come in with any addiction."
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   And they would love to do that.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   If you're looking for community, if you realize
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   you don't have that, tonight we have open community group.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Guys, you can walk down this hallway. And girls, you can walk down that
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   hallway, and there's a room full of people also looking
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   for community. And if you're here in college,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   we do have our college hangout on the second floor.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   And I'll just reiterate, if you're a freshman, don't be a fool.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Sign up for LaunchU. If we can help you do that, if money's the issue,
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   talk to us. But we want you out there.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   It's going to be amazing, and we've saved spots for you.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   So you need to do that tonight if you're waiting until last minute.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   Tonight's last minute. So make that happen.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   I love you guys. If we can serve you in any way, let us know.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Peace, love, and serve the Lord.
