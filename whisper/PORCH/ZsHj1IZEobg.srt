 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:19,520
 The Lord is my shepherd.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,480
 I shall not want.

6
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,640
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,400
 all the days of my life.

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,880
 And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:20,280
 What's up, Porch?

10
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,040
 How are we doing tonight?

11
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,320
 Hey, my name is Timothy Atik.

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,920
 And I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark

13
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,600
 on Sundays as well as Tuesdays here at the Porch.

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,800
 If this is your first time here or your last time here,

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,480
 I am glad that you made it.

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,600
 Welcome.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,200
 Want to just say hello to all of our Porch Live

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,880
 locations that are watching--

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
 Scottsdale, Tulsa, Des Moines.

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,360
 I know you guys are out there, and several others.

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,240
 And then I know that some of you are just

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
 watching individually from the comfort of your living room.

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,640
 Wherever you are in the nation or world,

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,200
 I'm glad that you are tuning in.

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,000
 I have three boys.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,400
 They are 13, 11, and 5.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,280
 Their names are Noah, Andrew, and Jake.

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,920
 And here's the reality.

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,160
 I delight in my boys.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,840
 I truly do.

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,600
 Like, I delight that they are my sons,

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,680
 and I get to be their dad.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
 There are things that they do that when they do them,

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,920
 it honestly, it melts me in some way.

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,040
 So for example, my five-year-old Jake,

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,560
 he jumps and skips everywhere.

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,600
 So you can be talking to him in the living room,

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,320
 and he'll just be sitting there going--

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,320
 and then he'll go into the kitchen like this

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,760
 to get a Rice Krispie treat.

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
 And I'm like, that's awesome.

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,120
 I can't do that.

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,520
 If I did that at work tomorrow, it

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,320
 would cause serious questions.

45
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,720
 But you can pull that off, and I respect that, and I love that.

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
 And then I picked him up the other day,

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,120
 and he just kind of buried his head on my shoulder.

48
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,040
 And it was the type of thing where I was like,

49
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,280
 I don't want this moment to end.

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,240
 You don't enjoy it nearly as much as I do,

51
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,880
 but I just delight in this moment.

52
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,120
 And then my 11-year-old Andrew, you really

53
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,960
 have to work on him to get him to laugh.

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,640
 But when you get him, he collapses on the floor.

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,240
 And it's the best thing, because sometimes he just--

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,360
 his life can feel heavy.

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,320
 And so when he laughs and just collapses on the ground,

58
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,040
 there's something inside of me that just explodes.

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,480
 It's amazing.

60
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,360
 And then my 13-year-old Noah, as someone

61
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,920
 who tells stories for a living, that guy can tell a story,

62
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
 and he can build it to a climax, and he

63
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,840
 can deliver a punch in a way that I am

64
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,880
 like slapping the table laughing.

65
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,760
 And I love that.

66
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,840
 Like, I delight in my son so much.

67
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,280
 And yet, as I was preparing for this message,

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,440
 here's the thought that I had.

69
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,800
 I hope they know that.

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,400
 Like, I hope that my boys know just how much I delight in them.

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,960
 And as I had that realization as a dad to my three boys,

72
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,000
 I kind of felt like my heart was syncing up

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,160
 with the heart of our Heavenly Father.

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,360
 And I just sensed that my Father in Heaven

75
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,080
 was looking at me saying, I hope you know that.

76
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,240
 I hope that you know just how much I delight in you.

77
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,760
 And so I just wonder, if you're here tonight

78
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,200
 and you consider yourself a follower of Jesus Christ,

79
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,180
 if you've put your trust in Jesus,

80
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,720
 you have surrendered your life to Him, you are following Him,

81
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,240
 that makes you a child of God.

82
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,600
 Can you just allow yourself to sync up

83
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,720
 with the heart of your Heavenly Father tonight

84
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,600
 and sense Him speaking into your life to you tonight,

85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,640
 declaring, I delight in you?

86
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,680
 And the reality is some of you hear that and you don't believe

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
 it.

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,240
 And that's a problem.

89
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,320
 And we're going to deal with it tonight.

90
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,640
 We've been in a series just walking verse by verse,

91
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,680
 six weeks, five weeks, through Psalm 23.

92
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,180
 If this is your first week here, I'd

93
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,040
 encourage you to go back and just jump into the series

94
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,360
 and get caught up.

95
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,720
 But tonight we are ending by talking about the favor of God.

96
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,120
 How do you define the favor of God?

97
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,920
 Or what is favor?

98
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,320
 The best definition I've found for favor

99
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,600
 is demonstrated delight.

100
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
 It is delight that is demonstrated.

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,000
 So if favor is demonstrated delight,

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,560
 then the question that I have to ask myself as a dad

103
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,280
 to my three sons is, have I shown them my favor?

104
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
 But that's the wrong question when

105
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,560
 we're talking about our perfect Heavenly Father.

106
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,360
 The question isn't, has He shown His favor?

107
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,920
 The question is, have we seen His favor?

108
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,140
 Because God is showing His favor.

109
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,600
 The question is, do we have the spiritual sight

110
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,520
 to actually see it?

111
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,240
 And David, the guy who penned the most famous chapter

112
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,560
 in the entire Bible, Psalm 23, which we have now

113
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,520
 heard twice tonight, he had eyes to see it.

114
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
 And it's amazing.

115
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,280
 David is my favorite character in the Bible besides Jesus.

116
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,120
 Like, if you're just looking for a good book to read,

117
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,240
 like you want to read a novel that is actually true,

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,040
 just open up your Bible to 1 Samuel 16

119
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,840
 and start reading all the way through 2 Samuel.

120
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,720
 You'll read through the life of David.

121
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
 It reads like a novel.

122
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,720
 And it's my favorite character in the Bible besides Jesus,

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,640
 because his life is so compelling.

124
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,240
 He had really high highs, like he

125
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,120
 conquered a giant with a sling and a stone.

126
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,560
 And then he had really low lows.

127
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,240
 He slept with another man's wife and basically committed murder.

128
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,720
 He lived on the run for about 15 years,

129
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,560
 because an outgoing king was trying to kill him.

130
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,600
 Four of his kids died prematurely.

131
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,000
 His daughter was raped.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,480
 His best friend was killed.

133
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,880
 Like, his life was full of ups and downs.

134
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
 And yet, as we look at the end of Psalm 23,

135
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,840
 what's he able to say?

136
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,800
 He's able to say, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow

137
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,400
 me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house

138
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,600
 of the Lord forever."

139
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,640
 Do you know what that is?

140
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,760
 That is spiritual sight.

141
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,720
 That is David being synced up with his heavenly Father,

142
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,880
 understanding and seeing God's favor upon his life,

143
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,080
 God's demonstrated delight.

144
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,560
 And I just want to invite you into that tonight.

145
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,840
 If you're a child of God, I want you leaving here certain

146
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,400
 of God's delight in you.

147
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,000
 And if you do not know Jesus Christ, I want you to know God's

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,640
 delight is on the table for you as well.

149
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,600
 So, if you have a Bible, I want to invite you to turn

150
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,680
 with me tonight to Psalm 23.

151
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,120
 Psalm 23 is where we're going to be.

152
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,880
 And as we look at just this one verse, there's two things that

153
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,560
 I want you to see about God's favor.

154
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,920
 This verse is going to unpack two things for us, and here it is.

155
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,000
 First, we're going to see that God's favor is revealed.

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Remember, we want to see God's favor.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,440
 So, revealed, it's just a word of sight that God is showing

158
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,520
 his favor to us.

159
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,280
 God's favor is revealed in his pursuit of us.

160
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:01,240
 In number two, God's favor is revealed in his presence with us.

161
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,360
 So, first, I just want you to see that God's favor is revealed

162
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,040
 in his pursuit of us.

163
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,680
 What does David say in verse 6?

164
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,760
 He says, "Surely."

165
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,240
 Surely, that word in the Hebrew, and when I say in the Hebrew,

166
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,080
 that's just...

167
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,720
 I say that simply because that's the language that the Old Testament

168
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,400
 was originally written in.

169
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,800
 So, English is a translation of the Hebrew, but if you were to go and study

170
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,600
 the Hebrew, that word "surely," it's the equivalent of "certainly."

171
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,560
 There is confident expectation in it.

172
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,560
 David says, "Certainly, surely, goodness and mercy," we'll get to those

173
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:51,320
 in a minute, "they shall follow me all the days of my life."

174
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,080
 That idea of goodness and mercy following David, if you were to go look

175
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,120
 at the Hebrew about that word "follow," it's the equivalent of chasing someone

176
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
 or pursuing them.

177
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,320
 Like, if you were to go and read through the Old Testament and you were to look

178
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,560
 for all of the times that this Hebrew word is used, it is used primarily in regard

179
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,560
 to an enemy chasing or pursuing someone.

180
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,080
 So, how fitting is that that David was a guy who lived on the run for years?

181
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,280
 Why?

182
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,920
 Because he was being chased by enemies.

183
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,080
 And now, David is saying, "Look, even more than being chased down by someone

184
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,560
 who wanted to kill me, there's something else that is coming in hot behind me."

185
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,400
 And it is the goodness in the mercy of God.

186
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,160
 That's amazing.

187
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,280
 David is saying that one of the ways that the favor of God has been revealed in my

188
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:57,320
 life is that God is chasing me down with his goodness and mercy.

189
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,280
 And he tells us the frequency to God's pursuit of him with his goodness and

190
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,800
 mercy.

191
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,640
 What's the frequency?

192
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,160
 All the days of my life.

193
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,280
 On the day that David lost his best friend, on all of the four days that each

194
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,720
 of his four kids died prematurely, on the day that his daughter was raped,

195
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,880
 on the day that one of his sons tried to steal the throne from him,

196
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,240
 on the day that he committed murder, on the day that he committed adultery,

197
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,200
 on the day that he knocked out a giant, on all of those days,

198
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:45,800
 God's goodness in his mercy was chasing him down, which is amazing.

199
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,040
 I mean, do you believe that?

200
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
 Well, let's just talk about it.

201
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,200
 I mean, what do we mean when we say that the goodness of God is pursuing you every

202
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,000
 day of your life?

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,240
 What is the goodness of God?

204
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,880
 A.W. Tozer, who's a famous author and pastor who lived in the early to mid-1900s,

205
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,120
 he says this, "The goodness of God is the drive behind all the blessings He,"

206
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,600
 that's God, "He daily bestows upon us."

207
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:28,400
 So, it's awesome because A.W. Tozer is in total agreement with David because he

208
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,480
 says, "The goodness of God, it's the drive, it's the force,

209
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:42,120
 it's the horsepower behind all of the blessings that God daily bestows upon us."

210
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,760
 What's interesting is the word "goodness" that is used here is the same exact word

211
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,880
 that is used back in Genesis chapter 1 when God creates the heavens and the earth.

212
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,920
 If you were to go back and read the very first chapter of the Bible,

213
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,680
 what you would see is that God slips into this rhythm of creating where He speaks

214
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,920
 something into existence and then He steps back, He observes it,

215
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:14,480
 and He calls it good, which means that it's perfect.

216
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,400
 It is perfectly designed for humans to flourish.

217
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:28,960
 That same goodness, that same creative force that was in God when He spoke the

218
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,440
 heavens and the earth into being, that same force is what is behind God's

219
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,320
 goodness in your life.

220
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
 So, I just want you to think about this.

221
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,600
 If there was a book that chronicled every day of your life, then according to David

222
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,360
 here, on every single page of your life, it would read, "And God saw all that He did

223
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,760
 in your life that day, and it was good."

224
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,240
 God saw all the ways that He provided for you today.

225
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,040
 He saw all the ways that He protected you, all the ways that He led you,

226
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,080
 all the ways that He comforted you and strengthened you, all the ways that He

227
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:15,680
 sustained you and even disciplined you, and behold, it was good.

228
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,720
 Now, this is where, guys, I'm just going to be honest with you,

229
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,920
 this is where we have to have an honest conversation.

230
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:31,280
 Because the reason that people walk away from God, it really doesn't come down to

231
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,040
 they just stopped believing in God.

232
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,720
 You know what it comes down to?

233
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,600
 They stopped believing in the goodness of God.

234
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,320
 And I just want...

235
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
 I want to be very honest with you.

236
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,520
 I've shared in this series multiple times that 2022 was the hardest year of my life.

237
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,320
 And there were times during that year that I got frustrated with God, truly.

238
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,440
 And there were times where I questioned God's goodness.

239
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,400
 What's interesting is I sat with a group of people who have all been walking

240
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,200
 with God for decades.

241
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,240
 I just sat with them within the past week.

242
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,080
 And everyone was sharing about trials in their life.

243
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,640
 And I specifically remember one of those people who's been walking with the Lord

244
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:26,400
 for decades just saying, "I've struggled to believe that God is good even in the

245
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,680
 midst of this situation in my life."

246
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,800
 That's a real deal.

247
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,520
 That's a real struggle.

248
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,000
 Why?

249
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:44,600
 Because we equate God's goodness with material blessing and ease and comfort.

250
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,120
 So if life is tough and things don't go well, then we begin to question that God

251
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,680
 is good.

252
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,880
 So this is where we just have to...we have to make a decision.

253
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,640
 Can God still be good and your life be falling apart?

254
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,800
 Is that possible?

255
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,320
 And where I've landed is that God's goodness sometimes shows up in the form

256
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,400
 of material blessing.

257
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:17,520
 It sometimes shows up in the form of ease and everything is as it should be.

258
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,280
 Like, when I met my wife, God is good.

259
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,680
 When we had each of our three kids, God is good.

260
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,520
 When I got a new job, God is good.

261
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:37,600
 And yet God's goodness doesn't always come in the form of material blessing.

262
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:48,080
 Sometimes God's goodness comes in the form of Him holding you up and sustaining you

263
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,080
 in the midst of a raging storm in life.

264
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:59,040
 Like, sometimes God's goodness is just the fact that you are still standing,

265
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,200
 even though you're barely standing, the fact that you're still here,

266
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,200
 the fact that you're still hanging on, the fact that you chose to live another

267
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,880
 day, that is all a display of God's goodness in your life.

268
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:23,800
 And so even today, like, I stood down there, I needed worship tonight so much

269
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
 because you know what those songs forced me to do?

270
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,440
 They forced me to declare, they forced me to make a decision.

271
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,360
 That even when there have been things this week that have not gone how I wanted

272
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,600
 them to go and I had to make a decision tonight, is God good even in the midst

273
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,680
 of things not going how I want them to go?

274
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,320
 And I was able to worship with complete confidence, "Yes, God,

275
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:55,120
 you are good because I'm still here, I'm still standing."

276
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,520
 And so you just have to make a choice, you have to make a decision.

277
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,080
 Is God good or not?

278
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,560
 My encouragement to you is even in the toughest times in life, be faithful.

279
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:09,880
 Why?

280
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,640
 Because I promise you a day is going to come where you are going

281
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
 to get perspective.

282
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,480
 There's a character in the Old Testament.

283
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,120
 And if you're not familiar with the Bible and you're like,

284
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,080
 "What is the Old Testament?"

285
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,480
 It's basically the first two-thirds of the Bible.

286
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,560
 So if you were to go back and look at the beginning, there's a guy named Joseph who

287
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,720
 had a miserable life.

288
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,240
 You're like, "Well, how miserable could it be?"

289
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,560
 Well, his brothers took him, threw him into a well, and then pulled him

290
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,080
 out of it and sold him into slavery.

291
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
 That's a bad life.

292
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,760
 When he was sold into slavery, things began to turn around for him.

293
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,280
 And then he got thrown into prison because he was wrongfully accused.

294
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,160
 So he spent two years in prison.

295
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,160
 That's a bad deal.

296
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,400
 Later, a couple of decades later, he's reunited with the brothers that threw him

297
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
 or sold him into slavery.

298
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,440
 And listen to the perspective that this guy has.

299
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,360
 This is in Genesis 50, verse 20.

300
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,640
 He says, "As for you," talking to his brothers, "you meant evil against me,

301
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,200
 but God meant it for good."

302
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
 Why?

303
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,760
 To bring about that many people should be kept alive as they are today.

304
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,680
 See, here's the reality.

305
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,800
 He was sold into slavery.

306
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,880
 He was taken into Egypt.

307
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
 And you know what happened?

308
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,760
 God's favor was upon Joseph in such a way that even when he was in prison,

309
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,440
 he got called out of prison and then promoted to being the number two person

310
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,840
 in the nation of Egypt.

311
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,480
 And he led the country through a severe famine, and he was able to provide for his

312
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,000
 brothers who desperately needed food.

313
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,840
 So he gets this perspective of like, "You know what?

314
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,200
 You meant it as evil against me.

315
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,000
 But now I see that when I was thrown into that well, and then you sold me

316
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,880
 into slavery, and then I was put in prison, it was all the goodness of God."

317
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,440
 There's been times over the 13 years that Cat and I have been parents that we've

318
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,480
 made the poor choice to try and fly with small children.

319
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,840
 And if you get married and have kids one day, just email me after you fly with them

320
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,720
 for the first time.

321
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,520
 All you have to say is, "Totally get it."

322
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,480
 Because here's the deal, when you fly with small kids, they either make you look

323
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,360
 like incredible parents or like buffoons.

324
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,040
 Like, it's one or the other.

325
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,560
 You either look like a terrible parent or you look amazing.

326
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,720
 It's always a coin toss.

327
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,760
 The kid has complete control over you.

328
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,320
 When you get onto that airplane, that kid is like, "Excellent."

329
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,880
 Like when they say, "The doors are shut.

330
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,760
 We're ready for takeoff."

331
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,880
 They're like, "That's all I needed to hear."

332
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,360
 And then they lose their ever-loving mind.

333
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,360
 But here's...I still remember.

334
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,000
 This was a few years back.

335
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,800
 My five-year-old Jake, he was about a year and a half old at the time we were

336
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,520
 flying from Colorado to Dallas.

337
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,800
 Just in the middle of the flight.

338
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,440
 We're about an hour in.

339
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,840
 He just gets up to the best of his ability to communicate.

340
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,640
 What he is communicating to me is, "I'm ready to get off this plane now."

341
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,280
 Like, up to this point, it's been great.

342
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,440
 Takeoff was exhilarating.

343
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,880
 All of the ways you've tried to distract me with screens and stickers, I applaud you,

344
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,360
 Dad, for all of your effort.

345
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,880
 But now, I've had enough.

346
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,160
 We just need to walk down this aisle and we need to get off this plane.

347
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,120
 It's very hard to reason with a one-and-a-half-year-old.

348
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,560
 It's very hard to help them understand, "Hey, dude, if they opened up that door

349
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:54,040
 right now and we stepped off this plane, we wouldn't be where you think we would be."

350
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,760
 See, the reality is that is how we are in life sometimes.

351
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,240
 Sometimes, because of our limited perspective, just like my son Jake,

352
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,040
 he had a limited perspective.

353
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,480
 We have a limited perspective and there's times in life where life gets turbulent and

354
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,480
 we just get to a point where we're like, "God, this has been good, but it's time

355
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,800
 to get off this flight.

356
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,480
 I'm ready to be done."

357
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,480
 But what we don't realize is if we stepped off that flight, then and there, we wouldn't

358
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,800
 be where we think we want to be.

359
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,840
 The reality is just like on that flight, we had a captain, we had a pilot who knew

360
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,160
 the destination we were headed.

361
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,920
 He knew that even amidst all the turbulence we were experiencing, he was taking us to

362
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,960
 the place that we ultimately wanted to be.

363
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,480
 The same is true with God.

364
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,880
 We have a limited perspective and yet we have a perfect captain, pilot, who knows where

365
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,400
 he's taking us.

366
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,080
 Even in the midst of all the turbulence, even in the midst of everything that we look at

367
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,520
 and say, "Clearly, this is not good," God can look and say, "I know where I'm

368
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,800
 taking you and honestly, if you could see what I see, you wouldn't change a thing."

369
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,120
 And so it's just good for us to realize we cannot see what he sees.

370
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,000
 He is good.

371
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,560
 Surely goodness will follow us all the days of our lives.

372
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,340
 You know what I love about Psalm 23?

373
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:40,240
 If you were to go and you were to look at the verbs in Psalm 23, you would see, "The

374
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,080
 Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

375
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,820
 He leads me beside quiet waters.

376
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,360
 He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake."

377
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,640
 So the picture in the first half of the Psalm is God is going before me.

378
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
 He's leading me.

379
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
 He's leading me.

380
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
 He's leading me.

381
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,520
 And then you get to the end and what does David say?

382
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,160
 "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me."

383
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,440
 So God isn't just leading, he's actually following.

384
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,640
 He's going before you and he's coming behind you because he cares about you.

385
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
 You know what that is?

386
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,840
 That is demonstrated delight.

387
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,960
 It's the favor of God.

388
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:26,080
 But David goes on and says, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of

389
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,680
 my life."

390
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:35,880
 Mercy in the Hebrew, the original language that it was written in, it's the word hesed.

391
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,760
 Hesed speaks of the steadfast love of God.

392
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,580
 There's an author, his name's Paul Miller.

393
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,760
 He wrote an entire book, it's just called A Loving Wife.

394
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:56,000
 It is a book devoted solely to the one word hesed, unpacking the idea of hesed love.

395
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,200
 And this is how he explains hesed love, which has been translated as mercy here in Psalm

396
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
 23.

397
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,920
 Some translations translate it as loving kindness.

398
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,960
 He explains hesed love as one way love.

399
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,000
 It's a combination of commitment and sacrifice.

400
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,600
 I love this.

401
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,020
 It's love without an exit strategy.

402
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,760
 You bind yourself to the object of your love no matter their response.

403
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,960
 Hesed love doesn't act on feelings, it acts on commitments.

404
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,560
 It is a stubborn love.

405
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,480
 I love that.

406
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:44,720
 So David is saying, "Look, I am certain that there is this stubborn love that is chasing

407
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,000
 me down relentlessly every single day of my life."

408
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,740
 Even on the day that he committed adultery.

409
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,800
 Even on the days that he was leading his country through a multiple year famine.

410
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:07,420
 That stubborn love, that love without an exit strategy was on his tail.

411
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:15,020
 As I was preparing for this message, I realized that I was prepping to teach something that

412
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:20,380
 I wasn't applying in my own life.

413
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:33,420
 And as I just sat there and I thought about God's stubborn love for me, it overwhelmed

414
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:43,240
 me just thinking, "God, you have never given up on me.

415
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,940
 You've never even come close to giving up on me."

416
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,840
 And you're like, "Well, you're a pastor.

417
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,880
 You're like one of those professional Christians.

418
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,740
 You get paid to do this.

419
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
 Clearly you do it right."

420
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,120
 No.

421
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:05,480
 Like, let me just tell you the thoughts that went through my mind after all the days that

422
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,260
 I, a pastor, have ignored God.

423
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,660
 After all the self-sufficiency.

424
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,780
 After all the times that I've prioritized other things above God.

425
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,440
 After all the careless and hurtful words that I've spoken towards others, or the bitterness

426
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:30,320
 that I've harbored in my heart, or the gluttony, or the lust, or the pride, the manipulation

427
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:41,680
 of others, the selfishness, the attempts to use God for my own glory, not once has he

428
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:51,280
 even come close to giving up on me, and not once has he withheld his love from me.

429
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,560
 Not once.

430
00:27:52,560 --> 00:28:02,920
 Instead, he has been relentlessly chasing me down with his hesed love.

431
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,160
 So I just want you to know that that is true of you too tonight.

432
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,080
 Like, I don't know what you think when I say all that.

433
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:16,120
 I don't know if you, I don't know if you will just allow the truth of God's Word to cut

434
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,760
 through all of the lies that your enemy is whispering into your ear when I say these

435
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,120
 things.

436
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,760
 Like that small voice in your mind that's like, "Yeah, but."

437
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,240
 I'm like, "It's chasing you down."

438
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,840
 He's like, "Yeah, it is, but not for you.

439
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,480
 For you would be able to experience, but you've failed and so you can't."

440
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:46,080
 Like, whatever that voice is, tell it to shut up, because the Word of God, it tells us,

441
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:54,240
 "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life."

442
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:04,640
 And so, I tell you that just to say, God's favor is revealed in his pursuit of us.

443
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,320
 And then number two, God's favor is revealed in his presence with us.

444
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,600
 Look at how David finishes.

445
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,480
 This is the finale to the psalm.

446
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,760
 He says, "I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

447
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,200
 You know, when we read that verse, what is our natural inclination?

448
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,920
 Our natural inclination is to think that David is talking about heaven, like eternity with

449
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
 God.

450
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,560
 But if you were to go and read the top commentators, the top academics, and what they think David

451
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,360
 is trying to convey, you know what they would say?

452
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,720
 And I agree with them.

453
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,360
 What they would say is that that is one application of what David is saying, but it isn't the

454
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,880
 immediate meaning or application.

455
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,800
 See, when David says, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord," what was the house of

456
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
 the Lord?

457
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,040
 Well, at David's time, it was the tabernacle, and then David's son Solomon would build the

458
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,360
 temple.

459
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,280
 The tabernacle, which became the temple, that was the house of God.

460
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:13,280
 It was the structure that was built in God's presence actually filled a room of the temple.

461
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,680
 And so the nation of Israel would come to the house or the temple of God to meet with

462
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,200
 God.

463
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,200
 So what David is saying, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever," that word

464
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,400
 forever, if you go and look at the original language, the Hebrew, it can also be translated

465
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,440
 for length of days.

466
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,000
 So David is saying, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord for the length of my days."

467
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,240
 So what's another way to translate what David is saying?

468
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:49,280
 He's simply saying, "I will enjoy access to the presence of God every day for the rest

469
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,960
 of my life."

470
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,560
 That's what he's saying.

471
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,240
 If you were to go and read the Bible from cover to cover, do you know what one theme

472
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,200
 you would see from start to finish?

473
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,640
 It's this, God is committed to being present with His people.

474
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,840
 So if you look at the beginning of the Bible, in the first two chapters, you know what you

475
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
 see?

476
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,100
 You see the first human beings, Adam and Eve, they actually like walk with God.

477
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,120
 They take walks with Him.

478
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,240
 And in the third chapter, you know what the greatest consequence is for the rebellion

479
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,800
 against God?

480
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,520
 They get removed from the tangible, visible presence of God.

481
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,960
 It's the greatest consequence they experienced.

482
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,640
 But God didn't leave His people to themselves.

483
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,960
 So He began to cultivate a nation, the nation of Israel.

484
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
 And what did He do?

485
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,080
 He had them build a tabernacle, which was a house.

486
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,640
 And when they built that tabernacle, what did God do?

487
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,340
 His presence filled a room in the temple.

488
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,320
 And when the nation of Israel was wandering through the wilderness, how did God lead them?

489
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,840
 He led them as a cloud during the day and as a pillar of fire at night, so that the

490
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,840
 nation of Israel could always look and say, "God is here."

491
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,960
 Jesus shows up in the New Testament.

492
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
 What is He called?

493
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,100
 Emmanuel, which means what?

494
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,800
 God with us.

495
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,360
 Jesus dies on a cross for your sins and mine.

496
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
 He's buried in a tomb.

497
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,680
 He rises from the dead.

498
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,820
 He ascends into heaven.

499
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,240
 He sits down at the right hand of the Father.

500
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,600
 And who does He send?

501
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,260
 He sends the Holy Spirit.

502
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,820
 What does the Holy Spirit do for every person who puts their trust in Christ?

503
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,780
 The Spirit of God indwells them, which means the Spirit of God, God Himself actually lives

504
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
 inside of you.

505
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,820
 If you were to fast forward to the second to last chapter in the entire Bible, Revelation

506
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,000
 21, do you know what it says?

507
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,660
 It says the dwelling place of God is with man.

508
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,760
 So from start to finish, what's the message?

509
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,580
 God is committed to being present with His people.

510
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,480
 David got that.

511
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,600
 He got that.

512
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,360
 So here's what I want you to think about.

513
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,920
 I just want you to think about this.

514
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,480
 God has been with you every single second today.

515
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,620
 Does that do anything to you?

516
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:25,680
 The God of the universe, when you woke up this morning, He was in your room.

517
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
 It's like, finally.

518
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,680
 Just get going.

519
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,900
 When you're eating breakfast, He's at the table.

520
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,480
 When you're working out, He is not working out.

521
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
 He's God.

522
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,960
 He's not talking to you, but He's still there.

523
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,760
 When you're sitting at your cubicle or wherever you sit, He is right there with you.

524
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,120
 When you were driving in your car, He was driving with you.

525
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,960
 And God's presence isn't passive.

526
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,560
 Like He is actually very involved in your life.

527
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,860
 He's strategically thinking about you.

528
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,040
 He is with you.

529
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,240
 He's listening for you to speak to Him.

530
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,280
 He's trying to communicate to you.

531
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,360
 He is present with you every single moment of every day.

532
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,460
 Our tendency is to believe the lie that God is only really present during the monumental

533
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,960
 times in our lives.

534
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,720
 You graduate college, man, God was there.

535
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
 You got your first job.

536
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,800
 Praise God, you were there.

537
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,960
 You think you meet your spouse.

538
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
 God is here.

539
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,480
 You get a ring on your finger.

540
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,680
 He's definitely here.

541
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,560
 He's only really there in the monumental times.

542
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,840
 And what David is reminding us, He's there in the monumental times, but He's also there

543
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,240
 in the mundane times.

544
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,880
 He's there every moment of every day.

545
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,680
 He's there in the highs and lows.

546
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,040
 Like He was there when I felt like I hit rock bottom in my sin right out of college.

547
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,680
 He was there when I started dating Kat.

548
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,800
 He was there when my friend passed away in Iraq.

549
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,960
 He was there when our son went into the NICU.

550
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,120
 He was there when we moved from Austin to Waco.

551
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,140
 And when we moved from Waco to College Station, He was there when we moved from College Station

552
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,000
 to Dallas.

553
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,480
 He was there when we had a miscarriage.

554
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:26,440
 He was there when we have navigated some serious challenges with one of our kids.

555
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,140
 And yet, here's my fear.

556
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,960
 I don't want to wait till I get to heaven to then get perspective and realize, "Oh,

557
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,960
 shoot.

558
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,600
 You weren't just there in the monumental times.

559
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:46,880
 You were there when I was sitting in my home office every single second of the pandemic.

560
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,200
 You were there every time I was binging Netflix.

561
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,160
 You were there every time I was driving in the car.

562
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,740
 You were there that one time I went for a run.

563
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,480
 You were there.

564
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,840
 Every single moment of every day, every time I had to make a decision, every time I felt

565
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:10,240
 down or alone, every time I didn't know what to do, every time I didn't know if I was going

566
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:17,120
 to make it another day, every time I wondered about my future, every time I stressed out,

567
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,880
 every time I felt like I was carrying too much, every time I felt laid down by life,

568
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,780
 every time I felt like a failure, every time I didn't feel like I was enough, every moment

569
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:33,240
 of laughter with my wife, every sweet moment with my kids, you were there."

570
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
 You know what that is?

571
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,040
 That's demonstrated delight.

572
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,160
 That's God's favor.

573
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,680
 Can you imagine how different your life would be if you woke up and realized, "God, you

574
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:48,960
 are here and I get to meet with you."

575
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,280
 You know what we're like?

576
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,320
 So I went to college at Texas A&M University.

577
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,500
 It's good to see you.

578
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
 And here's the deal.

579
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:06,240
 I would go to football games and the glorious Kyle Field holds 100,000 people.

580
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,880
 And what's crazy, I've maybe shared this with you before, but people will actually bring

581
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:16,100
 their infants, their kids to football games at Kyle Field, which is crazy.

582
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:25,380
 And people can be yelling like crazy, and besides last year, all the years around it,

583
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:33,460
 like you can see some amazing displays of greatness, empower.

584
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,380
 And there are babies who can sleep through all of it.

585
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,760
 It's crazy.

586
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,640
 And yet that's what we often do every single day.

587
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:52,340
 God is with us and He is putting His goodness and His greatness, His power on display.

588
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,020
 And we are sleeping like babies to His presence.

589
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,900
 Like I want to live awake.

590
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,860
 Like I don't want to wake up and believe that God is only there for the 30 minutes that

591
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,860
 I'm at home with my Bible open.

592
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,600
 Like when I shut my Bible and say, "Amen," God's like, "Great, let's go."

593
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,020
 And He's leaving with me.

594
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,660
 And He's going to be there every second of every day.

595
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:23,540
 So I want to live awake to His favor in my life.

596
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,100
 It's demonstrated delight.

597
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:32,180
 God's favor is revealed in His pursuit of us, and His favor is revealed in His presence

598
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,180
 with us.

599
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,180
 So what do we do with this?

600
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,900
 Here's what I want you to know.

601
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:41,100
 There's an invitation on the table tonight for every single person in this room.

602
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,620
 Every person in this room, and I hope you don't miss the invitation.

603
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,540
 Because every invitation deserves a response.

604
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,500
 If you're here tonight and you have a personal relationship with Jesus, here's what I mean

605
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
 by that.

606
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,420
 I mean you have come to a place where you have recognized your desperate need for a

607
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,500
 Savior from your rebellion against God.

608
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,580
 And you have come to a place where you have spoken to Jesus Christ and you have told Him,

609
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:13,020
 "I desperately need your work on the cross to count for me."

610
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,420
 If you've made that decision, then the invitation to you tonight is just recognition.

611
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:25,380
 It's an invitation to recognition that you would recognize tonight God's pursuit of you.

612
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,060
 That every single day He's chasing you down with His goodness.

613
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,540
 Even if today is a day where you have questioned whether you even want to live, you need to

614
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,900
 know His goodness is chasing you down.

615
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,140
 His chesed love is chasing you down.

616
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,820
 Recognize that.

617
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,100
 Recognize that He's with you.

618
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:49,100
 Now don't leave this place until you do business with the Lord and just sit and allow His goodness

619
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,820
 and His love to spill into your life.

620
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,220
 It's an invitation to recognition.

621
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,900
 But if you're here tonight and you do not have a relationship with Jesus Christ, you

622
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,580
 are not a Christian.

623
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:08,620
 You have never truly understood why Jesus is important.

624
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,700
 It's an invitation to redemption.

625
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,660
 It's an invitation to redemption.

626
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,980
 See if you want to be able to confidently say, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow

627
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,100
 me all the days of my life," here's what you first have to realize.

628
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,700
 What you first have to realize is that goodness and mercy already went before you in the person

629
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,020
 of Jesus Christ to the cross.

630
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,980
 And when Jesus Christ hung on the cross, it was the greatest display of goodness that

631
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,440
 our world has ever seen.

632
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,100
 Because in that moment, God Himself left heaven and came to earth.

633
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:50,640
 He lived the perfect life that you and I could not live.

634
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,080
 And He substituted Himself in our place.

635
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,300
 He was punished so that we wouldn't have to be.

636
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,620
 That's His goodness.

637
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,300
 That's His chesed love.

638
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:09,340
 That's a stubborn love, that He would die for His enemies, and then He would rise from

639
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,580
 the dead, conquering our sin.

640
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,700
 If you don't know Jesus Christ, you can leave here tonight confidently saying, "Surely goodness

641
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,540
 and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life."

642
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,300
 But first you have to respond to an invitation to redemption.

643
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,140
 And it comes in realizing who Jesus is and what He's done, that He is the epitome of

644
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:36,020
 goodness and mercy that has gone to the cross for you.

645
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,940
 How will you respond tonight?

646
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:44,660
 "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell

647
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,740
 in the house of the Lord forever."

648
00:41:48,740 --> 00:42:05,180
 Let's pray together.

649
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,180
 I'm just going to ask, just with your eyes closed, I'm not looking to tweak anyone's

650
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,940
 emotions right now, I just want to ask, if you're here tonight, just with your eyes closed,

651
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,740
 if you want to say yes to Jesus, if you want to put your trust in Him tonight, if you want

652
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:25,340
 to begin a relationship with Jesus, then let me just ask you to put your hand up real quick

653
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,860
 so I know exactly who I'm talking to in this place.

654
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,700
 We can just have a quick conversation.

655
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
 That's awesome.

656
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
 That's great.

657
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,220
 If that's you, you can put your hands down.

658
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,780
 And here's what I want to invite you to do right now, just right where you are, just

659
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,100
 be very clear with God.

660
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:47,580
 There's no rabbit's foot prayer, but you can just tell Him, just say, "Lord Jesus, would

661
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:52,100
 you come into my life tonight?"

662
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:57,460
 Just tell Him, say, "Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.

663
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:03,380
 Thank you, Jesus, that you rose from the dead for me."

664
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,380
 Ask Him for forgiveness.

665
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,060
 "Lord Jesus, forgive me of my sins.

666
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,820
 I give my life to you tonight.

667
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,060
 Would you be my Savior?

668
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:26,340
 Would you lead me in a new life as my King?"

669
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:31,860
 If that's you, welcome to the family of God.

670
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:36,860
 And just for everyone in the room, this is a moment for you to do business with the Lord.

671
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:42,860
 Don't rush past the fact that God's goodness is here for you tonight, that He's present

672
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:49,460
 here right now, wants to meet with you, that His love for you is so stubborn that not even

673
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,500
 you can shake it.

674
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,460
 Would you just let Him speak to your heart?

675
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,260
 Would you just open up your life to Him right now?

676
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,480
 You can even put your hands out just as a demonstration that you are available to Him

677
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,340
 right now.

678
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,180
 Would you just ask Him to speak to you?

679
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,580
 Whatever He wants to say, just say, "God, I want to hear from you right now.

680
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,580
 Would you speak to me?

681
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:17,300
 Lord Jesus, you are a good King.

682
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,660
 You are good.

683
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,820
 I thank you for who you are and what you've done.

684
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,460
 I thank you for how much you love us.

685
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:30,220
 I pray your goodness and mercy that it would just feel like you are chasing us down and

686
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,580
 you have caught us and you're going to smother us with your goodness and mercy.

687
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,580
 I pray that for us right now.

688
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,700
 And I just pray that your presence would be very real to us now.

689
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,700
 We need you.

690
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,820
 We love you.

691
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,740
