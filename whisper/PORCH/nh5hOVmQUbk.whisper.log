[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:37.140]   - All right, Forge, how we doing?
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.900]   We doing okay?
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.740]   It's good to see you.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.180]   Welcome back, week two.
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.620]   It's been an amazing night already.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.840]   I'm really looking forward to where we're going
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.060]   this evening and I'm really glad you're here for it.
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.140]   Genuinely, I believe this every week
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.160]   and yet there's just something in my soul tonight
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.840]   that thinks God has something special in store.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.840]   Before we get going, it wouldn't be a typical Tuesday
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260]   or a regular night at the porch if we didn't say hey
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.640]   to some special friends that are tuning in with us online.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.020]   So, special shout out to all of our Porch Live locations
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.380]   that are tuning in with us wherever it is you are.
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.440]   Will y'all put your hands together for Porch Live?
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.740]   Yes, we love the Porch Live.
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.300]   Special shout out to Porch Live Wheaton,
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.420]   Fort Worth and Fresno.
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.040]   Man, I love the fact that God is not just doing
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.180]   something here, he is doing something in other places
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.780]   as well and we're a part of it.
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.620]   Like sometimes we can get trapped in our moment
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.560]   here in Dallas and think that God's really working here
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.820]   but what we need to know is, man,
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.940]   we're a part of a greater movement
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.400]   which is happening all over, I mean really,
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.100]   it's happening all over the world
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.040]   and it's an incredible gift that we get to be a part of.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.560]   So, love the fact that we're here,
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.260]   really excited for tonight but to set things up,
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260]   I'd love to just start with a quick story
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.680]   and I'd like to try and help out some of my brothers
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.920]   in the room and do you a solid in the event
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.880]   that no one ever has.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.900]   So, if you're a guy in the room,
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.820]   then I just wanna look at you and tell you straight up
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.920]   that the minute a woman enters your world,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.260]   it's going to fundamentally flip upside down.
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.820]   Like everything is going to change for you.
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.720]   I know this was my experience.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.020]   When Brooke and I got married, I was 25 years old,
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.240]   meaning that I had a quarter century of life
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.300]   under my belt by this point.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.820]   Like I felt pretty confident in my ability
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.480]   to navigate the ways of paying my bills
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.540]   and getting my groceries and providing for my needs.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.820]   I wasn't super settled in my ways but I was comfortable.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.020]   Like I felt really good, really confident
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.540]   about the way that I was walking through the world,
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.860]   navigating my reality.
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.300]   That is until we eventually moved in together.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.420]   You see, but before we did,
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.460]   Brooke and I, we went in and we got an apartment.
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.380]   She moved in first.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.220]   I waited until we said the I do's and then we came together
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.580]   but she moved in first because she wanted to nest.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.340]   You see, ladies like to take a house
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.780]   and make it into a home, which I was great with
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.580]   only until I realized that upon moving in,
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.540]   she wasn't just making a house into a home.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.980]   She was actually gonna take a simple man
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.380]   and make him into a family man.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.060]   Because when I moved in after we got married,
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.420]   what I learned is the dryer was not a suitable place
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.580]   to store my clothing.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.040]   Guys, anybody willing to admit that that's what you do?
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.020]   Like your clothes are sitting in the dryer in this moment.
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.860]   Don't do it.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.300]   It's not gonna work for her
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.980]   because she's gonna want it all folded and hung up
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.940]   and sorted appropriately.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.380]   I realized pretty early on
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.140]   that my meals couldn't simply consist of the chicken rice
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.080]   that I had prepped the week before.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.960]   Tupperware wasn't suitable serving where instead,
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.900]   we were gonna follow whatever recipe
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.300]   Half-Baked Harvest had recommended at that time.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.220]   I don't know about you, but I know for myself,
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.260]   my come and take it flag was sufficient decor
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.460]   to be pinned on my wall.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.180]   Any guys with some flags hung in their apartments
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.300]   or townhomes or bedrooms right now?
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.420]   It's not suitable decor.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.220]   Like when you get married and you move in,
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.080]   she's going to want to frame photographs and hang artwork
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.160]   because she is going to try to actually make you into more
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.860]   than you are right now.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.540]   She's going to want to make you into a family man.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.000]   You see, I felt like the minute she and I got married,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.100]   everything changed for me.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.260]   Like my whole way of thinking was confronted to the core.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.360]   My whole way of feeling was like called out and called up.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.300]   My way of doing was challenged forever.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.640]   Now, if you asked me, Kylan, do you regret it?
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.160]   I would say no.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.380]   I actually recommend marriage.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.460]   I think it's pretty great.
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.460]   You see, I realized that there were some old ways
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.920]   of doing things that I needed to unlearn.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.060]   And yet there were some new and better ways
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.100]   of doing things that I needed to learn instead.
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.180]   Now, why do I tell you all of that?
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.220]   Because some of you are here tonight,
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.500]   and if you're honest, you feel like this is your current
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.020]   state of circumstance.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.740]   Instead, you're not trying to figure out
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.800]   how you should behave at home.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.720]   You're trying to figure out what you should believe at heart.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.160]   Like some of us feel like our old way of doing things
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.120]   spiritually are no longer working.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.000]   And so we're wondering if there's a better way
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.360]   of doing things instead.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.680]   If that's you, then I'm really grateful you're here
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.180]   and excited to tell you that this series is meant for you.
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.480]   Because over the course of the next five weeks,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.160]   we want to help rebuild your spiritual reality.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.320]   Like we want to reboot your belief.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.240]   We want to help you reconstruct whatever it feels like
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.080]   is deconstructed.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.740]   And it's not because we're just trying to generate
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.760]   some clickbait, like pick a subject that's going to
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.680]   have a lot of hype.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.680]   It's really because we want to be helpful.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.580]   We want to be helpful.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.920]   We know that this idea of deconstruction
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.440]   is massively widespread within our generation.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.760]   So we want to attack it head on.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.080]   And yet in order for us to do that,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.700]   what we have to do is we have to set a really firm
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.000]   foundation because you can't construct something
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.600]   unless you have a good basis to build on.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.580]   It makes me think of several years ago
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.040]   when I was at the beach with my niece.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.840]   My niece, she wanted to build a sand castle,
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.800]   which I'm all about.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.840]   That sounds like a great time.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.600]   And so she pulls out her sand tools and her sand toys
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.720]   and her castle cups and we start packing sand
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.160]   in those things.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.320]   And she's turned them over and sets them down.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.960]   And what she realizes is every time she flips the cup,
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.800]   the structure's not standing.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.880]   Because she didn't know that she should clear the sand
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.000]   and level a foundation.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.240]   That's what we have to do.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.880]   Before we get into this idea of deconstructing
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.160]   and really evaluating how we rebuild our reality,
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.260]   we have to lay a good foundation to build on,
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.460]   which is what we're going to do here tonight.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.320]   So where do we start?
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.420]   What's the right place to begin
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.280]   in the work of rebuilding reality?
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.680]   I think we need to establish a really good working
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.480]   definition for deconstruction,
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.200]   because I don't know about you,
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.160]   but in my world, as I've done research,
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.560]   what I've found is people fall in all manner
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.120]   of different places when it comes to this topic.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.560]   You see, some people look at deconstruction
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.080]   and they treat it as more of an intellectual renovation
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.560]   of sorts, like you take one thing from your life
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.400]   and you're just trying to freshen it up a little bit.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.040]   Other people, they look at deconstruction
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.840]   and it's really synonymous with disenchantment.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.280]   Like I used to believe that,
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.060]   man, it's just not really working for me anymore.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.480]   While others look at deconstruction
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.560]   and they equate it to demolition.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.120]   That I'm not just trying to overhaul a couple of things
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.040]   with respect to my faith.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.560]   I'm trying to blow everything up with respect to my faith.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.220]   People, they fall all over the grid
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.560]   with respect to their understanding of deconstruction.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.400]   And I'm sure that's the case for some of us here tonight.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.180]   And the reason for that is because deconstruction
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.180]   is notoriously difficult to understand
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.960]   if you actually go back to its origin.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.920]   I don't know if you knew this,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.780]   but deconstruction is not a new thing.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.260]   It actually was created by a French philosopher
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.840]   named Jacques Derrida in the 1960s.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.620]   He was a young adult himself,
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.360]   and he created this concept
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.520]   that even he was unwilling to summarize
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.600]   when asked how to explain it
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.760]   because it is annoyingly nuanced.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.800]   Just take my word for it.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.120]   If you want more information,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.440]   you can come talk to me down to the front
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.520]   at the end of our service.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.320]   And yet, because we're going to be spending
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.480]   the next five weeks on this,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.360]   we need to come up with some kind of definition.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.700]   So I have done the hard work of figuring out a definition
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.540]   that will work for us.
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.080]   Are you ready for it?
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.200]   It's nothing original to me.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.360]   It was actually quoted by a guy named Brian Zand
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.920]   in his book, "When Everything Catches Fire."
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.040]   And this is what he said.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.880]   He said, "Deconstruction is a crisis of faith
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.020]   "that leads to either a reevaluation of Christianity
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.840]   "or sometimes a total abandonment of Christianity."
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.220]   Meaning the process of deconstruction
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.220]   doesn't begin with dismantling your belief.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.840]   The process of deconstruction
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.900]   begins with doubting your belief.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.300]   That's the precursor.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.220]   That's where things have to begin.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.900]   And the reality is most people that say,
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.180]   "I'm deconstructing,"
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.820]   they're really just wrestling with doubt.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.340]   And so that's what I want us to talk about tonight.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.220]   You see, often when we hear the idea of doubt,
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.640]   when it comes to the faith,
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.700]   we assume that means a really bad thing.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.180]   And yet, I actually think within doubt,
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.600]   there's a really great opportunity.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.580]   So let me explain it to you like this.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.440]   When Brooke and I were in the market to buy a house
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.720]   after first moving here to Dallas,
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.900]   we knew that we wanted to buy a place
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.940]   that needed some renovations.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.780]   We knew it.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.140]   We wanted to invest in a property, increase its value.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.620]   And so as we searched the market,
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.260]   we knew we need to find a place
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.300]   that is requiring some renovation.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.800]   Now, when we bought our house,
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.180]   the house we bought fit the bill.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.720]   It needed to be updated.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.380]   Do you think we walked in
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.660]   and just started swinging hammers all over the place?
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.980]   No, that would have been very bad
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.900]   because as we did a careful evaluation of the property,
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.520]   we realized, man, there are certain things here
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.460]   that are in great shape,
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.460]   but there are other things here that do require attention.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.180]   Upon inspection, there were certain things
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.680]   that inspired our confidence to leave them as is,
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.140]   but there were other things that upon inspection
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.500]   inspired our concern that needed to be addressed.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.220]   That's how we have to approach our faith.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.440]   We have to consider as we carefully evaluate
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.380]   what areas of our faith are great as they are.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.720]   We don't need to touch them in the slightest.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.020]   And yet what other areas may feel,
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:56.020]   may feel somewhat out of date behind the times
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.340]   as if we potentially outgrown them.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.820]   You see, the beautiful thing about doubt
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.000]   is it's not a sign that Christianity is flawed.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.680]   A doubt is a sign that our understanding
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.220]   of Christianity is flawed.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.060]   If you're here and you're wrestling with doubt,
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.380]   it's not an issue with Christ,
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.460]   it's an issue in your understanding of who Christ is,
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.180]   which is actually really encouraging news
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.180]   because it means that God, He is just as unsearchable,
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.700]   He is just as unfathomable,
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.700]   He is just as uncontainable as He claims He is, right?
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.060]   If God was actually able to be pinned down by you,
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.780]   the Almighty, when you were in your teenage years,
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.580]   is that a God worth following?
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.920]   No, like no one here is rocking Nike Elites
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.180]   and Sperry's tonight, I wouldn't guess.
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.300]   And the reason why is you've likely outgrown them.
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.700]   But with that said,
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.060]   does that mean that you've outgrown the need for shoes?
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.300]   No, I'd guess that your shoe game
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.000]   is at its very best right now.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.140]   The same has to happen when it comes to our faith.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.460]   We have to be willing to look at our doubts
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.020]   and not allow them to lead us further from God,
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.220]   but allow them to lead us further into God.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.700]   And so I'm really excited because some of you are here,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.500]   you're wrestling and yet God's like,
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.220]   "Oh baby, we're about to go deep.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.620]   "I'm about to take you to a new level of understanding.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.280]   "I'm about to take you to a new place of faith.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.700]   "I'm about to stir up something new in your spirit."
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.540]   Are you ready?
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.060]   That's what God wants to do.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.360]   That's his heart and I love the enthusiasm.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.740]   A.J. Swoboda in his book "After Doubt" said it like this.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.800]   He said, "There's often no greater act of faith
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   "in fidelity to God than bearing one's deepest held beliefs
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.380]   "to divine criticism so that God might be loved more."
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.540]   To put it simply, kicking the tires
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.620]   doesn't mean you hate the car.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.620]   You see, doubt, it's not the enemy of your affections
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.560]   for God.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.060]   Doubt is the opportunity to love God more,
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:13.340]   to find answers that not only satisfy your questions,
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.100]   but satisfy your souls.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.080]   That's what I wanna talk to you about tonight.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.700]   And in order for us to do it,
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.380]   we're gonna look at a passage in the gospel of Luke.
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.700]   So if you have a Bible, you can pull it out
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.540]   and turn with me to Luke chapter 24.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.020]   As you do that, I wanna set up some context,
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.180]   not just to fill the gap as you flip the pages,
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.580]   but to really set something up
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.780]   that I think will be helpful to you
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.780]   because this idea of deconstruction
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.020]   is not an idea that is new to Jesus.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.100]   It's something that he actually dealt with repeatedly
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.780]   over the course of his ministry.
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.580]   And he cared a great deal about
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.780]   because when we come to this passage in Luke chapter 24,
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.260]   what we need to know is Jesus is right on the heels
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.340]   of his resurrection, yet he has not yet gone to the father.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.020]   He has not yet ascended back to heaven.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.100]   And all throughout this 40 day window
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.040]   that he has between the resurrection and the ascension,
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.520]   Jesus keeps making special guest appearances
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.540]   all across the Holy land.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.740]   He makes cameos in the most unlikely of places
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.220]   because if you were him and I were him,
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.740]   what would we likely do?
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.540]   We'd probably show up and rebuke the religious elite.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.340]   Hey, you guys, what were you thinking?
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.740]   We would probably show up and we would confront the Romans.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.660]   You crucified me, man.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.780]   What were you thinking?
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.220]   Jesus doesn't do that.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.540]   He doesn't go to the religious elite.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.940]   He doesn't go to the Romans.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.380]   Instead, what Jesus does is he pursues the doubtful.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.740]   That's his mission in this 40 day window.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.740]   It's to restore the faith of the faint hearted.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.080]   He goes to Mary.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.620]   He comes to Thomas.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.980]   He restores Peter.
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.260]   He appears in the upper room.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.560]   And right here, he walks with two disciples
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.220]   down a road to Emmaus.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.900]   So it says this in Luke chapter 24.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.700]   We'll pick it up in verse 13.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:08.220]   That very day, two of them were going
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.440]   to a village named Emmaus,
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.860]   about seven miles from Jerusalem.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.300]   And they were talking with each other
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.780]   about all these things that had happened.
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.740]   While they were talking and discussing together,
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.820]   Jesus himself drew near and he went with them.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.180]   But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.340]   And he said to them,
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.620]   what is this conversation that you're having
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.300]   or that you're holding with each other as you walk?
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.740]   And they stood still looking sad.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.980]   Then one of them named Cleopas answered him,
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.660]   are you the only visitor to Jerusalem
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.700]   who does not know the things
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.540]   that have happened here in these days?
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.260]   And he said to them, what things?
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.740]   And they said to him, concerning Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.020]   a man who was a prophet, mighty indeed,
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.780]   and word before God and all the people,
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.300]   and how our chief priests and rulers
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.140]   delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified him.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.500]   But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.020]   Yes, and besides all this,
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.060]   it's now the third day since these things have happened.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.300]   That comment at the end, it's now the third day,
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.700]   it means that they're at a moment of incredible discouragement
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.380]   because it was the point at which the Jewish mind
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.760]   thought that the soul would leave the body upon death.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.600]   Day three.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.660]   So it's interesting.
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.700]   Whenever you read the resurrection appearances of Jesus
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.120]   at the end of the gospels,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.620]   what you find is he not only repeatedly appears to people,
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.180]   but he constantly conceals his identity.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.660]   He's got a flair for the dramatic.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.500]   He likes a grand entrance.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.100]   We find that three different times,
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.140]   he conceals his identity.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.620]   He comes to Mary and he presents himself as a gardener.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.300]   He comes to Peter and the seven disciples,
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.020]   and he looks like a man sitting on shore beside the fire.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.020]   And then in this moment,
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.260]   he looks like a fellow wanderer
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.500]   to both Cleopas and his companion on the road to Emmaus,
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.820]   which begs the question, why?
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.700]   Why does Jesus conceal his identity in these moments?
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.740]   Well, scholars, they have a variety of different answers
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.980]   that no one knows for sure.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.620]   Some scholars look at it and they say,
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.940]   this is going to be the method of Jesus's primary ministry
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.900]   once he ascends to heaven.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.060]   It's going to be communicated through common men.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.140]   And so he wants to be a common man
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.700]   that is communicating to other common men.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.860]   That's why he conceals his identity.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.060]   Other people look at it and say,
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.500]   it's because of the disbelief of those
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.380]   that he's appearing to.
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.420]   He's looking at them and they cannot see him for who he is
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.940]   because they don't believe completely.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.820]   Others say that he is supernaturally concealing his identity.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.720]   He's throwing up a spiritual mask
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.020]   to conceal himself from these others.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.980]   Others look at him and say,
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.420]   it's just a physical obstruction.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.320]   He's too far away.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.140]   They can't make out the details of his face.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.040]   We don't know why he conceals his identity ultimately.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.460]   And yet, as I peeled through these pages
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.780]   and poured over and study,
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.220]   I think I arrived at a hunch that's pretty unique.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.220]   I think that Jesus conceals his identity repeatedly
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.060]   in these moments because he wants to,
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.780]   he wants to engage with people
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.680]   at the level of their rawest emotion.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.540]   Like that's what you see.
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.820]   Like Jesus conceals his identity and he comes to Mary
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.340]   and what he sees is that she's sorrowful.
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.880]   He conceals his identity and he comes to Peter
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.240]   and he sees that he's shameful.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.480]   He conceals his identity and he comes to these two guys
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.680]   and he sees that they're disappointed.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.140]   By way of him hiding who he is,
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.660]   we can actually see who they are.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.480]   He wants to engage people at an emotional level.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.320]   So much so that it says in this passage
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.720]   that they stood still looking sad
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.040]   because they had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.720]   And yet, because he did live up to that expectation,
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.600]   according to their estimation,
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.880]   they are walking away from him entirely.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:47.560]   Their doubt has descended to such a place
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.920]   that they're bailing on this whole way of Christ altogether.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.920]   And yet Jesus comes to them and he reveals to us
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.060]   the very first thing he does is he restores the doubtful.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.400]   Jesus walks with those who are walking away.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.560]   Jesus walks with those who are walking away.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.880]   That's the first way he pursues those downcast in doubt.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.800]   These guys are sad, they're disappointed.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.640]   They're probably headed to Emmaus
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.760]   for a little bit of self-care.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.800]   The city was known for being a place of natural hot springs.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.120]   And so they think that's probably nice
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   after everything that they've lived through.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.740]   And yet what we know is because they're on the way to Emmaus,
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.880]   they are not huddled with the other disciples
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.960]   in the upper room.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.320]   They're not gathered with the women by the tomb.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.320]   They're not even hiding in Jerusalem
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.720]   or waiting for some new development in the story.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.680]   No, they have given up.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.520]   They are walking away.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.140]   They have chosen to move on with their life.
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.540]   And while it would be easy for us on this side of the cross
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.040]   to look at them and shake our head and wag our finger,
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.200]   how dare you guys?
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.160]   We do this ourselves.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.080]   We walk away from Jesus for all sorts of different reasons,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.560]   even good reasons.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.840]   Like some of us, we walk away from the faith
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.380]   because we've been hurt by the church.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.160]   Others of us walk away because we've been slandered
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.520]   and belittled by other Christians.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.840]   We walk away from the church because we look at the pulpit
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.200]   and think it's become a place of political theater
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.080]   over the course of the last two election cycles
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.900]   and eight years altogether.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.640]   We walk away from the church because God claims to be good
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.040]   and yet he let me down.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.920]   He didn't show up when I needed him most.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.900]   We walk away from the church
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.880]   because there are other truth claims out there
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.280]   that seem to make better sense of my reality,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.940]   that seem to help explain my experience.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.280]   Like we all have our reasons for walking away,
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.200]   even good reasons for doing so.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.160]   And yet Jesus is anything but reasonable.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.680]   He's anything but reasonable.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.360]   That's what Paul says in Romans chapter five.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.400]   He says, "For while we were still weak,
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.380]   "at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.260]   "For one will scarcely die for a righteous person,
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.240]   "though perhaps for a good person, one would dare to die."
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.220]   Do you see, do you hear Paul reasoning?
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.840]   But God shows his love for us
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.640]   in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.960]   He does the most unreasonable thing.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.040]   Like he loves his enemies and he forgives his adversaries
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.680]   and he gives of himself without any expectation
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.960]   of anything in return.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.680]   He dies a death he does not deserve.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.160]   He rises from the grave.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.400]   Who does that?
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.980]   He tells us, "Hey, seek after me,"
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.140]   when none of us are worthy of seeking after him.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.580]   And ultimately he walks with us when we walk away from him.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.740]   This is who our Jesus is.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.520]   So let me ask you, if you're here tonight
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.360]   and you're doubting Jesus, then what are you walking towards?
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.740]   Like they're not just walking away from Jerusalem
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.340]   and all the doubt and all the disappointment
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.820]   that was there behind them.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.140]   They are actually walking towards Emmaus.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.600]   So it begs the question for us,
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.780]   where is it that we're walking?
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:56.860]   Where are you going?
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.820]   Are you walking towards romance?
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:04.020]   Are you walking towards success or comfort,
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.700]   power, approval, money?
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.500]   Like what is it that you're walking towards?
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.220]   And I don't ask you that because I want to shame you
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.620]   with respect to where you're walking.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.860]   I ask you that because wherever it is you're walking,
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.120]   there it is that Jesus is going to find you.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.560]   He meets them on this road and he will meet you
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.940]   on whatever road it is you're walking.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.460]   Not because he wants you to get there,
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.020]   but because he wants to get you back to him.
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.940]   That's what he's gonna do.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.580]   He walks with those who are walking away.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.980]   But it's not just that.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.860]   He's good company.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.600]   He talks along the way as well,
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.180]   which is what we read if we keep going.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.540]   It says in verse 22 through 27,
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.100]   "Moreover, some women of our company, they amazed us.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.600]   "They were at the tomb early in the morning,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.780]   "and when they did not find his body,
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.220]   "they came back saying that they had even seen
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.360]   "a vision of angels who said that he was alive.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.520]   "Some of those who were with us went to the tomb,
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.840]   "and they found it just as the women had said,
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.120]   "but him they did not see.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.140]   "He said to them," talking about Jesus,
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.780]   "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.600]   "all that the prophets have spoken.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.140]   "Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.360]   "these things and enter into his glory?
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.040]   "And beginning with Moses and all the prophets,
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.300]   "he interpreted to them in all the scriptures
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.980]   "the things concerning himself."
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:29.220]   When Jesus happens upon these two disciples,
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.820]   it says in verse 15 that he sees them
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.460]   talking and discussing, which to us,
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.220]   as we read it in English, just feels like
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.380]   they're a couple of chatty Cathy's.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.900]   Like it just feels like these are synonymous verbs
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.900]   that describe the fact that they are really
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.380]   in some sort of intense dialogue,
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.500]   and yet when you go and you read it
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.300]   in the original language, you see that they are talking
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.020]   and they're debating.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.180]   That's what they're doing.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.580]   Why do we debate?
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.100]   Because we don't agree with one another.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:02.100]   You see, conflict is always preceded by confusion,
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:07.940]   some misunderstanding, and yet it is into their conflict
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.100]   that Jesus enters, and the reason for it
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.780]   is because as he comes to us in our doubt,
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.020]   Jesus repeatedly seeks to calm our confusion with his word.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.360]   Jesus calms our confusion with his word.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   I love that Jesus doesn't just jump straight
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.860]   to fixing their problems.
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.680]   Like he doesn't interject in their conversation,
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.560]   he doesn't correct their misunderstandings,
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.520]   he doesn't direct them, "Hey guys,
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.840]   "y'all better get back to Jerusalem."
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.300]   Instead, what he chooses to do is something
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.520]   that the church fails to do so very often.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:45.000]   He creates conversational space for curiosity
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.660]   and perplexity and even uncertainty
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.340]   because Jesus knows that when it comes to spiritual matters,
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.880]   doubts and questions, they're an inevitable part
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.660]   of the process.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.140]   So let me just speak to the believer in the room
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.000]   for a moment.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.540]   If our churches look and talk and act and believe
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.460]   the same way, then we are not as welcoming
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.500]   to the watching world as we think we are.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.820]   You see, we have to cultivate spaces
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.820]   that we find not only the right answers given,
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.760]   but we see the real questions asked.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:38.420]   We're skeptics and critics and misfits and outcasts.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.920]   They can come and they can honestly process,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.200]   they can sincerely seek and they can hopefully find
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.580]   the same Jesus that found us.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.420]   That's what we have to do.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.780]   So I remember my freshman year,
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.600]   probably a similar experience to some of you
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.260]   if you were there at 18, 19 in your first year of college.
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.620]   Like it was the first year that I found
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.520]   my greatest singular season of spiritually seeking.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.520]   For the first time in my life,
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.060]   nobody was forcing me to go to church.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.140]   Nobody was looking at me and pressuring me
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.100]   to go to Bible study.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.660]   Nobody was coercing me with pizza and video games
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.360]   to go to youth group on Wednesday night.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.920]   Like I could choose to do what I wanted,
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.780]   when I wanted, how I wanted.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.540]   Like it was totally up to me.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.700]   And yet, despite the fact that I had unlimited freedom,
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.840]   I still had this massive curiosity about Christianity.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.100]   Like there were some things for sure
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.940]   that I had questions about, I don't know, man.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.780]   And yet there were other things within the faith
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.220]   that I had a real interest in.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.620]   I found a fascination with.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.260]   And so as I'm navigating the complex waters of Christianity
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.820]   because they are complex waters,
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.500]   I was so fortunate to have an older friend of mine
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:52.660]   spend hours with me at a coffee shop.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.460]   Not driving the conversation,
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.220]   but just clarifying my questions.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.960]   Just helping me along the way.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:03.260]   That's what Jesus does with the disciples in this story.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.100]   Like he welcomes them where they are.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.160]   Like he doesn't narrow their discipleship
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.020]   to a strict set of doctrinal distinctives
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.980]   that double as a source of tribal identity and pride.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:18.540]   He listens to them.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.280]   He walks with them.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.700]   And eventually he does speak to them.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.700]   What does he say?
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.240]   Oh foolish ones.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.940]   Which can sound really biting to our English ears.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.320]   And yet, in the original language,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.480]   it's actually just a statement that's more matter of fact.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.000]   He's looking at them and after everything they've unpacked,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.320]   he simply says something along the lines of,
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.480]   you guys, you know better.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.200]   You know better than this.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.280]   And he patiently proceeds to show them
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.880]   how all of the scripture from Moses
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.720]   to all the prophets are pointing to him.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.040]   In 2 Corinthians, it says it like this.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.060]   For to this day, when they read the old covenant,
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.640]   the same veil remains unlifted because only through Christ
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.080]   is that veil taken away.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.980]   Yes, to this day, whenever Moses read,
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.820]   a veil lies over their hearts.
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.000]   But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.160]   You see, they thought they understood.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.320]   They thought they had it figured out.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.720]   They thought they connected all the dots.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.440]   They thought they had cracked the code.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.200]   But they were wrong.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.400]   Which is actually really good news.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.600]   Doesn't sound like good news.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.820]   None of us want to be wrong.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.440]   And yet it's such good news for the doubtful,
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.720]   for the disappointed.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.000]   Because what it does is it tells us there's hope.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.380]   Disappointment's not the end of your story.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.440]   Doubt's not the end of your story.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.100]   There's a better explanation for your reality
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.580]   than the things that have spoken in already.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.960]   But the way you find that hope,
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.640]   if you start listening to Jesus,
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.040]   then whatever it is caused your confusion
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.360]   in the first place.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.620]   And I think that this is gonna happen
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.160]   for some people in this room tonight.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.980]   Like I think maybe for the first time in a long time,
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.760]   some of us are gonna,
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.000]   we're gonna stop listening to what other people say
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.160]   about God from our podcasts or from our families
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.560]   or our friend groups or from platforms or from social media.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.720]   And we're gonna start listening
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.120]   to what God has to say himself.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.080]   Like rather than letting the culture weigh in
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:29.980]   on our spirituality,
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.040]   we're gonna let the scripture weigh in on our spirituality.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.180]   We're gonna redignify the voice of God in our lives
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.760]   because it is his voice and his voice alone
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.720]   by way of his word that leads us to greater hope.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.640]   And so I think it's gonna happen.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.880]   Like I think some of you, you're gonna open his word.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.240]   You're gonna listen to his voice.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.160]   You're gonna watch the way he lives.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.060]   You're gonna observe the way he engages with other people.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.560]   You're gonna have the chance to see the miracles
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.320]   he performs and then you're going to seek his kingdom.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.860]   And by the grace of God, you're gonna find your faith again.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.860]   Because this is what Jesus does.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.860]   He comes to calm confusion with his word.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.260]   Where's the word at in your life?
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:23.000]   How fast do you hold to it?
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.060]   It's an anchor for the doubting soul.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:33.780]   And it's a sure way to consistently provide a beacon of hope.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.900]   Why do I think all that?
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.300]   Because that's how this story ends.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.260]   We'll pick it up in 28.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.100]   It says, so they drew near to the village
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.060]   to which they were going.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.740]   And Jesus acted as if he was going farther,
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.420]   but they urged him strongly saying, stay with us.
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.940]   It's toward evening and the day is now far spent.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.000]   So he went in to stay with them.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.840]   And when he was at table with them, he took the bread
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.880]   and he blessed and he broke it and he gave it to them.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:06.220]   And their eyes were opened and they recognized him.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.600]   And he vanished from their sight.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.560]   Don't you love it?
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.680]   They said to each other, did not our hearts burn within us
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.720]   while he talked to us on the road?
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.400]   While he opened to us the scriptures.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.700]   Like I love the way the story ends.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.960]   Like Jesus walks with them for seven miles.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.980]   He talks with them through all their doubts.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.820]   He unpacks with them the entirety of the scripture.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.420]   And yet it isn't until he breaks bread with them at dinner
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:37.060]   that they realize this is no ordinary guy.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.500]   This is Jesus.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:44.140]   Like Jesus could have restored their faith theologically.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.020]   He could have restored their faith apologetically.
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.780]   He could have restored their faith philosophically.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.800]   He could have restored their faith historically.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   And yet Jesus chooses to restore their faith relationally.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.900]   He sits at table with them.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.240]   He breaks bread.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.880]   He has a meal.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.760]   Like he chooses to use relationship as the means
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.820]   through which he brings them back to himself.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.060]   Because Jesus doesn't just want your allegiance.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.380]   He wants your affection.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.940]   He wants your affection.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.860]   That's why Jesus, as our third point,
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.020]   rekindles the flame of a heart grown cold.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.580]   Jesus rekindles the flame of a heart grown cold.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.300]   Do you have a cold heart here tonight?
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.420]   Then listen, you're in good company.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.740]   Not because of the people around you,
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.900]   but because of the God above you.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.000]   He's a God that seeks to reignite the fainting flame
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.420]   of faith in the lives of his people.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.300]   And he wants to do it through relationship.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.820]   Like it isn't until he breaks the bread
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.340]   and he extends it to them with the nail pierced hands
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.080]   that he and only he has that they realize.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.180]   Those are the hands that stretched wide
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.920]   on the cross for me back then.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.300]   And they're the same hands which reach out
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.540]   in relationship to me right now.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.100]   They realize that in Jesus,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.220]   he wants more than a theological commitment.
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.820]   He wants more than their moral conformity.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.420]   He wants more than their religious observance.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.380]   He wants a real relationship with them.
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.820]   Like, do you want a real relationship with God?
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.820]   Like not a phony, fake relationship,
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.740]   but not the kind of relationship where it's like,
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.080]   I know some facts about the individual.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.320]   I can fire off a bunch of information that I've learned.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.740]   That's not the kind of relationship he wants.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.180]   He doesn't want the kind of relationship
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.420]   that distantly knows each other from afar.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.860]   He doesn't want the kind of relationship
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.380]   that even just enjoy spending some time together
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.220]   at different moments.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.460]   No, Jesus is not in for that.
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.140]   He wants a real relationship.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.500]   He wants a face-to-face, all the time together,
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.020]   personally knowing, intimately acquainted
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.420]   kind of relationship with you.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.620]   He wants to be close to you.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.340]   That's the kind of heart that Jesus has for his people.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.300]   Yeah, we often don't have the same sort of heart in return.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:06.420]   He takes them back to the place where relationship began,
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.140]   where he breaks bread as a symbol of his broken body.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.700]   He says, I would give everything to have you.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.180]   I'd do anything to get you.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:20.060]   I will give all of myself to get all of you
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:24.460]   because I don't just want your soul, I want your heart.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.480]   I want your heart.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.540]   Maybe you hear that and you think,
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.580]   yeah, man, that sounds nice.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.020]   I bet that that is Jesus's perspective.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:40.020]   I bet he does want relationship with these people,
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.180]   but I don't look anything like them.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.580]   I don't act anything like them.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.020]   I don't come from the same places as any of them.
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.940]   I don't believe any of the same things as them.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.660]   Like, yes, Jesus wants a relationship with them,
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.820]   but I look nothing like them.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.500]   And so therefore, Jesus wants nothing to do with me.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.620]   If that's you and you hear all of this
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.820]   and you know all your doubt
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.440]   and you feel like you don't fit into the story,
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.920]   then you need to know.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.260]   While we know the name of one disciple, Cleopas,
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:22.640]   we do not know the name nor identity of the other.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:28.660]   That disciple, he or she, is known as the unknown disciple.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.460]   And the reason it is is because Luke wants those
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.980]   that feel like this could never be their story
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.340]   to find themselves in the story.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:44.500]   He wants you to know there's no one that Jesus doesn't want.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.020]   There's no person that Jesus doesn't desire.
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.500]   Doesn't matter the depth or the degree of your doubt,
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.780]   this story is telling us that Jesus
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:00.420]   doesn't just want to build in us an unbreakable belief.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:05.300]   He wants to build in us an unbreakable bond,
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.780]   one that can never be broken.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:15.580]   So several years ago, I learned this lesson very personally
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.540]   when I endured what felt like the greatest
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.420]   personal challenge of my life to that point.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.540]   It was one of those dark nights of the soul sort of moments.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.180]   Some of you get what I'm talking about.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:31.220]   I was standing at the precipice of a new job opportunity
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.180]   that was the stuff of my dreams.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:36.340]   Like it was the very thing that I had secretly wished for,
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.900]   journaled about, prayed to God,
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:42.140]   yet never admitted allowed to because it was so ridiculous.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.540]   It was so audacious.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.540]   And yet like I found myself in the throes of a new,
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.820]   in the throes of actually attaining it.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.860]   And so I found in that season,
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.460]   like I was closer to God than ever
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.580]   because I needed God more than ever.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.420]   Like I was religiously, regularly going
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.900]   on prayer walks with God.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.420]   Get out of the house and I would go
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.420]   for long stretches of my day.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.480]   And I would just, I would talk to him.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.320]   I would ask his help.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.820]   I would seek his favor.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.940]   I would declare my trust and I would pray for his will.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.900]   Again and again and again,
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:27.300]   I prayer walked the walls of Jericho down on that thing.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:32.900]   Which is why it was so shocking to me
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.460]   when in the 11th hour,
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:39.980]   the subject of my dreams
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.540]   was like a rug pulled out from underneath me.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.260]   What I thought I was to attain
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.140]   was ripped away from me.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:57.260]   And all I felt like I had were no more dreams,
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.540]   yet only doubts.
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:03.500]   Everything I'd longed for,
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.320]   everything I prayed for,
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.100]   everything I aimed for,
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.260]   all that I had been trying to set myself up to acquire,
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.380]   it was taken away from me in a moment.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:17.060]   And all I felt in that instance
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:23.460]   was frustration and doubt and a faintness of heart
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.100]   that led me to a place in my spirituality
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.940]   I never thought I would find myself.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:32.740]   It was late one evening, about a month or so later,
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.520]   that I was so depressed,
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.860]   I'm sitting in the center of my driveway
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.160]   at probably midnight.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:47.540]   And I have nothing left to say to God.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.180]   I've grumbled against Him,
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.620]   I've warred with Him,
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.900]   I've raged against the heavens,
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.640]   I've expressed all my disappointment.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:02.140]   Some of you get what that feels like.
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:07.080]   And yet as I sat in the center of my driveway,
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:14.820]   I heard that still small voice
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.220]   that is so unmistakably God
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.300]   ask me this question,
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:25.380]   are we still gonna go for walks?
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:32.240]   All of my belief was broken,
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:37.140]   but my bond was not.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:41.540]   No one can take away those
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.940]   that are in relationship to God.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.380]   And no amount of doubt,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.620]   no amount of disappointment,
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.660]   no amount of despair can wring you from His grip.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:54.100]   It is far too strong to ever let you go.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.940]   And you may feel,
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.140]   I'm so far away though,
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.820]   His arm is so very long.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:06.420]   He wants a real relationship with you.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.500]   Because He not only wants your soul,
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.700]   He wants your heart.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.620]   For which God wants your heart.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.260]   And what we learn by the end of this text
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.660]   is He wants it hot.
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:25.140]   And He will pursue you in the coldness of doubt
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.740]   until the flame of faith is rekindled again.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:33.100]   Is your heart burning tonight within you?
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.420]   As you hear these words,
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:38.300]   as this truth washes over your faint spirit,
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.380]   is it burning again?
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.220]   John Wesley, he famously said at his conversion
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.580]   that his heart was gently warmed,
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.460]   strangely warmed.
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:54.620]   Friend, if your heart is warming here,
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:59.060]   it's because Jesus is wanting here.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.020]   He is wanting for you.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.540]   And we have such confidence that that's the case
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.260]   because what we know is when our hearts
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.940]   have grown darker than doubt in the dead of our sins,
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:11.020]   Jesus passionately pursued us anyways.
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.260]   Like He walked towards us
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.220]   and we had all walked away.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.380]   Like all of us, we had abandoned God.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.020]   Like sheep, we had gone astray.
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.500]   And yet Jesus said, "You'll never outrun me.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.540]   "Doesn't matter how far away you walk from me,
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:23.700]   "I'll chase you down.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.780]   "I'll race forward.
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.580]   "I will pursue you still because you're my people.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.020]   "You may not want me, but I want you.
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.620]   "I'm gonna bring you back.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.340]   "I'm gonna put you in my family
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.660]   "because I'm a God, I'm a Savior.
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:39.060]   "I'm a Lord that walks with those that walk away from me."
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.100]   Jesus, He calmed our confusion with His words.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.620]   Like into the misery, in the madness of our sin,
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.380]   He spoke the words of life.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:53.780]   Like He didn't just come to teach you some nice things,
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.020]   to increase your academia,
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.540]   to help you learn some new platitudes.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.220]   No, He came to speak into you life.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:08.260]   And He rekindled the flames of hearts grown cold.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.220]   How cold is a dead heart?
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.580]   It's the coldest of all.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:19.220]   And yet Jesus said, "I will take their cold heart
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:23.540]   "into my chest by dying their death
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.580]   "that they might have my living heart
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.820]   "and they might go free instead."
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:37.460]   It does not matter the degree of your doubt.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:43.460]   What matters is the extent of His love.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:47.260]   He wants relationship.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.380]   Do you want it in return?
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.460]   Let me pray for you.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:57.060]   God, I pray my friends here know
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:04.180]   that you really want them.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.180]   It's impossible, God, for you to need us,
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.900]   for you are all sufficient.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:16.020]   Therefore, God, for you to do what you've done
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.500]   in the person of your Son
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:23.700]   is a staggering declaration that you want all of us.
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.140]   Not because of anything we've done,
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.660]   not because of anything we've earned,
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.260]   not because of anything we deserve, God,
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.620]   but simply because you choose us.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:37.180]   I pray, God, that for those in this room
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.100]   that feel like they are on the precipice of deconstruction,
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:45.020]   that think doubt is all that dwells ahead
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.420]   in their future, God, they might know it's not my doubt
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:52.980]   that awaits for me in the future,
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:57.340]   it's my Jesus that awaits for me instead.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.940]   We love you, God, and we sing to you now
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:05.620]   the worship that is only worthy of you.
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:10.740]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.380]   Hey, porch, you can stand to your feet.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.300]   We're gonna jump back into worship.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.340]   And for a God like that,
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.780]   we're gonna blow the ever-loving roof off of this place.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.020]   (congregation cheering)
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.740]   Like it is week two, it is the beginning of a year,
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:32.740]   and yet we are going to go hard here in the final stretch.
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.220]   We believe that God's worth it, amen?
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:36.060]   - Amen.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.540]   - So we're gonna sing like we believe it.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:41.420]   Sometimes what you have to do to a doubting heart
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.140]   is you have to declare to it the hope it's forgotten.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.260]   That's what we're gonna do as we sing together here.
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.540]   Some of you, you need to process with somebody.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.100]   We've got a team down here to my left and to my right
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.660]   that would love to engage with you,
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.420]   but listen, the band has led, I have led,
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.220]   Now you get to lead the moments yours lets me with them together.
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
