1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:25,600
 - Alright, well hey, welcome friends in the room

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,900
 in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, Fayetteville, Phoenix,

4
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,340
 Boise, Idaho, all the other PortsLive locations,

5
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,540
 and especially all of us in the room.

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,860
 We are continuing the series, Roaring 20s,

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,260
 how to have 20s, the decade between 2020 and 2030

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,120
 that roar in every way you want them to

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,320
 and every way that God wants them to,

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,260
 not to just survive the next decade or your 20s,

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,980
 but to thrive in a way that leads to the type of life

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,700
 that God wants and ultimately you want.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,580
 Tonight, I'm gonna start by just telling kind of a story

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,200
 that'll give some direction for where we're going.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,420
 In college, I had a chance to be on the track team

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,140
 where I went to school, and my first year of college

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,740
 showed up, and track is a spring sport,

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,620
 so the fall was a time of like conditioning and training

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,820
 and just doing a bunch of exercises,

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,420
 getting ready for the season coming up.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,280
 I threw the javelin, which is the most random sport

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,940
 on the planet, which explains how I was able to do it

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,740
 at that school, 'cause there's like three of us

24
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,680
 out there that do it, but anyways,

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,220
 so I was with all the throwers, so you got javelin,

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,020
 shop hood, just people who were part of the throws group.

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,140
 And the biggest challenge in the conditioning season

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,740
 or that semester, the fall semester, that we had,

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,180
 it was a bunch of tests that you'd have to do

30
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,860
 and a bunch of weightlifting things, hear me roar,

31
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,780
 but there was also this thing called the obstacle course.

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,660
 The obstacle course was this test that our coach,

33
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,620
 named Chico, who was like a mad scientist,

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,460
 had put together, and it was something

35
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,620
 that was the most dreaded of all the different tests

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,420
 that we had to do, and it was at the end of the semester,

37
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,340
 so you spent the entire semester training,

38
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,980
 and then you had to end it by doing this obstacle course

39
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,580
 that he'd put together.

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,200
 Here's what it was, briefly.

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,300
 It was basically, you would take these weights

42
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,980
 or these shop hoods that weighed like 16 pounds,

43
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,900
 you'd have to run and snake the bleachers,

44
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,340
 which means run up and run down,

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,780
 and basically run up all the way on the stadium,

46
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,120
 set the weight at the top, come back down,

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,700
 run the bleachers again, pick up another weight,

48
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,820
 run around the track, jumping over hurdles,

49
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,200
 and then snake the bleachers again, set it down,

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,580
 all for time.

51
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,060
 So I didn't know exactly what to expect

52
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,460
 and how hard this would be, and I show up on the day

53
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,380
 that the obstacle course is there, and everybody,

54
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,600
 it's like their least favorite day.

55
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,340
 You can just tell, everyone is like getting ready for it,

56
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,500
 and as a freshman, you really don't know

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,560
 exactly what to expect.

58
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,780
 I've never done this before, so you have this mixture

59
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,660
 of like all this insecurity of am I about to die,

60
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,220
 and all of this pride of like these pansies,

61
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,400
 I'm about to take this thing down and set a new record,

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,780
 and the coach looks at me and says,

63
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,660
 hey, you're the youngest, you'll go first, set the pace.

64
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,060
 So again, step into the line, getting ready for this,

65
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,100
 about to show Usain Bolt here, and I take off,

66
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,580
 and I pick up the weight, and I run,

67
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,620
 and I snake the bleachers, and things are going okay,

68
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,060
 and I'm going up and down, and I'm going up and down,

69
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,960
 and I get to the top, I'm finishing lap one,

70
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,160
 I set the weight down there, continue running,

71
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,760
 go and pick up the second weight, I'm about to start lap two,

72
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,980
 start to run around the track, jumping over the hurdles,

73
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,740
 get back to the bleachers, snake 'em again,

74
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,420
 and it was like everything in my body that was going,

75
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,740
 man, I'm a phenom, I mean, literally, the coach,

76
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,100
 at some point, I look over, and he's showing another coach

77
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,260
 my time of lap one, and I'm like, dude,

78
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,180
 they're about to move me to the sprinters team,

79
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,340
 that's what's about to happen.

80
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,340
 And I get to that first bleacher step,

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,800
 and my body is like, shut her down!

82
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,380
 And lactic acid fills my legs,

83
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,460
 like, I didn't even know this much lactic acid existed

84
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,740
 in your legs, and everything that was going

85
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,060
 from like a sprint literally shuts

86
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,660
 and comes to a complete halt, and it becomes like a walk

87
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,940
 for the rest of the time, trying to do these bleachers.

88
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,980
 I mean, it was like to the point of embarrassment

89
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,260
 where like the entire track, all of a sudden,

90
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,900
 it's like, you know, they're out there in the field,

91
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,500
 and everyone's attention goes from like,

92
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,100
 whatever they're doing to, look at, like out of pity,

93
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,700
 you know those moments where they're like,

94
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,420
 someone please make it stop, I just feel terrible for him,

95
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,420
 look at him, he's so unathletic, and I just,

96
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,800
 for like such a snail's pace, I didn't even know

97
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,500
 if I was going to be able to finish it,

98
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,980
 and kept moving, and finally just kind of got

99
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,840
 to the very end, and totally collapsed,

100
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,420
 and my coach comes over, and he says,

101
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,980
 "David, that was the fastest first lap I've ever seen."

102
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,200
 And that was the slowest second lap I have ever seen.

103
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,700
 It wasn't, I lost to everybody, and it wasn't even close,

104
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,900
 it was like, you know, six minutes, six minutes,

105
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,320
 six minutes, 49 minutes.

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,540
 I mean, it was like guys that weighed 300 pounds

107
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,100
 over shop putters were like jogging past me,

108
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,340
 and it was just one of those occasions

109
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,900
 where what had started so well, and had so much momentum,

110
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,940
 all of a sudden came to such a halt,

111
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,400
 and my ability to even keep running was no longer possible.

112
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,600
 What does that have to do with what we're talking

113
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,180
 about tonight?

114
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,580
 Well, tonight we're going to examine one of the truths

115
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,500
 and principles from God's word that really we're doing

116
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,680
 throughout this series that we're covering.

117
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,920
 In this young adult age, there are certain issues

118
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,400
 that are really at the forefront of things

119
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,420
 that if you're going to thrive, or have 20s that roar,

120
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,340
 you need to know how to handle these different issues.

121
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,400
 And handle them not just according to your friend's opinion

122
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,000
 or the latest blog, but according to God's word.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,540
 Things like dating, finances, career,

124
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,540
 like what does it look like to approach these topics well?

125
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,120
 And tonight's topic isn't any of those,

126
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,200
 but I think is as important as any other topic

127
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,720
 that we're going to have in this series.

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,720
 Because if you don't get this topic right,

129
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,500
 it will hinder your ability to keep running.

130
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,720
 It's the reason why so many Christians go out with a bang,

131
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,240
 or they have this season in their life where they're like,

132
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,320
 I'm on fire for Jesus, I'll never walk away,

133
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,220
 and just I'm all in, I'm going to become a missionary.

134
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,480
 And then something happens, and slowly they just begin

135
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,760
 to drift away from their faith, and they don't even know

136
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,200
 if they believe in God anymore.

137
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,800
 It's responsible for why so many people

138
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,640
 who claim to be Christians, and they pledge their life

139
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,120
 to another person who claims to be a Christian,

140
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
 and they stand on an altar and say,

141
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,740
 'til death do us part, and then a number of years later,

142
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,280
 sign papers that say, I don't want anything to do with you,

143
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,680
 I want a divorce.

144
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,440
 Because they didn't apply this principle,

145
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,560
 this biblical truth.

146
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,040
 It's a reason why so many of you, candidly,

147
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
 feel so alone right now.

148
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,620
 And there's an anxiety that kind of washes over you,

149
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,080
 and you wonder if anyone out there cares.

150
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,320
 It's a reason why so many people who claim to be Christians

151
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,980
 don't actually look any different than the world around us,

152
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,360
 and give a bad name to Christ.

153
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,040
 And it's this principle, or this idea,

154
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,920
 related to this topic, your friendships.

155
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,360
 Tonight, what I wanna talk about

156
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,820
 is having the right friendships.

157
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,820
 The Bible, over and over, says that if you get this wrong,

158
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,280
 you can know the path that you are headed on

159
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,520
 is not gonna be a path that you're gonna like.

160
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,160
 It's been well said that, man, you show me your friends,

161
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,200
 and I'll show you your future,

162
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,660
 and the Bible says that over and over and over.

163
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,460
 So what I wanna talk about is, in this stage,

164
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,760
 making sure you have the right friendships

165
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,900
 and relationships around you,

166
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,060
 that your squad is filled with the people

167
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,740
 that the God who's there wants to be a part of that.

168
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,500
 So I wanna define what type

169
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,180
 of right relationships you should have.

170
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,820
 And if you're taking notes, you can write this down,

171
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,420
 right friendships, biblically, like these are the people,

172
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,920
 no matter who's been my crew,

173
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,620
 the world says ride or die.

174
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,780
 It is not ride or die with the wrong people.

175
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,400
 The friendships that I should have

176
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,640
 should be relationships that I live authentically

177
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,140
 in relationship with people committed to Christ.

178
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,980
 The type of friendships that should mark your life

179
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,940
 is living authentically in relationships,

180
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,420
 like ongoing, with people who are committed to Christ.

181
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,540
 This is the thing that if you're back in church,

182
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,300
 and we get this story all the time,

183
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,540
 and you're like, man, this is my year,

184
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,140
 I'm going all in, I really wanna get serious.

185
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,100
 I can tell you right now whether or not 2020

186
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,100
 is gonna be a year where you grow closer to God or not,

187
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,060
 if you tell me who you're running with.

188
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,580
 And so if you are a follower of Jesus,

189
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,740
 and you want to really see and experience

190
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,600
 the transformation, the type of life,

191
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,040
 you wanna head towards the right marriage someday,

192
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,820
 you wanna make sure that you're not being a fool

193
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,360
 as it relates to your money, your career,

194
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,720
 all those different things,

195
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,000
 at the epicenter of that,

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,260
 directly related to your ability

197
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,260
 to wisely navigate those arenas

198
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,200
 is gonna be the friendships that you have around.

199
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
 So let me unpack this sentence.

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
 Every single word in that sentence was intentionally chosen

201
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,120
 that you would live authentically in relationship

202
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,520
 with people committed to Christ.

203
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,200
 Live authentically in relationship

204
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,060
 with people committed to Christ.

205
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,900
 What do I mean by that?

206
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,520
 So first thing, live authentically.

207
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,580
 This is probably the hardest one,

208
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,320
 because 90% of you in the room are gonna be like,

209
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,020
 dude, check the box, I feel like I'm done,

210
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,080
 I'm gonna go see the food trucks.

211
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,040
 I live authentically, and you don't.

212
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,720
 You manage information, you don't tell the whole truth,

213
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,600
 you don't actually live in a way

214
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
 that has other believers in your life

215
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,560
 who know where you're hurting, you're struggling,

216
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,440
 where you're having a hard time,

217
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,360
 where your mind is just like tripping on toxic thought

218
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,160
 after toxic thought, who know your internet history,

219
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,920
 who know the relationship that you're in,

220
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,160
 they know the ins and the outs

221
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,160
 and all the different ways that you are living

222
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,200
 or not living according to God.

223
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,040
 And I know some of you are like,

224
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,400
 no, I really think that I am.

225
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,200
 The vast majority of you,

226
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,800
 this is not something that you are experiencing,

227
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,240
 and I'll unpack why I say that here in a second.

228
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,280
 And then the others of us,

229
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,560
 that maybe you're in a place where you're like,

230
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,320
 no, I really am living authentically

231
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,360
 with the community group and with my friendships,

232
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,680
 people who love God.

233
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,800
 This is a tension that it never goes away.

234
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,880
 It's something to constantly pursue, living authentically.

235
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,720
 What do I mean by that?

236
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,320
 The Bible says that you and I,

237
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,720
 in Hebrews chapter three, verse 12 and 13,

238
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,240
 are to see to it, brothers,

239
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,360
 that none of you has a sinful and unbelieving heart

240
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,160
 that turns away from the living God,

241
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,120
 but encourage, or in other words,

242
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,480
 here's the remedy to make sure,

243
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,320
 none of you allow sin to get buried in your heart

244
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,640
 and it begins to grow and grow and harden your heart

245
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
 and turn you away from God.

246
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,080
 And the way that you prevent that heart hardening

247
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,480
 is by doing this,

248
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,480
 but encourage or exhort or call out one another daily,

249
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,720
 as long as it's called today.

250
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,840
 This is like him saying, every day that ends in Y,

251
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,760
 so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness,

252
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
 that you're to have relationships

253
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,000
 with other people in your life,

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 that you are open in such a way

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,640
 where they can speak into your life

256
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,000
 and you can speak into theirs,

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,320
 the places where they need to be called out

258
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,300
 and where you need to be called out.

259
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,000
 James chapter five, verse 16 says,

260
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 confess your sins to each other

261
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,220
 and pray for each other so that you would be healed.

262
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,360
 Do you have people in your life

263
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,000
 that you can actually be honest and confess sins to?

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,840
 And that they don't respond by making fun of you

265
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,160
 or just being like, dude, it's cool,

266
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,120
 you know, everybody does it,

267
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,120
 but they sit there, they pray for you,

268
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,040
 they come alongside and encourage and hold you accountable

269
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,160
 where you can be authentic, known.

270
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,400
 Ephesians chapter four, verse 25 says,

271
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,440
 stop telling lies.

272
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,320
 Praise him.

273
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,600
 Let us tell our neighbors or one another the truth

274
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,240
 for we are all part of the same body.

275
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,220
 This means not managing information,

276
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,640
 it means you being honest

277
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,120
 and telling people the whole truth,

278
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,920
 being specific about where you're having a tough time

279
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,380
 and living in the light,

280
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,120
 not with every single person everywhere

281
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,580
 and posting it all on Facebook,

282
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,080
 but with authentic relationships in your life

283
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,360
 where you can be real with other people.

284
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,780
 The Bible says this is to mark you and I's life.

285
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,860
 It's funny living in 2020,

286
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,700
 one of my favorite things about living today

287
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,220
 is social media, like this explosion of social media

288
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,100
 that the vast majority of human history

289
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,860
 has not had anything like,

290
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,060
 but today, I mean, just with Facebook

291
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,860
 and with Instagram and with Twitter,

292
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,040
 like it allows you to keep up with high school friends,

293
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,940
 you would have no idea what they're up to,

294
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,380
 but I like know high school friends,

295
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,440
 you know, their kids' names

296
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,160
 or people just kind of in my tribe

297
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,580
 that previously had there been no Facebook, no Instagram,

298
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,660
 I would have no idea what's going on

299
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,660
 or that you have a dog or that you live in Phoenix

300
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,980
 or any of the different ways that you're able to connect.

301
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,900
 And not only that, you're able to like, you know,

302
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,820
 know about one another's life

303
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,940
 in ways that are both, you know,

304
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,460
 awesome and fun to connect with or know what's going on

305
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,700
 and kind of hilarious.

306
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,080
 Like there's never been a time in human history

307
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,820
 where you would feel like I need to share

308
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,580
 with every friend I have ever and all of my family

309
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,340
 and even some strangers that this avocado toast,

310
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,540
 avocado toast I had is just so delicious,

311
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,460
 got to try this recipe, link in the bio.

312
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,260
 There'd never be a time where I would say that,

313
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,620
 you know, there'd never be a time where I'm like,

314
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,420
 I need to tell every person out there everywhere

315
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,220
 about my workout that I just had

316
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,460
 and so I'm going to call up all my friends.

317
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,400
 Guys, it was brutal, this WOD, you wouldn't believe it.

318
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,380
 I mean, it was just, it would never happen.

319
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,580
 But now with social media, we all feel compelled to like,

320
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,980
 hey, I'm going to get this out there and click

321
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,740
 and hey guys, this is what I did today.

322
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,580
 Here's what's going on in my life.

323
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,580
 But look at this sunset, look how beautiful it is.

324
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,700
 And I need to tell everyone everywhere about this sunset.

325
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,360
 It's just a funny time.

326
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,660
 But it also is a great time because it leaves us connected.

327
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,080
 But I think one of the dangers of social media

328
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,080
 is that it teaches us to be amazing managers

329
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,740
 of people's perception of us.

330
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,500
 It's just kind of part of the game.

331
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,580
 Like everyone's social media, and I know we all know this,

332
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,260
 like everyone, you look at Instagram, you're Facebook,

333
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
 you're like, yeah, that is not actually their real life

334
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,780
 and we're all doing it and you can even make money off

335
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,600
 of doing it by being called an influencer

336
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,300
 where you are shaping the perception

337
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,060
 that people have of you.

338
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,000
 And we, without even knowing it,

339
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,820
 are becoming better and better managers

340
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,500
 of people's perception of us.

341
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,320
 What do I mean?

342
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,100
 Like not long ago, my wife and I, it was Mother's Day,

343
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,260
 and we went and we celebrated, we had Mother's Day brunch.

344
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,860
 Here's a picture from mine.

345
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,500
 So we had Mother's Day brunch, there's two little kids,

346
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,660
 and you know, this is great.

347
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,440
 And underneath is like a caption of, hey, Callie,

348
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,820
 you are like the goat of moms, you're the best,

349
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,420
 something sweet, really romantic.

350
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,820
 Just, you know, you know what I'm saying?

351
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,460
 And I don't know why I winked.

352
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,300
 (audience laughing)

353
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,780
 I was like, she's here, like, hey, baby, you know what I'm

354
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,620
 saying?

355
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,580
 (audience laughing)

356
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,280
 But here's what you don't know in that picture.

357
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,860
 It's like on the way to this breakfast that we're going

358
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,020
 to have brunch for Mother's Day, we're in conflict

359
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,460
 because I didn't get her a card for Mother's Day,

360
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,780
 and I know, just stop judging me right now.

361
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,380
 And I got her other gifts and I had our kids sign the card,

362
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,980
 just different conflicts, so we're in conflict there.

363
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,940
 And then at the brunch, we're there with family,

364
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,000
 our kids are going crazy, the daughter is sick,

365
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,300
 she won't sit still, the entire thing was miserable.

366
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,820
 It was like, this is the worst, the Mother's Day brunch

367
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,740
 is disgusting, and this is the worst Mother's Day brunch

368
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,580
 of all time.

369
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,180
 But then if you were to just look on my world,

370
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,660
 you'd be like, oh my gosh, I'm so envious about what they

371
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,500
 have right now.

372
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,580
 Or I don't know what emotion you would have,

373
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,180
 but you would go, oh, that looked like it must have been

374
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,020
 such a great brunch.

375
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,700
 It was a terrible brunch, terrible morning,

376
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,940
 I'm still recovering, to be honest.

377
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,780
 And,

378
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,220
 (audience laughing)

379
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,140
 that's not true.

380
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,380
 But we're excellent, and I'm not trying to mismanage

381
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,460
 or trying to throw it out there.

382
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,880
 Nobody wants to go to the Instagram page and it's like,

383
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,760
 this actually is a deceitful picture and not actually

384
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,040
 accurately capturing what's going on.

385
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,680
 But my point is, without even realizing it,

386
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,120
 we are experts at managing what people think

387
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,800
 and trying to manage the perception that they have of us,

388
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,920
 what they think about us.

389
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,120
 And where this becomes really dangerous is it begins

390
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,680
 to bleed in, I think, for lots of us, into our real life.

391
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,840
 Where we're so good at it, we've taught ourselves

392
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,160
 to be so good at it, that when it comes to actual

393
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,980
 human relationships, like not Instagram relationships,

394
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,660
 like real friends, we're constantly in the mode

395
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,300
 of manage information, manage people's perception.

396
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,860
 Don't actually be honest, try to say what you think

397
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,220
 they want you to say, try to be the person that you think

398
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,060
 that they want to see, and we're constantly keeping

399
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,020
 these superficial relationships.

400
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,900
 And the tragedy is, all of us share the deep desire

401
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,380
 to be known, to be accepted, and to be loved.

402
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,320
 And as long as I decide I'm gonna manage what you think

403
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,680
 about me, I'm not actually gonna tell you

404
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,340
 what I'm having a tough time, I'm not actually gonna

405
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,080
 open up my life, you can't actually love me,

406
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,180
 because you don't actually know me.

407
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,820
 You know some superficial version of me.

408
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,780
 And my fear for many in this room is that you're gonna go

409
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,400
 your entire life, and you will have the depth

410
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,740
 of friendships of an Instagram relationship.

411
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,060
 Today in this room, I would guess the vast majority of us

412
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,880
 have very few people that we can be real with,

413
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,280
 we're authentic with, they know us.

414
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,340
 And I know some of us do, and we're pursuing that

415
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,660
 in community, and we're opening up our lives.

416
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,620
 But thousands listening to me wherever you are,

417
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,920
 and inside of this room, living this way,

418
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,960
 where it's just basically, I'm terrified of you

419
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,740
 actually knowing the real me, so I'm gonna put out

420
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,780
 the me that I think everyone wants.

421
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,600
 And so no one ever gets to love the real you.

422
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,460
 They get to love some manicured version of you.

423
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,260
 And as Christians, we are called to live in the light,

424
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,660
 and have real relationships marked by living authentically.

425
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,100
 So what does this mean?

426
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,320
 It means you, in your small group, if you have one,

427
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,620
 going and sharing about the areas of your life

428
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,180
 where you're having a hard time,

429
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,580
 where you are needing God to take work,

430
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,460
 it means sharing, struggling, things like this.

431
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,260
 Man, I'm struggling this week to believe that God is good

432
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,340
 because my mom has cancer,

433
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,100
 and I don't know if it's going away.

434
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,660
 It means sharing, hey, guys, I need to confess,

435
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,180
 this week I went farther physically than I wanted to,

436
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,940
 and in my dating relationship with her,

437
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,260
 I need you to hold me accountable,

438
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,420
 help me think through boundaries,

439
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,620
 I wanna bring you guys in, and I just wanna confess

440
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,380
 that I don't wanna walk in the dark with that.

441
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,700
 It means sharing that, man, I'm really struggling

442
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,780
 over anxiety about my job, and while I'm at work,

443
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,900
 what other people think about me,

444
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,580
 and what I'm gonna do if a layoff happens,

445
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,940
 like you just bring that, and you say,

446
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,260
 this is where I'm really struggling, will you pray for me?

447
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,180
 It means being honest about just, there's times we're bent.

448
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,520
 Life can be really hard and sad, and you share, I'm sad.

449
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,900
 I'm sad this week.

450
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,420
 I'm disappointed about my relationship status.

451
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
 Like, lots of my friends are moving on

452
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,620
 to the next phase of life.

453
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,820
 Some of 'em already have kids, maybe most have kids,

454
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,900
 and I feel like God has forgotten me,

455
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,140
 and I'm not sure it's gonna happen,

456
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,740
 and whether or not it will, I just need you to know,

457
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,500
 I'm like a little depressed in this moment,

458
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,860
 and you bring others in.

459
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,780
 You don't over-spiritualize it and try to pretend like,

460
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,300
 you know, hey, I lost my job,

461
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,780
 God, all things work together for good, everything's fine,

462
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,340
 if you don't actually believe that.

463
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,540
 You don't minimize it and pretend

464
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,980
 that things are not hard when they are.

465
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,220
 Some of you, like, maybe the biggest takeaway you can have

466
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,900
 is to learn to not just say, whenever you're like weeping

467
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,420
 about something really hard in your life,

468
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,820
 and someone's like, man, I'm so sorry for you,

469
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,140
 just say, no, everything's fine.

470
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,300
 One thing is a clear, clear signal.

471
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,420
 When someone's bawling about something hard in their life,

472
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,580
 and they respond with everything's fine,

473
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,820
 everything is not fine in that moment, and it's okay.

474
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,140
 And as followers of Jesus, the relationship

475
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,740
 that God designed and wired you for

476
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,640
 is to be known and loved and cared for,

477
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,600
 and to have that with other Christians inside of your life.

478
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,100
 The challenge I think that most of us get into is like,

479
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,140
 dude, what are they gonna think?

480
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,900
 If I bring that to the group, I'm like,

481
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,020
 I'm anxious about this, I need to confess,

482
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,100
 I clicked on this, I need to confess,

483
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,260
 you know, we crossed boundaries physically.

484
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,700
 With my girlfriend, what are they gonna think about me?

485
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,940
 Let me answer that question really quickly.

486
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,940
 Here's what they're gonna think, ready?

487
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,860
 They're gonna think you're a lot like them,

488
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,260
 only really honest.

489
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,380
 They're gonna think, huh,

490
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,940
 they don't have it together either.

491
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,480
 They're just more honest than I am.

492
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,700
 That's what they're gonna think.

493
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,160
 Let me tell you what they're not gonna think.

494
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,740
 When you bring the group and you're like,

495
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,140
 hey, look, you know, we've been dating,

496
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,740
 we're trying to pursue purity,

497
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,540
 and we messed up this week, here's what we did,

498
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,060
 you know, hands went places they shouldn't have gone,

499
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,900
 and you confess that to the group.

500
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,960
 Here's what I've never heard happened.

501
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,460
 The group sits there, oh, huh, okay, yeah, oh, wow, man,

502
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,660
 thanks for sharing that.

503
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,300
 Are you telling me that there's a girl you're dating

504
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,480
 that you find really attractive and you hope to marry,

505
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,480
 and that led you to cross boundaries physically?

506
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,420
 Oh my, what sort of pervert are you?

507
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,620
 (audience laughing)

508
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,860
 I don't even know what to do with this.

509
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,080
 This is just, my mind is blown, how could you?

510
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,480
 (audience laughing)

511
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,320
 That's insane.

512
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,400
 Doesn't make it right, and it doesn't make something

513
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,900
 that you should allow to take place,

514
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,800
 but it never happens where people are like,

515
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,720
 I don't even have a category for that, wow,

516
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,240
 you guys really like each other, and what?

517
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,880
 I've never heard the story of a girl who brought forward,

518
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,600
 like, man, I'm just struggling, or a guy who brought forward,

519
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,380
 I'm struggling in this season of singleness right now,

520
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,600
 and I'm just disappointed 'cause, like, my timeline

521
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,600
 and where I hope to be, I'm realizing it's not possible.

522
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,520
 Like, it's not happening for me,

523
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,080
 and I never heard the group come around and go,

524
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,960
 what is wrong with you?

525
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,880
 Trust God already.

526
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,500
 No.

527
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,320
 If they love Jesus, they're gonna be good lovers of people

528
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,800
 like Jesus was, and they're gonna say, man,

529
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,840
 thank you for sharing that, let me pray for you,

530
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,360
 and I'm there, me too, and I have experienced that.

531
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,560
 How can I walk with you and encourage you and remind you?

532
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,280
 And there's this lie that all of us,

533
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,680
 as crazy as those lies are, to believe that,

534
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,760
 man, what are they gonna think?

535
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,520
 They're gonna think you're honest.

536
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,300
 And if they love Jesus, and you should be

537
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,440
 in authentic relationships with people who love Jesus,

538
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,000
 they should respond like Christ calls us to.

539
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,440
 The second part of the sentence of, hey,

540
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,240
 living authentically is living in relationship.

541
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,600
 That's not a typo or being redundant.

542
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,240
 That's included because it means that you should be

543
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,400
 in ongoing, consistent, continual relationships

544
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,720
 with a group, with specific people,

545
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,520
 not just random one-off conversations

546
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,400
 with a priest that you confess to,

547
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,800
 not just random one-off conversations

548
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,400
 with somebody down front,

549
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,840
 not just random one-off conversations

550
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,880
 with somebody who lives in Omaha

551
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,920
 and somebody who lives in New York

552
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,160
 and this friend that you had over here

553
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,560
 and your mom every once in a while,

554
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,500
 consistent, ongoing relationships,

555
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,080
 that you would have friendships,

556
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,320
 that you are authentic and they are in relationship,

557
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,800
 consistent, ongoing, regular relationships together.

558
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,400
 The Bible says in chapter Hebrews, verse 10,

559
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,780
 that you and I are to do this, verse 24.

560
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,280
 And let us consider how we may spur one another on

561
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,580
 toward love and good deeds,

562
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,560
 not neglecting to meet together

563
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,400
 as some are in the habit of doing,

564
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,320
 but encouraging one another and all the more,

565
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,940
 as you see the day, which is of Christ returning, approaching.

566
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,860
 So Paul says, hey, don't give up, keep meeting together.

567
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,020
 Some people are in the habit of not meeting together.

568
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,120
 Don't be like those people

569
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,080
 he anticipates there's gonna be people who are like,

570
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,780
 you know what, I love Jesus,

571
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,280
 I'm good just being Jesus, no church.

572
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,200
 Paul's like, hey, don't be that guy,

573
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,040
 you don't wanna be him.

574
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,600
 You wanna be someone who continues to meet together.

575
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,080
 And then he uses interesting terms.

576
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,000
 He says, and spur, that's like a horse metaphor.

577
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,680
 Somebody has spurs, they push

578
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,800
 and they encourage one another towards being more loving

579
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,420
 and having their life filled with more good things,

580
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,360
 good deeds that they come alongside and they encourage.

581
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,160
 The relationships where people are going,

582
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,000
 man, how can I help you be more of the girl

583
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,160
 that you wanna be, more of the guy that you wanna be,

584
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,360
 more of the husband you wanna be,

585
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,700
 more of the follower of Jesus.

586
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,360
 I wanna be a source of helping you get there

587
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,120
 and I need you to be a source of that in my life.

588
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,420
 Let me ask you a question before we keep going.

589
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,060
 Do you have those types of relationships?

590
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,460
 Like, do you have friends in your life

591
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,020
 that spur you on in your faith?

592
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,720
 That consistently, not every once in a while,

593
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,080
 not a pastor, not somebody that you met one time

594
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,800
 or a counselor in isolation or only,

595
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,240
 but people in your life, a group of believers around you

596
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,600
 that encourage and spur you on

597
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,720
 to be more of who God calls you to be.

598
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,720
 Like I said, this means, by this,

599
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,400
 I don't mean that if you're walking through,

600
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,940
 you live authentically and you just randomly call

601
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,000
 and you confess one sin to your friend John over here

602
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,720
 and then the next week you call Carl who lives over here

603
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,560
 and then the next week you call Bill who lives over here.

604
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,040
 You have people in your life who know what's going on

605
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,040
 in that group and you don't meet with them separately,

606
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,200
 that they're all a part of it

607
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,040
 and you're doing life and walking together.

608
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,760
 This has been some of the guys that,

609
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,560
 for the last five years, have been in my life,

610
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,040
 all the guys that are at the top,

611
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,120
 that for the last five years,

612
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,720
 every single Friday morning we've met together for breakfast

613
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,520
 on Thursday evenings we meet as a group

614
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,560
 and they have been, they are not impressed with me,

615
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,680
 they don't think anything about me

616
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,920
 other than pastors get to be Christians too.

617
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,520
 So we know that you're messed up just like we are

618
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,960
 and let's all come together and encourage one another.

619
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,280
 And they've walked alongside and prayed for

620
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,720
 and as we've walked through hard times in our marriage,

621
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,960
 they know where we're struggling,

622
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,520
 they know the temptations that take me out

623
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,560
 and it's not perfect and we meet together

624
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,240
 in everyday ordinary moments

625
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,980
 and we talk about what God is teaching us,

626
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,520
 we talk about where we need to double down

627
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,680
 and love our wives better,

628
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,880
 we talk about the different ways that we just need God

629
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,560
 to win in our heart because we're believing different lies.

630
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,680
 And it doesn't, if you were to show up

631
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,080
 for one Friday morning, you wouldn't be like,

632
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,920
 oh my gosh, it's like just magical,

633
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,080
 there's an aura of spirit dust everywhere and wow,

634
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,980
 it's just like ordinary moments.

635
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,800
 And in those moments, when you put them together

636
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,880
 over time, God does extraordinary things

637
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,800
 because those authentic relationships

638
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,120
 where people encourage and you walk together

639
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,980
 and they support you and they remind you

640
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,280
 of who you want to or who God calls you to be

641
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,720
 and call up areas of your life

642
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,840
 where you're not being the man God calls you to be.

643
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,240
 Those are the ways that God transforms people.

644
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,560
 And it's not a perfect group, there is no perfect group,

645
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,140
 but do you have a group of people that are in your life

646
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,500
 walking alongside of you?

647
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,780
 Community or the type of relationships that I'm saying

648
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,100
 are like any relationships, they are forged, not found.

649
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,780
 Any great relationships are forged, not found.

650
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,780
 In other words, they take work, it would be like this.

651
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,780
 It's just like a great marriage, like a great marriage.

652
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,780
 Let me just pop the puzzle,

653
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,460
 pubble for anybody out there who thinks someday

654
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,300
 they're gonna get married and they're gonna find the one

655
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,780
 and this person is gonna be, you know,

656
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,100
 you wouldn't say you think they're the one

657
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,440
 'cause you've been around long enough and you're like,

658
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,940
 I know they don't complete me, they're not the one,

659
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,780
 but they're pretty great.

660
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,460
 And they're gonna be someone that you're gonna get

661
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,380
 into marriage with and if you wanna have a great marriage,

662
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,660
 no matter how well you click, you guys like the same,

663
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,860
 you know, movies, TV shows, sports, songs, everything,

664
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,500
 whatever that is, it's gonna take work

665
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,820
 to have a great marriage.

666
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,540
 And if you're sitting and you're engaged right now

667
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,900
 and you're elbowing like, not us baby,

668
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,720
 it's always gonna be honeymoon.

669
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,780
 The honeymoon will be over within like a week

670
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,320
 and then you'll be into a place where you have to work

671
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,660
 'cause you're like, oh wow, you're a girl

672
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,580
 and this is not as easy as I thought.

673
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,260
 And she's like, oh man, you're a guy

674
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,620
 and you smell really bad and this is not as easy

675
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,620
 as I thought and the work begins because great marriages,

676
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,460
 like any great relationship, they're forged.

677
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,420
 You don't find them.

678
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,400
 You don't believe me right now or some of y'all don't,

679
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,820
 but that is the truth.

680
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,900
 They take work, so it is with community

681
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,860
 that great relationships take work,

682
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,780
 they take prioritizing, especially when you're post-college.

683
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,900
 Like some of us, for me, some of my closest friends

684
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,060
 in the world were all in the college phase

685
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,060
 and they're guys that loved Jesus

686
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,040
 and that I still to this day keep up with

687
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,500
 and we're such close friends.

688
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,700
 But the way that we formed relationships then

689
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,500
 was almost not even fair 'cause you're in college.

690
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,060
 I mean, you're like, dude, we spend all the time together.

691
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,780
 We have three hours of class a day

692
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,220
 and sometimes we don't even go

693
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,660
 and then we just do whatever we want

694
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,260
 and we're at Whataburger till three in the morning

695
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,220
 and we're living together

696
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,460
 and you have all of this time to spend together

697
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,540
 and now you have a job and you live separately

698
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,300
 and you're meeting people that are in your small group

699
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,440
 that you've never met before

700
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,940
 and you're trying to form a relationship

701
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,540
 and you're like, this isn't as easy as these other friends

702
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,080
 because you haven't spent as much time with them

703
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,560
 as you have those other friends.

704
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,840
 It takes prioritizing, pursuing them,

705
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,640
 being patient and time and working towards that

706
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,240
 to create those types of relationships.

707
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,760
 And I know, in case you're wondering,

708
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,880
 if you're sitting in a group,

709
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,760
 there is not a group out there where there's not times

710
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,640
 where everybody's like,

711
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,160
 I don't think I really wanna go tonight.

712
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,920
 I don't think I really wanna be a part of that.

713
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,160
 Every single Friday morning at 6 a.m. I'm like,

714
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,480
 oh, I do not wanna go to this again.

715
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,220
 And then I get there and I always leave going,

716
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,720
 man, that was such a great reminder.

717
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,660
 I'm so glad I was a part of this.

718
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,640
 So when you're driving in your car and you're like,

719
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,880
 I'm sitting in traffic and I do not wanna be a part of this,

720
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,520
 you're probably doing it right.

721
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,960
 And push through and pursue in relationship,

722
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,320
 living authentically with people who are committed to Christ

723
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,480
 and it's gonna be worth it.

724
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,120
 And in the end, you're gonna win.

725
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,500
 Finally, the third component of this sentence

726
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,700
 of the right relationship to look for

727
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,420
 is to be living authentically in relationship, ongoing,

728
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,580
 with people who are committed to Christ.

729
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,840
 People who are committed to Christ,

730
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,100
 not living authentically in relationship

731
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,380
 with a CrossFit community

732
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,420
 or living authentically in relationship

733
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,100
 with a neighborhood around you

734
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,180
 or living authentically in community with family members.

735
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,020
 None of those.

736
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,620
 Excuse me, living authentically in community

737
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,900
 or in relationship with people who are committed to Christ.

738
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,420
 The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 6, verses 14,

739
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,180
 a verse that we've read many times before

740
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
 in the context of marriage, but it says,

741
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:50,180
 "Do not be yoked or partnered together with unbelievers.

742
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,460
 "For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?

743
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,820
 "What fellowship can light have with darkness?"

744
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,120
 The apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, verse 33 said this,

745
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,740
 "Do not be misled."

746
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,860
 As in like, hey, what I'm about to tell you

747
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,980
 is something where a lot of people get misled.

748
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,140
 They're fools or they don't realize

749
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,820
 that this is a true thing.

750
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,460
 So don't be misled, don't be like them.

751
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,700
 Here's something you need to know.

752
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,300
 Bad company corrupts good character.

753
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,620
 Who you run with is more powerful than your character.

754
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,540
 Think about that.

755
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,380
 That's what he just said.

756
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,340
 Like that is a crazy verse.

757
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,500
 And Paul says, hey, look, you can be a great character,

758
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,640
 raised in a great home, make convictions at a deep level

759
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,080
 that you'll never do X, Y, and Z.

760
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,580
 But if you run with the wrong crowd,

761
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,860
 you're gonna run in the wrong direction.

762
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,060
 That the company you keep is more powerful

763
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,620
 than the character you have.

764
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,540
 The company you keep, like who's around you,

765
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,900
 who's in your inner circle, who speaks into your life,

766
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,320
 who influences you, who you spend the most time with,

767
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,020
 those people are gonna be more powerful

768
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,860
 than the convictions that you hold.

769
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,460
 Think about that.

770
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,380
 And that's not an opinion, that is the Bible.

771
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,940
 That's why it's been great.

772
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,100
 It's been rightly summarized.

773
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,120
 All throughout scripture, it says,

774
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,180
 you can see your friends and then see your future,

775
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,780
 where you're headed towards.

776
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,140
 And Paul says, do not be deceived.

777
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,820
 Who you run with will determine

778
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,800
 where you're running towards.

779
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,020
 Like think, we've all seen this,

780
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,580
 in case you're like, really, is it really that powerful?

781
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,960
 Think about some of the decisions that you made in life

782
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,140
 and how they were directly connected to who you were around.

783
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,500
 Like some of the decisions, like here's what I know.

784
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,180
 The first time you smoked pot

785
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,580
 was not in isolation totally by yourself.

786
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,660
 It wasn't one day where you're like, you know what?

787
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,000
 I feel like pot sounds good, let's try that out.

788
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,120
 Anybody, hey, pot.com, you know where I could get

789
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,960
 some of this?

790
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,900
 (audience laughing)

791
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,180
 No, you're around somebody at somebody's house

792
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,380
 and they're like, hey man, you wanna try?

793
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,720
 The first time you smoked a cigarette,

794
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,100
 probably the first time you drank alcohol.

795
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,520
 I mean, think about all the different decisions

796
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,220
 that you, the way that you formed your perspective

797
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,520
 on sex and relationships, all of it was directly formed

798
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,160
 by whoever you ran with.

799
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,540
 It can be incredibly powerful in a negative direction

800
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,880
 or incredibly powerful in a positive direction.

801
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,360
 That some of you, the reason why you ended up

802
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,040
 doing a Bible study is 'cause you were hanging out

803
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,180
 with a friend from work and they were like,

804
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,960
 hey, do you wanna do this with me this year?

805
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,280
 And you started doing that and God got ahold of your heart

806
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,240
 in a unique way.

807
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,640
 Others of you, the way that you date

808
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,960
 has been directly connected to the people around you

809
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,760
 because you've had wise guys or wise girls say,

810
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
 I don't think she's right for you.

811
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,520
 I don't think this is a good relationship for you to be in.

812
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,560
 And you made the decision, I'm getting out

813
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,740
 because I continue to hear that same thing

814
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,280
 from people in my life.

815
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,640
 I remember the first time that I heard somebody talk about,

816
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,040
 hey, I don't want to be addicted to pornography

817
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,600
 and so I'm gonna sign up for something

818
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,640
 called Covenant Eyes, which is this software

819
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,560
 and I'm gonna send it to you every single week.

820
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,280
 This was like 10 years ago for me.

821
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,880
 And he came over and he told me that at my house

822
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,640
 and you know what that created in me?

823
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,280
 A response that said, me too.

824
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,440
 I don't wanna look at this anymore.

825
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,300
 And we got on Covenant Eyes together.

826
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,680
 I don't know that I ever would have done that without him.

827
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,220
 10 years ago.

828
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,900
 And one of my closest friends to this day,

829
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,460
 who you run with is gonna for good or bad

830
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,460
 shape the direction that you are running towards.

831
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,020
 Are you running with the right people in your life?

832
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,380
 And Paul says, hey, I don't care how important,

833
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,760
 how many times you go under the porch,

834
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,560
 how important like God is to you,

835
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,740
 how good of a boy or girl your mama raised you to be.

836
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,340
 Bad company trumps that all day long.

837
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,260
 Are you running with the right people in your life?

838
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,400
 Here's what the right people in your life look like.

839
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,680
 People who are committed to God, committed to Christ,

840
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,880
 if they have that, they're gonna have these qualities

841
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,760
 because they're committed to Christ's word,

842
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,180
 the Bible, and living in line with it.

843
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,280
 When you find friends who are committed to Christ,

844
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,000
 they speak the truth in love.

845
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Ephesians chapter four verse 29 says.

846
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Like they wanna speak the truth to you,

847
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,400
 not to beat you over the head,

848
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,600
 but because they love you and do so in a loving way.

849
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,080
 They mourn with you when you mourn

850
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,060
 and they rejoice with you when you rejoice.

851
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,080
 Romans chapter 12 verse 15 says.

852
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,000
 They come alongside and when it's hard,

853
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,880
 they're there for you.

854
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,480
 When things are going great, they celebrate with you.

855
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,080
 They counsel you from God's word.

856
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,120
 Colossians chapter three verse 16.

857
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,600
 That they don't give you their opinion,

858
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,100
 like hey, I saw on Ellen the other day

859
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,280
 that maybe we should do this.

860
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,680
 That they say, I think God has something to say

861
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,640
 about this issue and they speak from God's word

862
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,940
 and counsel your life in that direction.

863
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,000
 They're willing to say hard truths

864
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,440
 that even if they think it's going to wound you,

865
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,320
 if it is something that you may not be aware of

866
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,280
 or in order to protect you,

867
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,240
 something you may not see,

868
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,760
 they're willing to call out blind spots.

869
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,740
 That's Proverbs chapter 27 verse six.

870
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,440
 I mean, this one alone is just so huge.

871
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,840
 I mean, you guys remember the show,

872
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,960
 is American Idol still on?

873
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,800
 It is?

874
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,620
 Is it back?

875
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,920
 Anyway, whether it's back or not,

876
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,960
 at one point in time, American Idol was a thing

877
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
 and if you watch that show,

878
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,000
 you know what I'm talking about

879
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,120
 where every single season,

880
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,560
 there were the people who could go on there

881
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,640
 and they could sing

882
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,280
 and then there were the people who could go on there

883
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,200
 and they could not.

884
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,840
 And you would watch and you would always think like,

885
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,600
 how has no one ever told you this before?

886
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,640
 Like how are you singing Gangnam Style right now

887
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,560
 in front of 30 million Americans

888
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,520
 and everyone is laughing at you right now?

889
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,520
 How did nobody in your entire life go,

890
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,960
 hey dude, you can't sing, bro.

891
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,840
 You do not need to be doing this.

892
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,440
 Are you really?

893
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
 Because they never had any faithful friend

894
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,280
 that was willing to say,

895
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,360
 hey man, we're going to find you like another hobby,

896
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,000
 like basket weaving or something

897
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,400
 and this is not really what I think you're called to do.

898
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,240
 How?

899
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,920
 And the same thing,

900
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,480
 tragically is true for a lot of us in the room.

901
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,280
 That you've never had a real friend in your life

902
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,400
 and you've been in one like messed up relationship

903
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,760
 after the next, after the next, after the next

904
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,880
 and like you get around people

905
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,400
 who are like actually truth tellers

906
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,280
 and you begin to describe your dating relationship

907
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,880
 and just how you always date these deadbeat jerk guys

908
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,480
 and one after the next

909
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,280
 and they were able to say,

910
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,480
 I think the common denominator is you.

911
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,040
 Has anyone ever told you that you may be the reason

912
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,280
 why you continue to be deadbeat guys?

913
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,040
 And you've never had anybody speak truth

914
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,880
 like that in your life.

915
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,640
 You've never had anybody willing to say like,

916
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,760
 hey, I think you need,

917
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,720
 I think you're bitter towards your dad.

918
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,280
 It feels like,

919
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,240
 it sounds like you may hold a grudge towards him.

920
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,080
 Am I right?

921
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
 Maybe I'm wrong,

922
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,760
 but willing to say,

923
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,280
 not what they want you to hear

924
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,440
 or not what they know that you want to hear.

925
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,160
 They're like, man, I love God and I love you

926
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
 more than I love what you think about me

927
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,440
 or more than I love what I want you to think about me

928
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,640
 and more than I need you to like me

929
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,080
 because I love you

930
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,440
 and if I'm obsessed with you liking me,

931
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,600
 I may not be able to love you

932
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,960
 if it means telling you something that's hard to hear.

933
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,800
 Do you have friends like that in your life?

934
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,120
 Friends that are committed to Christ

935
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,080
 will encourage you when you're faint hearted,

936
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,160
 when you're just, man, I'm just exhausted.

937
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,280
 They're generous towards you

938
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,560
 and your needs as a source of provision in your life

939
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,960
 that when you're financially in a hard place,

940
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,040
 they're coming around you,

941
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,260
 hoping to make ends meet, pay bills, cover things.

942
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,280
 They forgive you when you hurt them.

943
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,520
 Colossians chapter three, verse 13.

944
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,640
 Generous was Acts chapter two, verse 45.

945
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,280
 They forgive you when you hurt them as Christ forgave them.

946
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
 They don't hold onto grudges.

947
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,800
 They're not like you hurt me by Felicia,

948
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,240
 peace, I'm out of here.

949
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,120
 That they work through hurts with you.

950
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,000
 They work through conflict.

951
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,880
 Ephesians chapter four, verse three says,

952
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,440
 they're diligent to work through conflict.

953
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,520
 When you hurt them, they move towards you

954
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,880
 'cause they wanna see it resolved

955
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,720
 for the sake of being unified.

956
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,360
 Do you have relationships like that?

957
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,280
 By implication, the other thing that,

958
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,760
 takeaway from this is that it's not even

959
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,600
 just having the right relationships in your life,

960
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,200
 it is removing the wrong relationships from your life.

961
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,480
 And this next two minutes is gonna be the thing

962
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,560
 that some of you listen to

963
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
 and it's gonna change your life forever.

964
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,760
 Am I saying that there may be people in your life

965
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,720
 that you need to go and say,

966
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,680
 hey, I don't think we can hang out anymore.

967
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,160
 Like we can't hang out in the same way at least anymore.

968
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,400
 Yes.

969
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,960
 And I know you're going, dude, what are you saying?

970
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,800
 Are you kidding me?

971
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,640
 Like we're boys.

972
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,760
 You know how much we've been through?

973
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,240
 I mean, we've been through all types of stuff.

974
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,680
 I mean, this dude was here for me

975
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,240
 when I went through the darkest moments in my life.

976
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,920
 I mean, they've been in my life forever.

977
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,400
 You tell me I just need to ghost them and walk away?

978
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,800
 No, but I am telling them you need to sit them down

979
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,320
 and step away and have a conversation and say,

980
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,920
 if it's true, I'm not sure that we can be friends

981
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,560
 in the same way we have been.

982
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,800
 At least right now.

983
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,920
 Like I love taking them to lunch.

984
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,760
 You sit them down.

985
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,640
 You say, I feel like God is doing something in my life

986
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,600
 and I'm trying to focus on my relationship with him,

987
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,280
 which means I can't spend the weekend partying anymore.

988
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,800
 I'm not sure I can come to your bachelor party in a month.

989
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,200
 Like just the stuff that's gonna be there,

990
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,800
 I feel like it's gonna pull me down.

991
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,680
 And it's not because I think I'm better than you.

992
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,200
 I just think I'm better off following Jesus

993
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,040
 than I have been.

994
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,480
 And so this is the change I'm making right now.

995
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,000
 And so I still wanna spend time with you.

996
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,040
 I still love you.

997
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,760
 If you wanna come with me to small group to church,

998
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,880
 I wanna hang out with you.

999
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,480
 Just maybe not at happy hour and maybe not at the bar

1000
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
 and maybe not at the places that we have been,

1001
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,760
 at least right now.

1002
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,000
 You don't ghost, you don't just go radio silent.

1003
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,800
 You speak the truth in love.

1004
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,080
 And if you're thinking like, hey, what if they're like,

1005
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,760
 oh, oh, okay, really?

1006
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,080
 Oh, you can't go to the bar anymore?

1007
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,000
 What's up with that, dude?

1008
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,840
 You don't care about me?

1009
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,280
 Oh, you're so much better than me now since you found Jesus?

1010
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,280
 May I suggest that if someone only wants to hang out with you

1011
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,000
 if it involves alcohol,

1012
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,600
 maybe they're not as close of a friend as you think.

1013
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,880
 If someone only wants to hang out with you

1014
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,640
 if it involves whatever thing God says

1015
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,940
 shouldn't be in your life,

1016
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,680
 they may not be as close as you think.

1017
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,200
 But yes, the scripture does say,

1018
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,880
 you will walk with the right people

1019
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,580
 and have the type of relationships around you

1020
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,160
 where you live authentically in relationship with people

1021
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,520
 who are committed to Christ.

1022
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,240
 Some of you tonight is your night

1023
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,920
 and you're gonna take a step

1024
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,880
 that is gonna totally transform

1025
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,840
 who you're gonna be in 2030.

1026
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,040
 You're gonna go up the first step,

1027
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,280
 you're gonna take your first step,

1028
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,480
 you're gonna get plugged into a church,

1029
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,720
 you're gonna get into community

1030
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,480
 and you're gonna experience life change.

1031
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,160
 You're gonna experience more of what Jesus called you to be,

1032
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,000
 more who you were made to be.

1033
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,480
 Others of you are not gonna listen,

1034
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,820
 you're gonna continue in relationships

1035
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,500
 that are gonna continue pulling you down

1036
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,000
 and one day you're gonna wake up

1037
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,140
 and you're gonna remember this message

1038
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,160
 or maybe you're gonna have a friend

1039
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,680
 that invites you back again,

1040
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,720
 you're gonna be reminded that,

1041
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,160
 oh, God does love me, he hasn't forgotten me,

1042
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,760
 he wants me to experience life

1043
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,000
 and one of the ways that he designed that to be experienced

1044
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,840
 is through relationships with other Christians in my life

1045
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,040
 and that day you're gonna get it, hopefully.

1046
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,360
 Let me close by saying this.

1047
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,560
 If you could have a friendship or be in a relationship,

1048
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,720
 non-romantic one, with anybody on the planet,

1049
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,880
 I want you to just think to yourself,

1050
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,200
 who would I want to be friends with?

1051
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,040
 Like a person, anybody on the planet.

1052
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,400
 You could be friends with Justin Bieber,

1053
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,920
 you could be friends with Selena,

1054
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,560
 you could be friends with you-do-you,

1055
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,760
 whoever you would be excited about being friends with.

1056
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,360
 This would be the person, maybe it's a mentor,

1057
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,600
 Mark Cuban, I'd love, in the business world,

1058
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,160
 I'd love to have a friendship with this person.

1059
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,400
 Who would that person be?

1060
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,360
 If that person and the qualities

1061
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,760
 that make you want to be their friend

1062
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,800
 did not include the quality or the top of those qualities,

1063
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,880
 godliness, that they love Jesus,

1064
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,240
 they're someone that I admire in their walk with him,

1065
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,120
 they're someone who is a godly person,

1066
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,300
 who I want to have a relationship with

1067
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,380
 because every time I'm around them,

1068
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,720
 they make me want to be more like Jesus.

1069
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,440
 Your priorities are off or at least not biblical

1070
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,920
 and the god who's there wants you to have relationships

1071
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,560
 and they will show you your future.

1072
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,000
 Do you have the right ones?

1073
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,760
 If you're here and this is the first time,

1074
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,600
 maybe you've been back in church in a while

1075
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,320
 or maybe you are still trying to figure

1076
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,240
 this entire god thing or Jesus thing out,

1077
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,800
 here's what I want you to hear me say.

1078
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,520
 What you need to do is not take the first step

1079
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,840
 of going and getting into a small group,

1080
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,680
 you need to take a first step in responding to the god

1081
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,040
 who's already stepped towards you.

1082
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,680
 I asked the question, if you could be in a friendship

1083
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,280
 or relationship with anybody on the planet,

1084
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,120
 who would it be?

1085
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,040
 Do you know how God answered that question?

1086
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,840
 Do you know how God would answer that question?

1087
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,440
 Hey God, if you could be in a relationship

1088
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,520
 with anybody out there, who would it be?

1089
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,440
 You.

1090
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,960
 The god who's there, and listen to me,

1091
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,760
 the god who is there has not woven creation

1092
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,360
 into such a way where he's waiting for you

1093
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,640
 to work your way towards him,

1094
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,640
 that he wants you to strive and get your life together

1095
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,200
 and clean yourself up and stop doing that

1096
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,080
 and put yourself together,

1097
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,400
 and then you can have a relationship.

1098
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,520
 He's a god who so desperately wants to be

1099
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,560
 in a relationship with you,

1100
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,720
 he went to the furthest extent possible

1101
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,480
 by sending his own son to die in your place.

1102
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,480
 And he did so by paying for all the sin in your life,

1103
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,360
 every sin in my life, every sin inside of this room,

1104
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,760
 every sin that has ever been done by anyone listening,

1105
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,840
 whether you're there right now

1106
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,880
 or at some future date on the podcast,

1107
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,120
 every person, all of it, paid for,

1108
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,760
 because he wanted to have a relationship with you

1109
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,840
 because he answered that question.

1110
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,320
 Who would I want most? You.

1111
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,080
 And so many people have bought the lie

1112
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,840
 that the god who's there wants to rip them off,

1113
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,000
 he wants you to follow a bunch of rules,

1114
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,040
 you need to be in church a bunch,

1115
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,720
 you need to read your Bible X number of times,

1116
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,000
 and then you could have a relationship,

1117
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,840
 and it is a lie from hell.

1118
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,760
 God is so crazy about you,

1119
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
 he sent his own son to make a way

1120
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,880
 so that despite anything and everything you've ever done,

1121
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,200
 all the ways that you don't deserve to have a relationship,

1122
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,200
 you could have one, not by earning it,

1123
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
 but by accepting it, by saying,

1124
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,360
 I believe, I believe it's true.

1125
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,880
 God, you came, you reset the calendar, 2020 years,

1126
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,320
 you died in my place,

1127
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,880
 I don't think I'm good enough

1128
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,840
 to have a relationship with God.

1129
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,280
 I don't think I'm good enough to go to heaven,

1130
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,040
 but I believe that you paid for my sin

1131
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,720
 and you rose from the grave, you conquered death,

1132
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,200
 and I believe in that,

1133
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,240
 and I receive, if it's possible, that free gift,

1134
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,360
 and I'm not trusting in me, I'm trusting in you,

1135
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,200
 and that moment, that relationship that you were made for

1136
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,480
 begins, and every relationship in this earthly life

1137
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,440
 will fall short if it doesn't,

1138
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,840
 and is not grounded and founded on that relationship

1139
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,680
 with one another.

1140
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,720
 Let me pray.

1141
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,820
 Father, thank you.

1142
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,040
 That despite every way that we have tried to satisfy,

1143
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,320
 the loneliness, the aches,

1144
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:09,320
 the anger, the places in our soul

1145
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,880
 that are crying out for you,

1146
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:20,040
 and we try to fill them with sex, pleasure, or success,

1147
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,680
 despite all of that, you died in our place.

1148
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,840
 You gave your life

1149
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,840
 so that we would not just have good friendships here,

1150
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,920
 but we could be a friend of God forever.

1151
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,120
 And so, Father, I pray for anyone in this room

1152
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,080
 who's never received that free gift.

1153
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,560
 Your spirit would now do what only it can do,

1154
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,480
 and allow them to trust not in how good they are,

1155
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,540
 or bad they are, but in you.

1156
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,600
 I pray for people in this room

1157
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,000
 who don't have real relationships,

1158
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,880
 they're lonely, they're anxious,

1159
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,080
 they feel like no one cares, and they're afraid

1160
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,600
 of what if someone knew?

1161
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,360
 That you would break through the walls,

1162
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,760
 and you would move them just by your spirit

1163
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,520
 to take the next step,

1164
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,360
 whether that's opening up to their small group,

1165
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,200
 or getting plugged into a church, this one or another one.

1166
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,280
 Father, would you help us?

1167
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,320
 We are weak.

1168
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,080
 And we know that in our weakness, you are strong,

1169
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,760
 and you've given us community to encourage

1170
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,120
 and help one another.

1171
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,240
 Would we lean on that, and walk with others,

1172
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,800
 and experience all the life and a decade ahead of us

1173
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,640
 that roars through your provision

1174
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,120
 of the gift of the people of God?

1175
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,280
 In Christ's name, amen.
