[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.400]   - Hey, hey, Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.920]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.600]   Yeah, it is great to be with you.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.040]   I love my Porch friends, especially in the summer.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.060]   Hello, friends that are watching online.
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.480]   We are in the middle of a series,
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.300]   or maybe towards the end of a series called The Remnant,
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.140]   and we've been talking about things that are true.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.240]   My name is Todd, by the way.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.340]   I'm one of the guys that hangs out here at Watermark,
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.300]   and we're glad you're with us.
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.980]   But this series, The Remnant,
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.620]   we've been talking about what is left.
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.920]   The remnant is a word that comes from a French word
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.420]   from the 1500s that just basically means the remainder.
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.140]   All right, it's just exactly what it says.
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.260]   The remenoir is the word,
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.220]   and it means kind of what was left of a curtain.
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.060]   When you cut a curtain out of a big piece of cloth,
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.500]   what was left, the French said,
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.180]   is this is the remaining piece,
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.340]   the little remnant.
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220]   It means what is left over.
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.760]   What remains is how it came into English.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.040]   And so we've been talking about what should remain
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.480]   and what should be true of those
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.160]   who are gonna be faithful to the end.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.920]   We've been having a blast talking about
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.120]   the marks of the remnant.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.600]   Tonight I'm gonna give you four things, very simple.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.940]   And that is this, simply this.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.740]   The remnant sees what others do not see.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.640]   And the remnant shines when others are not shining.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.440]   And the remnant speaks when others will not speak.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.740]   And the remnant stands when others cannot stand.
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.260]   Now look, when we started to do this series
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.380]   and put it together, I was just like,
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.220]   man, I can't wait to have a moment
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.060]   to grab my friends and talk to them
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.700]   because what our country needs now is a remnant.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.980]   We need some individuals that are standing strong
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.160]   as the whole world drifts away
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.640]   from understanding an orthodoxy
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.200]   when we start to call good evil and evil good.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.480]   We need a remnant, people that are courageous
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.320]   and people that are strong and people of conviction.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.100]   Otherwise we're gonna be a whole world to hurt.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.880]   One guy a long time ago said this,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.880]   that it is the final sign of imbecility
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.920]   in the people that it calls cat's dogs
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.100]   and describes the sun as the moon.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.240]   I've talked about this here before.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   When somebody walks up to you and they look at a dog
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.320]   and they go, hey, we're gonna call that tail another leg.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.720]   And then they look at you and they say,
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.040]   so therefore how many legs does a dog have?
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.540]   Your response should be four.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.180]   I don't really care what you call that tail.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.440]   It's still got four legs.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.880]   And the remnant has got to be a group of people
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.360]   that stand courageously.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.200]   But we ought also be a people that understand
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.040]   why we can stand courageously.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   And we ought to be a people that understand
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.040]   what the remnant is and what the remnant does
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.320]   and how the remnant live.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.400]   And frankly how the remnant are ready to die.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.560]   That you would stiffen our spines
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.960]   and that you would show us things that are true.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.480]   Lord, I thank you that you're not just true,
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.040]   that you're good.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.120]   And when we begin to follow you in all the ways
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.560]   that you have told us to, it leads to blessing.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.800]   Father, we thank you that you're a God
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.280]   that doesn't wanna just call us to a way of life
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.920]   to show how strong you are.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.000]   You call us to something because you strongly love us
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.440]   and you want it to go well with us.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.040]   And it won't go well with us when we live victims of lies.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.760]   And so steal our hearts with truth.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.600]   Tune our hearts towards the grace of a loving father
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.320]   who wants us to flourish.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.560]   Let us be a remnant that causes human flourishing
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.360]   wherever we are in Jesus name, amen.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.600]   Well, that's what I wanna tell you about God
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.960]   is he wants you to flourish.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.920]   He wants you to be a blessed people.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.400]   He wants you to be a people that serve
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.200]   as a source of blessing to others.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.040]   But you won't ever flourish
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.600]   if you live according to false ideas, right?
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.120]   Ideas have consequences and bad ideas have victims.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.160]   Jesus said you should know the truth
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.560]   and the truth will set you free.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.600]   The scripture says false teachers
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.480]   come to steal, kill and destroy.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.880]   The father of lies wants you to go a different direction
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.520]   because he hates God and God loves you
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.840]   and so he wants to deceive you.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.160]   And you live in a land where more and more
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   truth is on trial.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.040]   And when you speak truth as the remnant,
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.480]   it's gonna sound like hate
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.380]   because truth always sounds like hate
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.580]   to those who hate the truth.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.320]   And so my prayer tonight is as a result of us
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.640]   hanging out together is that the remnant in this room
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.640]   sees things that they need to see,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.000]   shines and lives in a way that they need to live,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.920]   speaks things that they need to speak
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.640]   and stands strong all the way to the end
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.120]   because we don't know what's coming.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.040]   But what's great, we know what will come of us
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.800]   no matter what's coming in the world that we live in.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.640]   Let me just start with just a good reminder to us
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.400]   because people who know Jesus ought to be
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.440]   the most humble people on the face of the earth.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.440]   I think there's a mistake that's often made
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.000]   that sometimes individuals who have come to know who God is,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.040]   they think that they're smarter than others
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.280]   or the world thinks that we think we're better than others
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.400]   and that can never be the case.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.880]   We're individuals that God in his kindness
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.680]   has drawn out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.480]   There's a little verse in Matthew
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.000]   and it comes in Matthew chapter six
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.960]   and it's kind of an obscure verse.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's tucked around some other verses
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.880]   we're not gonna look at
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.160]   but I just wanna share this with you.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.280]   It's in Matthew chapter six, verse 22.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.280]   I'm gonna give you an illustration
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.600]   that will help you understand why we ought to be humble.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.240]   It says this, "The eye is the lamp of the body.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.800]   "So then if your eye is clear,
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.420]   "your whole body will be full of light.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.480]   "But if your eye is bad,
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.320]   "your whole body will be full of darkness.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.200]   "And if the light that is in you is darkness,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.880]   "how great is that darkness."
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.200]   And what this is basically talking about
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.040]   when Jesus says this
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.560]   'cause it's kind of confusing poetic language.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   But what he's saying here is how you view the world
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.120]   is gonna determine how you flourish
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.840]   or how you suffer in the world.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.180]   And if you perceive the world wrongly,
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.760]   if you don't have a lens that is clear,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.240]   you're not going to be able to have truth flood into you.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.160]   In other words, if the filter through which you process
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.660]   what you see in the world that you live in
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.500]   isn't a biblically informed,
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.800]   a theologically informed filter,
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.640]   then it's gonna make what's inside of you darkness.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.880]   And when the light that is in you is dark,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.560]   how great will the darkness be?
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.480]   I remember when I was a kid, I had a buddy,
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.040]   I used to go, we used to play catch at his house
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.480]   all the time.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.840]   And then one day, I got over there a little early,
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.660]   he wasn't there.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.760]   And so his younger brother and I went out.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.720]   And so, DeMarv, throw me that football up here, all right?
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.760]   So you guys know David, right?
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.920]   David's a great athlete, is he?
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.760]   Is he not?
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.580]   Come on up here, David.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.480]   Get that football and come on up here.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.760]   Stand over here with me, all right?
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.640]   David Marvin.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.240]   So we used to play catch, right?
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.640]   (audience cheering)
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.060]   And I was playing catch with this buddy's friend of mine,
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.900]   but here's the thing.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.640]   The first time that I started to play catch,
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.420]   move a little closer here into the light, David.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.840]   All right, and this is just very simple.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.740]   Here's what I want you to do,
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.240]   'cause I didn't know this about my buddy's friend.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.400]   But I had the football for the very first time
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.520]   and I went to throw it to him.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.960]   And so David, do me a favor, just put a hand over one eye.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.200]   Put it over, no, put your hand over one eye, all right?
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.040]   Now here, catch that.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.040]   No, here.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.320]   David, come here, come here, come here.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.160]   Hey, that was a bad pass.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160]   Put a hand over one eye.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.520]   Put a hand over one eye.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.080]   It's not that hard, catch that.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.520]   Catch that.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.640]   There you go, not bad, all right?
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.800]   He adjusted pretty quickly.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.600]   All right, put a hand over one eye.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.840]   Go ahead again, right there.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.560]   No, there you go, all right, get out of here.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.400]   All right, now look.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.320]   Was that, you okay?
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.160]   I'm sorry, man.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.320]   Come on, let's go.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   Now look, you look at Marvin, he's a good athlete, right?
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.700]   But all of a sudden, all right, you cover up one eye,
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.680]   just one eye, okay?
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.560]   And all of a sudden, all his depth perception
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.380]   was thrown off.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.840]   I put my football to my buddy's friend,
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.480]   actually brother, and I fired it at him,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.240]   and it just went, almost took his head off.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.080]   And I go, what in the world just happened?
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.120]   And I go, what's wrong with you?
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.480]   I kind of said that to him.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.640]   And then I realized that he had one eye that didn't work.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.240]   When he was younger, he and his brother one time
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.760]   were playing with a jump rope,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.080]   and actually his brother, they were stretching it out,
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.600]   his brother let go of the jump rope
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.480]   and had a little elasticity,
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.600]   and it came, and the end of it just stung one eye,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.720]   and it made him, in effect, completely blind
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.480]   in that one eye, you couldn't really tell it.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.360]   But all of a sudden, I was like,
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.560]   man, you're not uncoordinated.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.080]   I wasn't abusive towards him in my speech.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.800]   I realized he didn't have what I had
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.120]   as a result of no fault of his own.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.880]   It completely changed his ability to perceive things
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.360]   that came at him from a depth perception.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.920]   If you wanna, just a little bit later tonight, man,
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.640]   seriously, just across the table from somebody,
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.480]   you know, get something out,
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.040]   something that won't hurt somebody, right?
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.080]   And just about five feet away, cover one eye,
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.680]   and just toss it, and you'll say, whoa!
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.520]   If you're a good athlete like David, you can adjust.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.480]   This guy eventually learned to adjust a little bit
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.440]   and actually played high school baseball,
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.640]   if you can imagine that.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.560]   But it affects you when you don't take in things
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.820]   and see things correctly.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.880]   Let me just share this with you.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.860]   This is true.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.640]   The Bible in 1 Corinthians 26 and following,
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.400]   I just wanna read you some scripture, remnant.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.000]   It says this about people who understand
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.880]   and perceive who God is,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.760]   because this is the way we come to understand who God is.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.280]   You're not laying in bed one night,
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.960]   and you're going, oh, I believe there's a God.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.920]   He must be a holy, omnipotent, omniscient God.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.880]   He must be so good and so fine
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.120]   that there's no way you could ever earn your way to him.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.800]   And therefore, men, despite all his striving,
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.180]   could never sanctify himself in such a way
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.120]   that he could present himself before this holy God.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.160]   Therefore, there must be a time when God, in his kindness,
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.800]   would become found in the form of a man
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.840]   and taken in the form of a man
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.140]   and being in likeness of a man,
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.360]   even though he had no sin, he would go to a cross
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.000]   that God might pay a penal substitution
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.360]   to cover the sins of men, call atonement,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.800]   draw them to him, and allow them, by grace,
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.960]   through faith, to be redeemed.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.360]   You didn't sit in bed and figure that out.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.640]   God, in his kindness, revealed that story to you,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.680]   and even more than that, gave you a tenderness towards him.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.040]   1 Corinthians says this.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.900]   For consider your calling, remnant,
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.600]   that there were not many wise according to the flesh,
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.480]   not many mighty, not many noble,
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.440]   but God has chosen the foolish things of this world
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.240]   to shame the wise,
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.480]   and God has chosen the weak things of the world
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.040]   to shame the things which are strong,
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.640]   and the base things of the world,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.760]   and the despised, God has chosen the things that are not
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.620]   so that he might nullify the things that are,
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.120]   so that no man may boast before God.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.520]   But by doing, but by his doing, you are in Christ Jesus,
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.440]   who became to us wisdom from God,
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.720]   and righteousness, and then sanctification, and redemption,
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.120]   so it is written, let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.320]   And so when Paul would go to speak to people,
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.320]   he would start this way.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.560]   And when I go sometimes to speak,
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.760]   I've been all over the world to speak,
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.360]   and talk about the kindness of God for all men.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.840]   I make it really clear,
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.080]   hey, I'm not here to impart to you my own learning,
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.880]   I'm not here to impart to you, certainly, Western culture,
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.280]   I'm here to share with you the God of all men,
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.640]   who loves you and wants you to flourish in your culture.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.820]   I want you to know these truths.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.980]   So this is how Paul would start.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.600]   He would say, when I come to you, brethren,
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.080]   I don't come with superiority of speech, or of wisdom,
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.360]   but I'm proclaiming to you the testimony of God,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.800]   for I determined to know nothing among you except this,
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.880]   Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.840]   When I'm with you, I'm with you in weakness,
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.320]   and in fear, and in much trembling,
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.680]   and my message and my preaching
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.460]   are not in persuasive words of wisdom,
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.700]   but in demonstration of the spirit and of power,
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.480]   so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men,
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.320]   but on the power of God.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.980]   I'm just gonna tell you the story.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.180]   There's a God who loves you, and by the way,
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.860]   this is not just some myth and some fable.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.100]   God dared to do what no other world religious system
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.620]   has done, and that is to anchor his story.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.860]   Not just, there's historical figures.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.100]   Buddha was a real historical figure.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.300]   Leaders of Hinduism were real historical figures.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.440]   Leaders of Mormonism are real historical figures.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.340]   Muhammad was a real historical figure.
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.940]   But their writings and their revelation are nonsensical.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.500]   And what I mean by that is you can't test them
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.680]   and verify them in the context of the story
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.620]   that they're written.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.940]   They're descriptions of ideas and philosophies.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:37.060]   The Quran is beautiful poetry, but you can't test it.
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.540]   Like, you can test the scriptures.
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:44.700]   Was there a king called David?
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.700]   Was there a leader called Pilate,
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.120]   a pro-council called Pilate?
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.820]   Was there a man named Jesus?
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.820]   Was there an account of his crucifixion?
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.540]   Was there an account of his resurrection?
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.340]   And the answer is yes.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.840]   Not just by the eyewitnesses that are in scripture,
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.100]   which can't be discounted because they're reliable
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.100]   historical documents, but Tacitus, Secundus, Josephus.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.420]   Non-believers, non-followers testified
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.620]   to this miraculous event, which turned the world upside down.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.720]   Paul is saying, I'm just relaying to you
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.300]   what God in his kindness anchored in history.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.280]   And God in his kindness even pivots
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.000]   all of known human existence on the birth
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.680]   and the death of this individual.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.520]   Why?
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.400]   Because this individual matters.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.040]   And you do well to pay attention to him.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.760]   Paul says, all I'm gonna do is tell you the story.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.280]   And by the kindness of God, I've come to believe the story
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.880]   and it has changed me.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.400]   I'm no longer a religious person
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.560]   that's trying to make my way to heaven.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.320]   I am now somebody that realized that heaven
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.480]   in his kindness has made its way to me.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.080]   And I know that I am not perfect.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.480]   And I believe if God exists, he must be glorious and perfect.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.400]   And so it makes sense to me that no amount of human effort
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.760]   could ever build a resume that would be enough to please him.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.160]   And that's what the historical figure Jesus said.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.220]   You wanna have fellowship with me,
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.920]   then be perfect as I'm perfect.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:22.460]   I tell you, he says, unless your righteousness surpasses
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.360]   the most devoted people of the day,
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.800]   you're not gonna enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.920]   In fact, when Jesus was speaking
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.240]   to those most religious people, he says this to them.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.880]   In Matthew chapter 15, he's talking to them.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.900]   And watch this, because Jesus is gonna model for us
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.240]   one of the points a little bit later
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   about how the remnant, the genuine piece of cloth
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.640]   will speak the truth.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.200]   There were some Pharisees and some scribes
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.340]   that came to Jesus, and they said,
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.360]   "Why don't you do what we traditionally do
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.920]   "that makes us righteous?"
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.100]   And Jesus responds, he goes, "What makes you think
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.800]   "your traditions will make you holy in my sight?
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.000]   "Why do you transgress the commandments?
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.320]   "Because you say things like this,
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.860]   "honor your father and mother,
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.340]   "and you say things like, you know,
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.620]   "the commandment says he who speaks evil
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.880]   "of her father and mother is to be put to death.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.600]   "But you say, whoever says this to father and mother,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.460]   "whatever I have would help you,
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.420]   "but I've been giving it to God."
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.060]   And they came up with a system, basically,
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.400]   within their tradition that what we're going to do
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.020]   is leaders of the temple is,
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.660]   I'm not gonna support my mother and father,
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.180]   I'm going to give to the temple treasury,
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.940]   which, by the way, is my future savings account
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.740]   and that which I draw from to live by.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.220]   And so instead of taking care of their father and mother,
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.340]   these religious leaders said,
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.060]   "No, we have to give it to God, it's been sworn to God."
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.580]   So they wouldn't care for their immediate family,
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.620]   so in the name of religion,
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.300]   they could care more for themselves.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.880]   And he said, "This is not the way of God, you hypocrite.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.600]   "Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you."
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.740]   Listen to what Jesus says.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.400]   "You people honor me with your lips,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.980]   "but your heart is far from me.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.760]   "In vain do you say you exalt me,
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.560]   "because you teach as the doctrines of God
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.840]   "the precepts of men."
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.660]   Now, when the remnant speaks this way,
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.500]   I just wanna show you this,
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.500]   this is a little prequel to where we're going.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.340]   His disciples say, "Hey, man,
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.860]   "don't you know that when you said this,
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:16.300]   "that that offended the Pharisees right there in verse 12?
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.460]   "They didn't like it."
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.760]   And Jesus said, "Well, let me just tell you something.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.400]   "Every plant which my heavy father did not plant,
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.040]   "everything that's not rooted and grounded
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.600]   "in a faith relationship with God is gonna be uprooted."
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.760]   And he says this then, verse 14.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.920]   "Let them alone.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.380]   "They are blind guides of the blind.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.500]   "They don't see.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.000]   "And when a blind man leads a blind man,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.040]   "they both fall into a pit."
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.540]   And so Jesus is saying,
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.620]   "You better make sure that the ones you're following
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.920]   "are gonna really lead you to life indeed.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.340]   "And life indeed is not found
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.660]   "through the traditions of men and the ways of men.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.360]   "No, life indeed is found through the one who has come
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.940]   "to reconcile you to a holy God who said,
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.280]   "'I am God myself,' and I'm gonna demonstrate to you
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.440]   "what holiness looks like,
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.940]   "and I'm gonna demonstrate to you what love looks like,
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.600]   "because none of you are like me.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.760]   "And yet I'm going to take the punishment that is due you
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.480]   "so an infinitely holy and perfect God
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.960]   "who while he wants to love you has to be infinitely just
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.600]   "because God will never sacrifice one aspect
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.240]   "of his character for another."
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.800]   And so God has come not just to show love,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.140]   but to satisfy his own justice.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.980]   Jesus says, "I'm gonna go to the cross
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.120]   "for the glory of the Father, not just 'cause I love you,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.800]   "but because I love the righteousness of the Father,
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.380]   "and there's gonna be an infinitely perfect sacrifice
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.000]   "made for the Father so that the Father can then
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.740]   "in his kindness and justly offer life to you."
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.640]   It's called the gospel.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.640]   It's the good news, it's the great exchange.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.220]   That he made him who knew no sin to become sin
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.160]   on your behalf that you might become
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.680]   the righteousness of God in him.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.680]   That Jesus, though he was rich for your sake, became poor.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.080]   That through his poverty you might be made rich.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.560]   Some of you come from pharisaical backgrounds
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.800]   where you still think that what you do
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.640]   is what's gonna make you acceptable to God.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.880]   And God has gotta tune your hearts to grace.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.760]   And everybody's hearing my words tonight,
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.640]   but some of you have never believed
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.720]   that you need a savior.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.480]   Some of you have never abandoned your own will and way
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.360]   and said, "Todd, I'll take the savior Jesus Christ.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.640]   "I believe that there is one who has given his life for me
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.260]   "and that God declared with power that Jesus is Lord
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.820]   "by raising him from the dead."
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.360]   And by the way, you're not gonna just have
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.960]   the knowledge, okay, 'cause knowledge itself
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.400]   is not the same as seeing.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.880]   Seeing is a spiritual gift.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.400]   Men can get knowledge, but only the gift of seeing God
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.560]   and seeing that truth that knowledge talks about
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.960]   is for you, is a gift of God.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.600]   Jumping back to 1 Corinthians, Paul goes on and says,
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.240]   "I'm gonna speak this wisdom," in verse six,
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.720]   "not just to those who are mature.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.020]   "I'm gonna speak a wisdom not of this age,
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.380]   "but we speak God's wisdom."
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.980]   It's a mystery.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.860]   "The hidden wisdom which God predestined
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.240]   "before the ages to our glory."
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.540]   He's saying the story of Christ has been anticipated
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.760]   all through Scripture, but now it's being revealed.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.560]   "The wisdom which none of the rulers of this age
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.420]   "has understood, for if they had understood it,
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.920]   "they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.280]   But then he says this, quoting from the Old Testament,
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.000]   "Things which eye hasn't seen,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.640]   "things which ear hasn't heard,
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.640]   "things which don't even enter into the heart of men,
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.520]   "all that God has prepared for those who love him.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.160]   "For to us, God revealed them through the Spirit,
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.620]   "for the Spirit searches all things,
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.860]   "even the depths of God.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.660]   "For who among men knows the thoughts of a man
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.400]   "except the Spirit of a man which is in him?
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.040]   "Even so, the thoughts of God,
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.100]   "no one knows except the Spirit of God."
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.340]   And watch about these amazing words, remnant.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.060]   "Now we have received not the Spirit of the world,
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.640]   "but the Spirit who is from God,
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.520]   "so that we may know the things freely given to us by God,
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.780]   "which things we also speak,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.440]   "not in words taught by human wisdom,
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.880]   "but in those taught by the Spirit,
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.520]   "combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words."
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.080]   But watch this, natural man doesn't have the ability
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.620]   to perceive that, it's a gift of God.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.040]   Natural man does not accept the things
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.740]   of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness to him,
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.760]   and he cannot understand them
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.560]   because they are not spiritually appraised.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.480]   Now listen, whenever you talk like this,
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.620]   and you talk about the works that God is doing in grace,
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.460]   is some people go,
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.720]   "Well, how do I know I'm spiritually appraised?
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.080]   "How do I know that God wants me to know those things?"
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.920]   Here's the answer, all through Scripture,
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.260]   whenever God talks about what's called efficacious grace,
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.280]   what's ever called, what's ever meant by predestination,
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.280]   or divine calling, or election,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.000]   God is saying to all men everywhere,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.720]   "Come, I died for the sins of the world."
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.000]   But then he just says to everybody,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.360]   "Listen, no one can come unless you're called."
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.800]   And you might go, "Well, how do I know if I'm called?"
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.720]   The answer is come, come.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.000]   Come all who are weary and heavy laden,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.400]   come all who have experienced enough brokenness,
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.800]   and who are sick and tired of being sick and tired,
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.920]   who don't just wanna go and have a workspace religion
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.660]   where you attend spiritual services,
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.840]   but you know that if there is not a God
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.600]   who rescues you from sin and death,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.160]   and the Spirit inside of you,
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.720]   which has a strategy and a plan which seems right to you,
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.320]   but you know is not working out,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.040]   come all you who want a God who cares for you,
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   and loves you, and wants to instruct you
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.960]   in the way that you should go, come.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.800]   And when you come, it's like there's a huge banner here.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.600]   It says, "Come all you who are weary."
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.660]   And as you walk underneath it to the glory of God,
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.960]   into his marvelous light, and you turn around to thank him,
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.360]   you see in this side of the banner,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.360]   "Only those who by the grace of God have been called of him."
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.640]   And I'm gonna just tell you with absolute certainty,
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.320]   if you are part of the remnant,
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.340]   it's because of the grace of God.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.880]   It's not because you're smarter than anybody else,
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.280]   or better than anybody else.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.880]   And what I'm telling you, remnant,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.000]   is you ought to be the most humble people
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.960]   on the face of the earth.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.360]   And you ought to not ever look at somebody and go,
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.640]   "How could they do that?
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.580]   "You know, I don't do that."
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.560]   Last night I was here on Monday nights,
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.440]   we have this thing called regeneration.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.040]   And I always say this, the healthiest people at Watermark
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.300]   are folks that come to this thing on Monday night,
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.920]   because it's a place that folks are looking
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.980]   to deal with the brokenness that's in their life.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.020]   Some of it's physiological and psychological,
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.800]   some of it is chemical dependency,
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.880]   unhealthy emotional attachment to things or ideas
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.440]   or chemicals that have ruined their life.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:51.060]   Last night, I saw a guy standing there
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:51.900]   and not talking to anybody,
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.000]   so I just walked up, introduced myself to him.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.240]   And I said, "Man, how you doing?
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.080]   "Have you been here before?"
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.900]   He said, "No, I've never been here before."
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.740]   I said, "Well, welcome."
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.820]   He said, "Do you have any idea who I was?"
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.140]   I just said, "I'm so glad you're here."
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.860]   He goes, "Well, I'm not here for me, I'm here for my son."
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.980]   I go, "Fantastic, so where's your son?"
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.320]   He goes, "Well, he's in the restroom."
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.860]   And he goes, "My son's life is broken,
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.900]   "and I heard that he can get help here."
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:20.060]   His son was in his 20s, just like a lot of you,
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.980]   and when he came out, his son walked up literally like this,
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.660]   kind of sideways, and if I'm standing where that podium is,
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.100]   he kind of walked up like this.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.220]   His dad was standing right here, and I was there,
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.260]   and his name was Jeffrey.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.700]   I go, "Hey, hey, Jeffrey, how you doing?"
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.380]   And he just, he couldn't even look at me.
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.540]   He was just like, "I'm all right, I'm all right."
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.820]   And he kept doing this to me.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.420]   And you know, I just did this,
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.660]   and I eventually just moved around to where he was,
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.500]   and I got down.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.100]   I go, "Hey, Jeffrey, man, look at me."
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.680]   I go, "I have felt just like you,
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.920]   "where I couldn't lift my eyes up.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.380]   "I couldn't look at myself in a mirror.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.120]   "I certainly couldn't look at holy God.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.180]   "I didn't wanna look at anybody else."
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.000]   And I'm gonna tell you what,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.180]   this is what the Bible says about my God.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.540]   "Thou, O Lord, you're a shield around me.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.820]   "You're my glory, and you're the lifter of my head."
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.660]   "Jeffrey, look at me.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.740]   "Look at me, man, you're at the right place."
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:08.260]   God wants to lift you out of your guilt and shame.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.660]   He wants to tell you how much he loves you.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.940]   "Jeffrey, look at me.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.900]   "Jeffrey, God loves you,
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.360]   "not because of anything you're gonna do,
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.980]   "but because he's just that kind of good God,
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.680]   "and you're in the right place."
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.060]   Now, I have no idea if Jeffrey's gonna accept
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.900]   that offer of love,
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.120]   but I didn't look down on Jeffrey for a second,
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.640]   because when I say all the time,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.940]   and there with the grace of God go,
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.660]   I know that, man, I'm gonna tell you something.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.340]   Apart from Jesus Christ,
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.060]   I would ruin my life, ruin my wife's life.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.040]   My kids would hate me.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:41.880]   I'd be a porn addict.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.540]   I'd be an adulterer.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.020]   I'd be selfish and arrogant.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.420]   I'd be a danger to all who met me.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:55.020]   And yet the kindness of God has shown me
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.380]   how to flourish.
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.180]   And by the grace of God, that's not my story.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:05.480]   And it has nothing to do with me,
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.220]   except that God gave me a tender heart to believe him,
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.900]   trust him, and to test his ways.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.740]   I've got a buddy who said this to me,
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.140]   'cause he all but ruined his life,
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.640]   and he said, "I spent the last 10 years of my life
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.000]   "testing the warnings of God,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.620]   "and I found out that they are true.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.380]   "And I now purpose to spend the rest of my life
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.000]   "to test his promises."
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.520]   That was a guy that embezzled over six figures
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.240]   from a brother that he was working with.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.020]   That this morning I was away on a staff retreat
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.700]   with this man who's been so redeemed,
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.380]   he's now a leader in ministry,
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.660]   and I've watched him test the promises of God,
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.780]   and I've seen the flourishing that's come to his life,
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.440]   and I invite you to join us.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.260]   But let me just say this to you, remnant.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.340]   You ought to be the most humble people on earth.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.020]   That you have already seen
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.380]   what one day the world's gonna see.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.100]   That the clouds are gonna be rolled back like a scroll,
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.420]   and the King of kings who is raised from the dead,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.820]   who is sitting now at the right hand of God,
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.340]   who is God, is gonna return,
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.080]   immortal, as God only wise,
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.420]   and every knee will bow,
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.740]   and every tongue will confess,
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.020]   and what they will confess
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.720]   is what the remnant already sees.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.460]   And if you know that,
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:29.060]   you have a responsibility.
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.020]   What's the responsibility?
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.060]   The responsibility is this,
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.500]   the remnant shines when others are not.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.600]   This was God's plan from the very beginning.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.140]   In Deuteronomy chapter four,
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.060]   he says this to the nation that he chose
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.100]   from amongst the nations.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.760]   They were pagans like everybody else.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.300]   They had systems of righteousness
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.460]   that made sense to men like everybody else,
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.340]   and God chose to reveal himself to a group of people
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.140]   so those people could walk with him,
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.520]   and there would be such flourishing in their community
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.740]   that other nations would come to them and say,
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.220]   "Who are you people?
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.620]   "Who is your God?"
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.060]   And they wouldn't say, "We're better than you."
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.220]   They would say, "We want you to know our God
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.340]   "because our God is your God.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.360]   "He is the only God who created the heavens and the earth,
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.420]   "and he loves you,
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.560]   "and so we're gonna be kind to you."
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.280]   Deuteronomy four,
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.960]   "Now as you are listening to the statutes and the judgments
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.420]   "which I'm teaching you to perform,
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.120]   "so that," watch why God gives us statutes and judgments
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.240]   'cause he's the loving father,
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.960]   "so that you might live and go in and take possession
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.480]   "of the land which the Lord, your God of your fathers
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.320]   "is giving you.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.160]   "You shall not add to the word which I'm commanding you."
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.640]   Don't take away from it.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.640]   You can't make it better, don't make it worse.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.080]   Keep my commands.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.680]   Your eyes have seen what has happened
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.520]   to those who worship false gods,
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.240]   how God has destroyed the world,
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.960]   how God has destroyed people who trust in the wrong things,
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.560]   but you held fast to the Lord, your God.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.000]   You're alive today, every one of you,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.520]   you're living, you're full of life.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.000]   You've not been killed or destroyed.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.760]   See, I've taught you statutes and judgments
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.560]   just as the Lord, my God, commanded me.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.640]   This is Moses talking that you should do this in the land
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.960]   where you are entering to possess it.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.460]   So watch what he says in verse six.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.460]   "So keep them, remnant, and do them, remnant,
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.760]   "for that is wisdom,
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.340]   "and your understanding of the sight of the people
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.100]   "will hear all these statutes and say,
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.720]   "Surely this nation is a wise and understanding people."
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.480]   You see, why God wants you to live
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.640]   in subjection to his will and way
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.080]   is because when you live in subjection to his will and way
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.000]   and not influenced by the zeitgeist,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.360]   by the culture of the day,
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.880]   by the way of your college campuses,
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.960]   by the way of your workaday world,
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.760]   by the way of your materialistic city,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.320]   but when you live with an eye that understands this world
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.560]   and why there's trouble in it
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.840]   and why there's betrayal in it
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.300]   and why there's temptation in it,
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.020]   and when you live with the wisdom of God who cares for you,
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.900]   people look at you and they may not like what you say
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.300]   and they may curse you
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.420]   because you tell them they're accountable to a holy God,
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.940]   but they will go, "You are a wise and understanding people.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.180]   "Your marriages are better, your families are better,
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:06.180]   "your dating lives are better, you sleep better."
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:11.700]   There is truth in your lives.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.400]   This is 1 Peter 2:12.
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:19.620]   Keep your behavior excellent among those who don't know God
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.260]   so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.300]   because they say you know truth
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.060]   and that there's only one set of truth,
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.060]   they may because of the fruit of that truth in your life
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.260]   as they observe them,
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.660]   give glory to God on the day of visitation
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.460]   because they go, "God, we knew you were real
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.380]   "because we met people who say they knew you
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.900]   "and we saw them flourish."
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.540]   And so the remnant shines.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:52.300]   When Paul wrote a letter to a group of people
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.540]   who lived in a town called Philippi,
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.920]   he said this to them, he said,
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.120]   "Listen, man, don't do anything from selfishness
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.600]   "or empty conceit, but with humility of mind,
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.520]   "consider one another as more important than yourself.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.180]   "Don't merely look out for your own personal interests,
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.480]   "but also for the interests of others.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.980]   "Have in yourself the same attitude
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.140]   "which was in Christ Jesus."
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.100]   And it goes on, describes the life of Christ
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.920]   and it says, "He became obedient
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.760]   "even to the point of death, death at a cross.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.320]   "He gave himself away for others
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.580]   "because he was the perfect embodiment
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.980]   "of what God wanted man to look like.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.180]   "He was just like you.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.560]   "He was made in the likeness of a man
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.340]   "and he was found in appearance of a man,"
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.060]   it says in Philippians 2,
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.500]   "but he humbled himself."
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.260]   He didn't regard equality with God
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.540]   a thing to be held onto,
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.480]   but he said, "No, I'm gonna live as a man.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.180]   "I'm gonna take on the form of man.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.140]   "I'm gonna live as a man and I'm gonna trust God.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.780]   "I'm gonna walk according to his ways."
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.000]   And he walked according to his ways and he was glorious.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.700]   And because he was so glorious,
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.480]   God said he's gonna give him the name above all names,
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.960]   gave him the name above all names.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.760]   That one day at the name of Jesus, as I've already said,
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.560]   every knee will bow and every tongue will confess.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.920]   And then it picks it back up.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.220]   He says in verse 12, "So then," in light of Jesus,
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.520]   in light of the beauty of Jesus,
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.280]   "So then my beloved, just as you've always obeyed,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.160]   "not just in my presence only, but more in my absence,
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.340]   "continue to work out your salvation
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.820]   "with fear and trembling because you know it's at stake.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.820]   "What's at stake is the world knowing who Jesus is."
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.320]   Notice what he didn't say there.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.180]   He didn't say, "Therefore, my beloved brethren,
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:25.420]   "work for your salvation because the remnant knows
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.840]   "it can never earn a perfect God's love."
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.120]   It just says, "In light of the love of the perfect God,
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.320]   "make sure you walk with him.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.400]   "For it is now, if you have a relationship
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.860]   "with God and remnant, it is God at work in you,
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.600]   "both the will and the work for his good pleasure."
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.840]   What's God's good pleasure?
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.060]   That the world would see his goodness in you.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.720]   That you don't live for your own pleasure,
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.440]   you don't live for your own fame,
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.960]   you live for the good of others.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.960]   And they're gonna see in you the love of God.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.160]   And so whatever you do, you do all without grumbling
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.720]   or disputing, verse 14.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.040]   And then it says this in verse 15, "Watch, remnant,
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.120]   "because the remnant shines when others are not shining."
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.600]   He says, "Prove yourself to be blameless and innocent,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.860]   "not so you can be saved, but because you have
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.980]   "a relationship with a blameless and innocent God.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.040]   "You're childs of God, above reproach,
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.760]   "who live in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.440]   "among whom you appear as lights in the world.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.800]   "The remnant shines when others do not."
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.100]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:39.340]   If you were the only remnant on Earth,
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.380]   what would others think about the beauty
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.820]   of what your God creates?
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:50.100]   It is an amazing privilege to be somebody
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.860]   who gets to be God's ambassador,
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.500]   who gets to represent him to a watching world,
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.220]   who gets to say, "I used to live the way you did,
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.660]   "trusting in my flesh, following the course of this world,
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.620]   "listening to the deceptive spirits of the age.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.580]   "But now I know that there is a God who is good
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.180]   "and is true and who's loving,
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.220]   "who doesn't want me to perform anything for him,
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.400]   "but he calls me and invites me to walk
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.220]   "in the blessing of his way and to have understanding
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.400]   "about why there is hardship in the world.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.840]   "And so it is well with my soul.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:26.300]   "And I don't need to manipulate and abuse people.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.780]   "I'm not a slave to my fleshly lusts
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.300]   "which wage war against my own dignity.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.160]   "I don't have to cope with my pain
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.720]   "by numbing myself with medication or alcohol
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.000]   "or other substances.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.860]   "I can look myself in the mirror
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.500]   "and say by the grace of God,
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.480]   "the glory that he intended me as a male
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.180]   "or a woman to live in, I am living in.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.620]   "And God is kind because in all the ways that I don't,
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.920]   "his grace is sufficient for me."
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.660]   Remnant, do people see that in you?
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.340]   Do they see a humility in you?
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.620]   And do they see an attentiveness to his way?
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.420]   And are you bright and shining stars
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.760]   in the midst of a dark and perverse generation?
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.200]   Let me just throw this out to you
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.460]   because what do so many people say
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.800]   is the reason they don't believe in Jesus?
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.180]   They go, "Because his people are hypocrites."
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.780]   Let me just say something to you.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.760]   When you sin, you're not a hypocrite.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.000]   All of us, I've known Jesus for 30 plus years.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.880]   I still at times don't trust in the Lord with all my heart.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.200]   I don't not lean on my own understanding.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.060]   I do, I follow my own way.
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.400]   And in doing so, I'm not being faithful
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.520]   in that moment as God's remnant.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.000]   That doesn't make me a hypocrite.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.020]   A hypocrite is not somebody who says
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.140]   that these are mistakes and makes those mistakes.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.440]   A hypocrite is somebody who says these are mistakes
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.880]   and then when they make them says,
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.720]   "Well, they're not a mistake for me."
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.040]   Do you understand that?
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:57.840]   So remnant, we don't act like we don't sin.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.800]   When we sin, we go, "You know what?
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.500]   "That was me again.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.400]   "What you just saw, that flash of anger,
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:15.040]   "that surrender to lust, that insecurity,
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.880]   "that tendency towards people pleasing,
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.860]   "can I just tell you something?
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.040]   "That was me again.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.400]   "That was me not trusting in the kindness of my God
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.360]   "that I know His ways are right and true."
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.600]   It doesn't make you a hypocrite when you sin.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.640]   You're under judgment.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.480]   That's what it literally means.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.000]   Hippo, which means under, and kritos,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.280]   which means to judge.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.980]   Hypocrites, you're under judgment when you say,
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.680]   "That's wrong," and then you do it and go,
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.360]   "Well, it's not wrong for me."
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.360]   That's a hypocrite.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.880]   So one of the ways you shine,
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.400]   do you know what one of my greatest ministries is?
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.440]   You know, something I get to do to glorify God
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.800]   that Jesus never did
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:55.080]   is when I screw up, which Jesus never did,
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.340]   I get to own it, and I get to go to people
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.560]   and seek their forgiveness and restore the relationship
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.000]   and make amends, and I confess.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.680]   The word confess means to agree.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.340]   I agree, hey, that wasn't of God.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.680]   And I don't just go and just say, "Hey, I'm sorry."
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.520]   You know what?
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.340]   When you say, "I'm sorry,"
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.420]   you know what the right biblical response is
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.120]   when somebody screws up and goes, "Hey, I'm sorry."
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.760]   You know what you should say when somebody says that?
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.240]   You should go, "Well, I agree with you.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.880]   "That was a sorry thing to do."
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.800]   But I've made lots of sorrowful choices in my life,
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.400]   and man, if now that you've declared that you're sorry,
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.200]   that what you did is wrong,
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.800]   I've already in my heart forgiven you,
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.200]   but if you want that transaction to be completed,
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.160]   man, I'd love to forgive you, but just ask.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:47.040]   And that means when you screw up with somebody else
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:47.880]   and just go, "Hey, I'm sorry.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.040]   "That wasn't my best moment,"
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.400]   you need to say, "Guys, I need to ask your forgiveness."
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.500]   And you won't use this language,
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:54.340]   but what you're saying is,
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.760]   'cause I'm part of the remnant,
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.920]   that no God's ways are good,
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.420]   and just then I didn't do God's ways.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.800]   And I'm sure it hurt you and probably even confused you.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.720]   Will you forgive me?
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.160]   That's shining remnant.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.680]   The remnant sees what others can't see.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.760]   The remnant shines when others aren't shining,
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.360]   and the remnant speaks when others will not.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.400]   It's about to get tough, people.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.240]   You ready?
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.800]   Because this is what the remnant has to do.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.000]   We have got to continue to speak.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.160]   There is a problem in our culture today,
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.560]   and it's all around us.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.560]   I mean, you see it, like I told you at the very beginning.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.280]   It's the final sign of imbecility in people
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.120]   when they call cats dogs and describe the sun as the moon.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.000]   And you live in a day and age,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.320]   and what you're really seeing, what's happening right now,
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.240]   what I'm gonna call our transgender moment,
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.800]   and it's called a transgender moment
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.760]   because we're not gonna hang here long.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.320]   We can't hang here long.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   It is an unlivable world to say that gender is not binary,
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.720]   that it's a social construct.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.320]   But one of the things that is happening right now
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.520]   is your generation has been educated and taught
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.080]   that if you're loving, you're gonna let people do
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.160]   what they want to do, including to assign to themselves
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.960]   a gender that is inconsistent with their biological,
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.920]   God-given, glorious gender identity.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:25.760]   And it is not loving to enable people
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:31.080]   in their dysphoria and in their confusion.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.920]   You need to know something.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.600]   There was not a sudden surge of scientific understanding
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.360]   of this reality called gender dysphoria
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.680]   and how we should treat it, no.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.080]   This has been a progressive ideology of people
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.040]   who have come to steal, kill, and destroy,
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.680]   told by liars that are gonna tell you
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.280]   that gender identity is distinct
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   from bodily biological assignment,
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.840]   and that you can know that you're something different
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.560]   than what your biological assignment is,
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.240]   even at a young age, and that the most kind thing
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.920]   that you can do is to begin to give people hormones
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.080]   and therapy to help them pursue a different gender
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:07.960]   than they're assigned to.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.360]   And in fact, they're gonna tell you that preventing
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.240]   or delaying that transition can lead
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.120]   to really serious psychological harm,
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.240]   perhaps even inducing suicide in those people.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.400]   And I need to tell you something.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.240]   It's a lie.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:27.840]   Listen, tolerance in personal relationships is a virtue,
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.440]   but tolerance where truth is concerned is a travesty.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:35.160]   Despising people because they're not good and perfect
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.880]   is not good, but saying that everything is equally good
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.680]   and perfect is despicable and not loving.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:47.800]   And one of the things the remnant does
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.320]   is they don't confuse loving what others do
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.160]   with loving others.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.000]   They are kind, they are wise, they are a friend,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.040]   but they speak the truth.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.120]   Even if the world doesn't like it.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:04.680]   Guys, you need to know that for so long,
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.360]   what did you get on the remnant about?
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.080]   Like, oh, you remnant people, you're people of faith.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.240]   You're not about science, as if there's some contradiction
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.720]   between science and faith.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.240]   They go, I'm a reasonable person.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.000]   Well, the opposite of reason is not faith.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.720]   The opposite of reason is irrationality.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.880]   The opposite of faith is non-belief.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.960]   What's so interesting is for years,
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.920]   they came across the remnant and they said,
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.400]   you're just not scientific people.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.360]   And now, if there's anything that science is certain about
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.400]   is that this is a male and this is a female,
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.440]   they go, well, yeah, don't be so bigoted.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:44.720]   Because it has nothing to do, it never did with science.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.040]   It has everything to do with the desire
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.080]   to do what thou wilt.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:55.960]   And the remnant is not gonna be silent.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.200]   A remnant is gonna continue to speak.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.680]   A remnant is gonna do it in love.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.880]   Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.720]   but deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.760]   The remnant speaks when others will not.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:09.200]   And I'm gonna tell you, there was a lady
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.720]   by the name of Elizabeth Noel Newman.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.480]   Elizabeth Noel Newman was a Nazi propagandist.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.760]   She actually wrote for fascist newspapers
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:20.640]   and she advanced fascist ideology.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.000]   And once the war was over,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.280]   she made her way, actually became a professor
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.120]   in the States and she actually wrote a book in 1974
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.880]   called "The Spiral of Silence."
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.040]   And she admitted the errors of some of the ideology
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.320]   which she represented, but she said,
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.520]   "You need to know something.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.440]   "This is how a country gets like Germany."
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:45.280]   Edmund Burke said this centuries before Germany.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.920]   He said, "All that is required for evil to persist
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.640]   "is for good men to do nothing."
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:54.400]   The remnant are the good.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.320]   Elizabeth Noel Newman said,
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.840]   "What you do in the spiral of silence
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.920]   "is that you ridicule.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.600]   "Ridicule is one of our most potent weapons.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.480]   "We marginalize opponents.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.200]   "We personalize and polarize the target.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.880]   "We undermine their legitimacy.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.080]   "We make a certain group of people look stupid or evil.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.440]   "We call them anti-science, bigots, delusional.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.760]   "We mock them."
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.480]   What happens is we start to have progressive elites
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.760]   say things that are out there.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.640]   And most people will say,
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.600]   "Well, that doesn't really affect me."
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.640]   There's a famous phrase by somebody who said,
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.560]   "They came for the trade unionists,
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.680]   "and I didn't speak up 'cause I wasn't a trade unionist.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.600]   "They came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.520]   "because I wasn't a Catholic.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.680]   "They came for the homosexuals,
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.520]   "and I didn't speak up 'cause I wasn't a homosexual.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.440]   "They came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.480]   "because I wasn't a Jew.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.640]   "And then they came for me,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.880]   "but nobody spoke up 'cause nobody was left."
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:50.480]   And what loving people do
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.920]   is they see somebody else being oppressed.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:58.120]   And whether they're part of that oppressed group or not,
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.800]   if it's unjust and wrong, they speak up.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.880]   And even though they're part of the majority culture
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.840]   who's not being attacked,
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.520]   they go, "I'm not gonna let this power attack that person."
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.960]   And they might get thrown into the people being attacked,
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.200]   but most people won't do that.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   They take a, "Hey, this is not gonna affect me" mentality.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.760]   And what happens is over a period of time,
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.200]   people start to watch,
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.440]   and they don't wanna be out of step
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.560]   with what continues to be now
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.760]   the louder and louder and louder narrative.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:32.920]   Until finally, only one or two people speak up,
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.960]   and when they speak up, they are ridiculed,
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.800]   they're called stupid or evil,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.200]   they're polarized, they're attacked,
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.640]   and then everybody else goes, "Well, I'm not gonna speak up."
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.880]   And then when nobody speaks up,
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.800]   everybody else looks around and go,
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.520]   "You know, this doesn't look right to me,
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.240]   "but since nobody else is speaking up, I guess it's right."
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.160]   And the next thing you know, that spiral of silence,
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.000]   even though it started
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.620]   with a very small group of powerful people,
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.360]   it becomes the narrative of the land.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.440]   The remnant cannot let that be so.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.280]   The remnant speaks.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.380]   It's your job, it's your privilege.
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.880]   It's the most loving thing you can do.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.400]   Just to give you some science,
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.000]   I mean, if you don't understand what's going on,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.860]   I mean, Vanderbilt University did a study.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.920]   Given time, kids that are being told
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.400]   that if you're loving, you'll let yourself
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.000]   express yourself however you want,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.200]   which has never in the history of civilization
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.920]   been the narrative that you should let kids define reality.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:35.160]   But these kids that maybe are starting
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.200]   to feel stuff at a young age,
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.600]   probably because society's telling them
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.480]   that they should feel that way,
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.880]   and they're seeing all kinds of pictures
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:41.080]   of folks feeling that way,
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.800]   it says if you just let them alone,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.060]   80 to 95% of them will spontaneously reverse back
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.560]   to what is their biological gender.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:55.840]   They did a study in Sweden at the Karolinska Institute.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.760]   They looked at people who actually
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.160]   went through gender transition.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.280]   They followed over 30 years,
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.800]   324 people had sex reassignment surgery.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.400]   They found out that decades after their surgery,
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.960]   not only were they no happier
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.800]   than those who didn't make the transition,
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.960]   but they were 20 times more likely to take their life.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.260]   Folks, this is just one of the many examples
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.700]   where we go like, gosh, who am I to tell somebody
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.460]   that how they feel isn't right?
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.120]   Listen, I've said it a thousand times,
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.180]   feelings are real, they're not reliable.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.280]   You don't follow your heart, you inform your heart.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.260]   You don't conform yourself to the culture,
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.500]   you're transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.440]   so you don't do what seems right to man,
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.420]   but in the end, it leads to death.
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.720]   This is what God's Word says.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.920]   As he went to young Jeremiah and said,
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.080]   Jeremiah, I'm gonna call you,
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.260]   I'm gonna make you part of my remnant,
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.120]   you're gonna be a prophet,
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.520]   you're gonna bring forth truth because it's loving.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.080]   Jeremiah was not wild about the idea,
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.080]   but in verse 17 of Jeremiah chapter one, he says,
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.000]   Jeremiah, gird up your loins and arise.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.760]   You're the remnant.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.740]   Speak to them all which I command you.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.620]   Don't be dismayed before them, or I will dismay you.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.440]   Watch, remnant, this is your job.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.200]   Behold, I have made you today as a fortified city,
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.040]   as a pillar of iron, as walls of bronze
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.160]   against the whole land.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.520]   I want you to speak to kings,
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.880]   I want you to speak to princesses,
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.360]   I want you to speak to princes who will tell you
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.920]   every kind of crazy thing coming out of American pulpits.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.400]   I want you to speak to the people
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.700]   'cause you're the remnant.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:33.800]   The remnant speaks, but the remnant stands
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.240]   when others cannot, and the reason is for verse 19
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.080]   of that same little section where it says this.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.160]   Listen, you need to know something, remnant,
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.720]   they're gonna fight against you.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.620]   But they will not overcome you
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:46.880]   'cause truth is on your side.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.860]   God plus one is the majority.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.760]   The game is fixed.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.720]   Wisdom will vindicate itself by her deeds.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.680]   They will fight against you.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.340]   They will not overcome you,
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:02.200]   for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   When Jesus was talking to his disciples,
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.920]   you know, he said, listen, I'm gonna send you out
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.800]   as sheep among wolves.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.160]   Now, I don't know if you know much about sports mascots,
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.380]   okay, but you typically don't call yourself
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.560]   the New York bunnies, right?
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:23.060]   Or you're not the Dallas koala bears, right?
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:27.040]   You're not the St. Louis hamsters.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.120]   You typically don't take small creatures
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.400]   that are cuddly and warm, right,
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.560]   and make a mascot out of it.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.160]   So Jesus says, here's the deal, okay, guys,
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.680]   hey, we're gonna be the sheep, all right,
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.060]   and we're gonna be in competition
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.200]   day in and day out against the wolves.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.140]   Kind of like, hey, can we come up with a different mascot?
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:45.520]   Jesus says, no, you just need to know something, man.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.680]   You're sheep because you're gonna follow
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.360]   the shepherd's voice, and there are wolves
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.680]   that are out there, and you just need to know something.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:51.500]   I'm a good shepherd.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:52.680]   I'll give my life for the sheep.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.760]   I'm not telling you that there aren't gonna be some days
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.080]   that the wolves ravage the sheep.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.640]   I'm gonna let some of the sheep be led to slaughter,
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.760]   and when they die, they need to die a certain way
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.280]   with a certain confidence so that the wolves
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.800]   start to think, these sheep must know something
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.760]   that we don't know.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.720]   (laughs)
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.400]   1987, there's a movie that came out,
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.680]   The Princess Bride, you remember that movie?
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.840]   Who doesn't love it?
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.400]   Do you remember that scene when Inigo Montoya
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.280]   and Wesley were in a sword fight, right?
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.440]   I love it because they're sitting there,
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.940]   it all starts with, you know, they're up there,
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.540]   they're fighting, and Inigo says,
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.080]   you're using Benedi's defense on me,
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.320]   and he says, well, of course, it's only fitting
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.640]   given the rocking terrain, and then they go off
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.880]   a little bit more, and eventually Inigo says,
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.080]   you are wonderful, right?
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.780]   Wesley says, thank you, I've worked hard to become so.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.040]   And then what's Inigo say?
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.640]   He says, I admit it, you are better than I am.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.040]   And then Wesley says, then why are you smiling?
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.400]   And Inigo says, because I know something
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.240]   you don't know.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:48.240]   I am not left-handed, right?
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.120]   And then he fires the sword off to the other side,
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.800]   and so they keep fighting, and then after a little bit while
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.640]   Inigo says to the other guy, he says, you're amazing.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.920]   And he said, I ought to be after 20 years.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.160]   He said, but there's something I ought to tell you,
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.320]   I'm not left-handed either.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.520]   It's a great scene, I love it.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.760]   Why are you smiling?
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.240]   Because hey, this isn't my home, man.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.440]   And I get it that sometimes wolves eat sheep,
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.640]   but when you devour the sheep, I'm not done.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.880]   Watch, this is what Jesus told them right after he said,
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.320]   you're gonna be sheep amongst wolves.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.120]   In Matthew chapter 10, Jesus talking to his disciples,
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.000]   and he says this, starting in verse 24, he says,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:21.840]   guys, you need to know something,
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.560]   a disciple's not above his teacher.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.920]   It's enough for a disciple to become just like his teacher,
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.360]   because a slave like his master, if they've called me
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.760]   the head of the household of the devil,
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.800]   how much more will they malign the members?
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.320]   Therefore, though, don't fear them,
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.120]   for there is nothing that is concealed
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.400]   that will not be revealed or hidden that will not be known.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.200]   What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light,
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.320]   which you hear whispered in your ear,
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.840]   proclaiming among the housetops.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.800]   And I can tell you, in this situation,
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.720]   Jesus, I'm sure, is watching his disciples go,
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.840]   this is not gonna be pretty.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.840]   And I think in this moment, all right,
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.440]   little bit of, I'm gonna stick myself
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.400]   into the story a little bit.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.880]   I think Jesus went, hey, sheep, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.920]   don't lose heart.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.000]   I just told you it's gonna get nasty.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.800]   But don't fear them.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.360]   Because I'm gonna tell you something,
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.020]   you don't need to fear the one who's able to kill the body,
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.080]   but not the soul.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.640]   You'd rather feel the one that's able to destroy both body
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.400]   and who's gonna cast the soul and the body in hell forever.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.720]   That's me.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.720]   Don't fear him.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:33.680]   The remnant stands when nobody else stands.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:40.520]   One of my favorite stories is of a guy named Hugh Latimore.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.360]   Hugh Latimore was an English farmer, just a young man,
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.760]   but he became part of the remnant.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.200]   He was a remnant during the time of Henry VIII.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:54.200]   Henry VIII acted like a spiritual man,
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.240]   wanted to have a relationship with the church,
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.080]   but what Henry VIII wanted was to be his own king
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.880]   and not have God who was his king.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.760]   And so when Henry retired of his first wife,
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.800]   he wanted a second.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.880]   And he went through a whole charade
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.640]   to get his first marriage annulled.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.780]   He bought off priests that were not part of the remnant,
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.840]   but that were wolves in sheep's clothing.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:16.720]   And Henry's corruption became legendary,
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.040]   but praise God, there was a remnant
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.760]   in the form of an English farmer that stood up to him.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:27.560]   It was a New Year's day that Hugh Latimore
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.640]   was asked to come speak to Henry VIII,
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:34.640]   and his text in Hebrews 13, was this.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.240]   He said, "Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:44.200]   And then he taught from Luke chapter three,
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.720]   where he said that when John the Baptist came forth,
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:52.640]   he looked at people that went through a charade of baptism,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.080]   and he said, "You brood of vipers,
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.160]   "who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.320]   "Bear fruit in keeping with repentance."
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.880]   That same John, later, he told Henry VIII,
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.240]   stood before Herod, and he told Herod
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.720]   that his taking his brother's wife to be his own wife
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.480]   was not lawful.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.480]   It enraged the king.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:14.520]   And he demanded that Latimore repent
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.680]   of what he just said in the king's presence.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.440]   He said, "I'm gonna give you another chance
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.520]   "to stand before me."
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.280]   And when Latimore stood back before Henry VIII,
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.600]   he said this, "Hugh Latimore, does thou know
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.320]   "before whom thou art to speak this day?"
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.560]   He, in a sense, took third person.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.920]   "I am to speak to the high and mighty monarch,
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.520]   "the king's most excellent majesty,
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.680]   "who can take away thy life if he offends him.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.080]   "Therefore, Hugh, take heed that thou speak not a word
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.600]   "that might displease the king.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.560]   "And then consider well, Hugh, that if you do this,
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.600]   "when you come upon this message that you're sent to give,
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.840]   "that the great and mighty God might give you grace,
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.080]   "but this king surely won't give you grace.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.320]   "The one who beholds your ways presently,
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.720]   "this one who was able to kill you,
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.080]   "but Hugh, you stand and speak with the God
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.380]   "who is able not to destroy the body that that king can,
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.400]   "but cast the soul into hell wants you to do,
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.920]   "and you speak forth true to him."
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.480]   And he did that, the king went crazy.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.160]   It wasn't long before Hugh Latimore found himself
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.680]   tied to a stake about ready to get burned with his friend.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.640]   And when he walked to the stake to get burned,
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.720]   Hugh Latimore turned to his friend and he just said this.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   He said, "Nicholas, take heart, play the man,
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.580]   "because we shall this day light a candle
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.060]   "by God's grace in England,
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.840]   "as I trust shall never be put out."
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:41.120]   And then God's sheep was burned at the stake.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.700]   And it started a revival.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.820]   And it stiffened the spines of others
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.460]   because somebody did what the remnant should do,
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.540]   graciously but boldly.
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:59.860]   Look guys, I don't know where this thing is headed.
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:03.300]   I heard a guy say this one time, he said,
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.840]   "I think I'm gonna probably die in my shame
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.300]   "because I'm gonna be criticized and called intolerant
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:10.400]   "and called old fashioned and out of step with the times.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.900]   "I think my successor will probably die in chains,
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.660]   "and I think his successor will probably die in flames."
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:21.020]   But mark my word, his successor will pick up the ashes
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.940]   and will restore a godly generation.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:32.500]   The remnant should be humble because it sees things
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:34.380]   that only God can let them see.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.740]   The remnant should shine because they live in a way
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.780]   that only people who are associated with a holy God
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:43.180]   can shine, the way they date, the way they suffer,
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.580]   the way they speak, the way they love.
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.100]   The remnant speaks.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:51.500]   And the remnant stands firm because it knows
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.180]   that even if they're burned at the stake,
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.660]   to die is gain.
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:03.260]   Paul said, "It's better for you if I remain.
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.540]   "But if you wanna send me to glory, send me to glory.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.740]   "But while I'm here, I will live for the glory of my king
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.180]   "who lived and died for me."
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:14.220]   Can I tell you, I'll just close with this.
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:16.220]   I buried a friend who was a graduate
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.780]   of the Naval Academy on Friday.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.480]   And at the end of the wedding,
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:25.060]   I do that all the time, I call funerals weddings
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:28.540]   because that's exactly what it is for believers.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.260]   It's your homecoming, man, your bridegroom's ready.
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:32.820]   At the end of the funeral,
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:36.860]   they played a song that I'm about to play for you,
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.940]   and there was in that room a bunch of Navy SEALs.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.940]   A bunch of others that had graduated from the Academy.
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:47.740]   And when the song started, it's the Navy alma mater
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:50.380]   that if you're a graduate of Annapolis, you sing.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:54.740]   And they all got up, and there's about 10 of those men
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.540]   that came and stood around the bride.
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:01.180]   And I remember looking at those guys,
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.180]   and one of my great regrets in life
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:07.300]   is that I didn't, I didn't know what to do.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.300]   And one of the great regrets in life
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.700]   is that I didn't serve our country
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:16.220]   the way godly and faithful, strong men serve our country,
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:17.740]   strong women serve our country.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.140]   I never had that as part of my story.
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:22.080]   And I remember sitting there longing to be a guy
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.100]   that could have stood up with those Navy SEALs
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:28.540]   and those midshipmen that had sacrificed by the sea
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:31.380]   to be trained to sail on waters and defeat evil.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:35.540]   I want you to put yourself back in that funeral for a second
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.460]   and then I close with the last statements.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.700]   But this song was played,
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.880]   and imagine getting to stand up when it was done.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.720]   Watch this.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:46.260]   Something just haunting about the Navy Glee Club
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:47.700]   when they sing that, it just makes you,
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.060]   I saw those men stand behind that widow.
[00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:52.180]   And I thought to myself,
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.780]   I serve in a much more noble army than that.
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:59.300]   And as much as I would have wanted
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.100]   to be through some of the tours,
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:02.780]   to do that those guys were in the Philippines
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:05.180]   and Afghanistan and on all the seas,
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.700]   I thought to myself, nope, right now,
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.700]   I'm part of the remnant, man.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.460]   I am serving something even more noble than that.
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:16.540]   And when my king at the end of the day is worshiped
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:21.420]   and the alma mater of the remnant is sung, I will stand.
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:24.500]   And by the grace of God, as I walk with him,
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.320]   as a soldier who doesn't entangle himself
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.660]   in the affairs of everyday life
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:28.980]   in order that I might please the one
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:31.700]   that enlisted me as a soldier, I will stand.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:34.300]   And I will be glad that by the grace of God I have seen,
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.780]   that by the grace of God I served.
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:41.460]   By the grace of God I spoke in a winsome way
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.580]   with my speech seasoned with salt as it was,
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.040]   and I stood firm.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.540]   And if I die in flames,
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:50.300]   I pray that God will use it to light a candle
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.860]   that the entire world will see.
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:57.220]   There is nothing more noble than being the remnant,
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.780]   when the remnant serves the kind and benevolent
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.900]   and true all powerful king.
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:07.300]   This world needs a remnant.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:13.580]   It is calling cats, dogs, girls, boys, and lies truth.
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:20.540]   And humans do not flourish under lies.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.300]   If you by the grace of God have come to know the truth,
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.020]   live as if you know the truth.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:31.860]   Speak gently but courageously before any king.
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:34.820]   Because you stand firm for yours.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.780]   Let's go.
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:40.060]   Father, I pray we'd be the remnant.
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:41.860]   I pray if there's any in here tonight
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:46.860]   that has had a confusing understanding
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:49.060]   about what it is that you want from us.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.900]   If they've been confused to think
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:53.660]   that they've got to serve long and nobly
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.340]   in order to possibly be admitted into your family,
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:59.220]   I pray that you would shake them out of that
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:02.660]   and understand that all you do is call broken sinners
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:04.300]   and just say, "Are you sick and tired of drowning
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.020]   "in the sea of human despair?
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:07.340]   "Then come to me.
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:10.380]   "And I will restore the glory that is lost.
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.100]   "I will make beauty from your ashes.
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.780]   "I'll make you my remnant.
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.940]   "I'll call you out of darkness into my marvelous light.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:18.340]   "And I'll make you as a shining star
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.500]   "in the midst of a dark and perverse generation.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.460]   "I'll put in you a heart of courage.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.820]   "I'll put in your lips words that are true.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:28.740]   "I will clothe you in dignity and honor and compassion
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.300]   "and kindness and boldness.
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.940]   "I will give you the ability to take heart
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:37.320]   "in the midst of those that seek our life
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.620]   "because you know that this world is not your home."
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:42.300]   Oh, Father, what a privilege
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:45.500]   that grace would enlist us in your family.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.180]   And what a privilege to be shepherded by you as your sheep.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:55.340]   Would you help us not just to sing songs,
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:58.400]   but to have our heart filled with the spirit of truth,
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.200]   that we might be a remnant indeed
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.100]   for the glory of our King until he comes.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.180]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.180]   Let's stand together.
