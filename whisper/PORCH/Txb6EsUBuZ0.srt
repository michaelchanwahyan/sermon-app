00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Well, hello, Fortrans! How are we doing?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Yeah, it's good to say hello to my friends in Dallas and Fort Worth, Houston, Joplin, Tulsa, wherever you guys are watching from online.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 It is great to be with you. I'm Todd.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I get to hang out here at Water War from my friends JP and Dmarv and others, so it's awesome to be here.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 We are in a series called "The Afterlife," and we've been talking about what is on the other side.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 There's a lot of speculation. The first week we talked about this horrible thing called "hell,"

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 and if when you talk about hell, it doesn't bring you a great deal of just sadness

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 and an overwhelming sense of almost a burden, then you really haven't talked about hell.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 There's such a misconception about that topic.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Like, you know, I hear friends say all the time, "Well, I might be going to hell, but at least I'll be there with my friends."

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 First of all, I'd say you ought to rethink who your friends are, rethink that whole thing.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And secondly, what I would just say is, no, no, no, no, you need to understand,

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 hell is a place where there is nothing there that would even remotely remind you of a kind and gracious God,

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 and that would include friends.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And if you think, "Well, man, at least there'll be good music and sex, drugs, and rock and roll,

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 we'll just get after it all day long," let me tell you something, sex is a gift from God.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 You can scratch that off your hell list of things to do.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Music, it's a gift of God. Read your Bible. God's the one who gave it.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Scratch that off of the things you might do to chill while you're in hell.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Hell is a place where it can best be defined, as we said two weeks ago, as the ultimate FOMO.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 You're going to not just have a fear of missing out, you're going to miss out eternally,

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 because there will be nothing there that will ever remind you of the kindness and goodness of God.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 There's two kinds of people in the world, those that will say to God at this particular moment,

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 "God, your will be done," and those that God one day will say to them, "Hey, your will be done.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 You don't want me, even though my prevailing general grace was available to you and over you and around you,

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 even though the world that you were in, I told you why it was a mess and what I did to rescue you from it

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 and to give you hope in the midst of it, you don't want anything to do with me,

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I will grant you your request. I will put you someplace where nothing will ever remind me of you again."

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 That's why it's even eternal, because you would love nothing more than just to eradicate life

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 and to go to sleep forever. Hell does not involve sleep, it doesn't involve death.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 It involves nothing but darkness and everything that is antithesis of God.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And if you can talk about God without just a real...

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 If you can talk about hell without a real sobriety, you haven't really understood hell.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I will tell you this. People ask me all the time, "What do you think, Todd, is the number one thing

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 you're going to want to ask God when you get to heaven?"

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And I'm not really sure what the number one thing I'm going to ask Him about

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 that I didn't really know when I was here. I know there's a ton.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Obviously, we'd all love to ask Him, but I can assure you there's one thing I'll have a problem with in heaven

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 if God doesn't let me see Him for who He really is, and that's going to be the idea of hell.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 If I don't get my arms around the eternality of God, the love of God, the reality of who He is,

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 when I get to heaven, I'm going to have a real problem with hell.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And I can take it by faith right now why it's there, and I've taught on this before,

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 like JP did a couple of weeks ago, but let me just say this.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Hell is not something we should joke about or delight in.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 It's something that we should, in understanding, be grateful that God has delivered us from,

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 because that's all of our destiny apart from grace.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And we should do everything we can to help people understand the opportunity that God's given us

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 to get out of it. Heaven, on the other hand, is just the opposite.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 As we talked last week, the best way for you to understand heaven is when the Bible talks about it,

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 having roads paved with gold. We kill for gold here.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Gold is the one form of currency that has survived almost every civilization that has ever lived.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 The things that men go to war over and fight to attain and have, you'll walk on it in heaven.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I'm not really sure you're going to get there and the streets will have gold instead of asphalt,

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 but that's the best that a writer could do with the words that he had to describe the glory of what awaits us.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Heaven's not a place that's up there. It's the earth restored in all the ways that God intended.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 It's when God will be with us again, not by faith, but by sight.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 It'll be an amazing thing. We'll love. You and I will be friends without sin.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And if grace gets us there, grace will sustain us and we'll get to experience the kingdom as God intended it.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Heaven is everything on earth fully and completely and actually realized.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And is there sex?

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I did this little thing called Real Truth real quick.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I actually did one called, "Will there be sex in heaven?" Check it out.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 You might be kind of curious on why there was or what, but let me just say this to you,

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 because right now you're kind of like, "Man, there better be." Right?

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Because if you didn't know, Ty, this is largely a single crowd and we're trying to be chased.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And so if we happen to go home before we get married and we're waiting, it better be there on the other side,

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 because word is it's all right. You know?

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So let me just tell you, it's all right. Okay?

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 As a guy who's enjoying the beauty of that in the married world, let me just say this.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 It's kind of like, listen, I'll say it to you this.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 It's kind of like when you talk to a five-year-old about what heaven might be like. All right?

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And he goes, "What's it like? Is it like a candy store where there's all the bubble gum?

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Is that what it's like as you get older? Is heaven going to have bubble gum and all the chocolate I could ever eat?"

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Like if you tell a kid, "I don't know, man. I'm not sure there's going to be ice cream or bubble gum in heaven."

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 That kid's like, "Well, I'm out. I'm out."

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Because to a five-year-old, the only thing that would make sense to him being eternally worth pursuing is a place with lots of bubble gum and ice cream.

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 But as you get older, you're like, "Man, I hope it ain't just bubble gum and ice cream." Right?

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I think there's a little of that. Go check it out. You'll see some more of that.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 But heaven is everything you've ever wanted, and it's amazing.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And here's the question. What do we do?

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 By the kindness of God, we've escaped the judgment. Do us.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 What do we do with the reality of our understanding of the grace of God that helps us avoid the judgment that all of us who are separated from God, that are a downline of sinners, all of us are born into sin.

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 We all come from moms and dads, every single one of us, that are rebels against God, and we do a good job of kind of continuing the family business.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And every single one of us has got to get to a place where we deal with our sin that's innate in us.

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And God, in His grace, makes it known to us.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And so what do we do? Do we just hang around and wait? Do we get to go to heaven while we kind of endure this less than God's ideal on earth?

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And why are you holding a stick? Okay, so let's talk about these things.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 There's a story I want to share with you that goes with the stick.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 It's told of a guy that was a very wealthy man, a very wise man. He had many servants.

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And he had one servant that couldn't do anything right. He was just a fool.

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 He was just the dumbest guy he ever met.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And he just, one day, out of exasperation with this fool, he said, "Man, you are such a fool. I've never met anybody else like you. I'll tell you what. Here, hold this stick.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And I want you to hold on to this stick until you meet a bigger fool than you."

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And so this servant got this stick. And, you know, I mean, whether he was just humble or he really was as dumb as the master had, in his exasperation, declared him to be,

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 he carried this stick around with him everywhere. He always had this stick his entire life.

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And yet, in kind of a strange way that we often do, this foolish servant who just couldn't seem to get anything right,

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 there was a soft spot in his master's heart about him.

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And so as the master aged and eventually was about to die, the master summoned all of his servants and said, "Go and go meet the fool."

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 The guy with the stick, does he still have the stick? "Oh, he's still got the stick. Well, bring the stick-carrying fool in here."

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And so he walks in. He sees his master there, and he's just at the end of his life.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And the master knew he was a fool, so he couldn't really explain even death to him.

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And so he just said, "I just want to let you know I'm leaving."

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And the fool goes, "Well, master, where are you going? What will we do without you here? Just listen to me."

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 He said, "I'm going on a journey." He said, "Well, master, where's the journey? Where are you going to go?"

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 "Well, I don't know where I'm going."

107
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 "Well, master, you're a wise man. You're educated. What do you mean you don't know where you're going?

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 What king will you meet when you get there?" He goes, "I don't know who the king is in the land that I'm going to."

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 He goes, "You don't know? What do you need, master, to be successful on your journey?"

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 He goes, "I don't know what I need, really, frankly."

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 He goes, "Master, how long have you known you were going to go on this journey?"

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 "Well, I've known my entire life."

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And the fool said, "Master, do you mean to tell me that you knew that you were going on a journey your entire life,

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 that you didn't prepare for that journey, you didn't know what you needed to take with you on that journey to be successful,

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 and you didn't know who the king was and the ruler was of the land that you were going to,

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 and how you might be at peace with him? Master, you're stick."

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 (Laughter)

118
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Don't take it personally, okay?

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 But you think about that, and you're kind of like, "Hey, that is kind of crazy, isn't it?"

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I mean, this is something, I don't know if you guys have noticed, but the statistics for death are rather impressive.

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 For every person that's born, that person dies. It's kind of like, you better begin to deal with it.

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I mean, it's tax day, okay, if you're watching this in the future, and what do we say?

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 I mean, there's not very many things in life that are certain, but certainly death and taxes are certain,

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 and we know they're coming. You may not have done your taxes, and you can delay, ultimately, that thing coming,

125
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 and pay them a little bit later, but you're not going to avoid the day.

126
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And what do we do in light of that we know the fact that the day is coming?

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Let me tell you, one of my favorite places to go in Scripture, I hardly can talk to this crowd without looking at it,

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 is in Ecclesiastes chapter 7, and then also in 12, and we're going to go there rather quickly,

129
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 and we'll bounce to other places in just a moment, but let's take a look at these verses.

130
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 In Ecclesiastes chapter 7, 1 and 2, we kind of have the master of the story that I told at the very beginning,

131
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 the wisest man that ever lived, the wealthiest man that ever lived. Solomon, I love to describe this way.

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 He is the guy that ran out of mirages before he ran out of money. What do I mean by that?

133
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Solomon was the guy that had the resources to chase after everything that looked life-giving,

134
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 and he never ran out of enough resources to chase the next thing, when the thing that he was chasing didn't provide for him what he wanted.

135
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 He is the Old Testament's rich young ruler. Now let me just remind you this, before I even read from Ecclesiastes chapter 7,

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 let me tell you what's unique about the rich young ruler.

137
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 The rich young ruler is the guy that shows up in your New Testament that has an interaction with Jesus,

138
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 and this is a rich, powerful, has-it-made guy, and the question that he asks Jesus is telling.

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 He says in Matthew 19 to Jesus, he says, "Hey, what good thing shall I do that I might obtain?"

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And he uses the word "eternal life."

141
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Now that word "eternal" is a couple of different words in the original language that are translated "eternal" or "abundant,"

142
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 but this particular word means basically this.

143
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 What he said is, "Jesus, what must I have that I can have enduring life?"

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Now what he means there is not just so that I can have life after the grave.

145
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 I think what he's saying is, "I've got everything a man could want, and yet, like Solomon is about to show you,

146
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 I don't have what every man wants, which is some sense of satisfaction, some sense of peace.

147
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I have all that most of these people around you are seeking, and yet I don't perceive I have what they have."

148
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And so, good teacher, what am I lacking?

149
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 What do I need to do that I can have life indeed, is what he's asking for.

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Not just life at the grave, but life right now.

151
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 In fact, this is what Jesus says in John chapter 10, verse 10.

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It's a very familiar verse.

153
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 It just says this, "The thief, the liar, he comes to steal and to kill and to destroy."

154
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 But Jesus says, "I'm here that you might have life and that you might have it abundantly."

155
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 What Jesus is saying right there is, "I want you to have life to its fullest."

156
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Life that is exceedingly, abundantly, beyond anything that you will get pursuing anything else but me.

157
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And when God doesn't offer people life apart from him, it's not because he's mean, it's because he can't.

158
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Life doesn't exist apart from him.

159
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And since men have chosen not to follow God, but to go their own way,

160
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 they're not experiencing what it is they ultimately long for.

161
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And there is this sense of haunting, this sense of emptiness.

162
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And we cry out what Bono, right, sings.

163
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 "I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

164
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 What must I do that I might have this enduring sense of life?"

165
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 In 1 Timothy, we're told to have nothing to do with worldly fables.

166
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Fit only for old women, have nothing better to do but just chit-chat about old stories and where life might come from.

167
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 But on the other hand, it says, "Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness."

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Because bodily discipline is of little profit.

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 There's nothing wrong with taking care of the body you have.

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It's the only body you have on this journey until you get home.

171
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 But godliness is profitable for all things since it holds promise for the present life, watch this,

172
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 and also for the life that is to come.

173
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 When you pursue the good way, as Jeremiah wrote about when he was watching the people of Israel

174
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 that had left God and had given themselves away to all kinds of idolatry,

175
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Jeremiah, speaking for God in chapter 6, verse 16, he just basically says,

176
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 "Hey, listen," it says, "Come back, pay attention to the ancient past

177
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 where the good way is and walk in it and then you will find rest for your souls."

178
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 This old proven way, the way that leads to life indeed.

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 You'll never find it by pursuing just riches on this earth or all that this world has.

180
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 But if you want to have extraordinary, more than usual, abundant life,

181
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 you're going to find that in God's way.

182
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Listen to me, folks. This is so important for you as you walk through.

183
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 You need life, you need to understand God gives you commandments

184
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 so that you can experience blessing.

185
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 The very first words that God spoke to humankind in the history of the world were a commandment.

186
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 It says, "God blessed them and said to them, 'Do this.'"

187
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Now watch, what he's saying is not, "If you do this, I will bless you."

188
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 He's saying, "I'm going to bless you. I'm going to tell you where life indeed is."

189
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 This is the thing. Heaven is more a person than it is a place.

190
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And when you are in the presence of God, when you walk with the ancient of days,

191
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 you walk according to the ancient past where the good way is,

192
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 and you walk with him and it gives you rest for your souls.

193
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 God isn't mad at you because you're sleeping with one another

194
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 and swiping left and swiping right and just trying to find life

195
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 in all the ways that the world sells you.

196
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 We understand. I mean, I understand the world is selling me.

197
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 God's not mad at us and judging us because we pursue life in other areas.

198
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 The things that we pursue that are false gods, that aren't enduring life,

199
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 are the judgment.

200
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 We find ourselves having, like the rich young ruler, fleeting moments of satisfaction,

201
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 vacation, and buzzes and highs, but the buzz always ends.

202
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 The intense pleasure isn't enough.

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 The fleeting validation from another human being doesn't satisfy our soul.

204
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And this is what it says in the scripture. It says in Proverbs chapter 19,

205
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 it says, "It's not good for men to be without knowledge."

206
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 It says, "He who makes haste with his feet errs."

207
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And then it says, "When men suffers of the consequence of that,"

208
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 it says, "their heart rages against God."

209
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 How many times have you in your life said, "God, what is up with you? Why can't I?"

210
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And he's just like, "Hey, listen, I want to bless you.

211
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Do this. Fill your earth with these things.

212
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Walk with me and act like me. You're made in my image.

213
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And so what I filled your heart with and this Edenic setting that you're in with,

214
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 fill your life with and you'll continue to experience the blessing."

215
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 God said, "Look here, I love you. Look at the world. I made it.

216
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 It's beautiful and it's perfect. This is how you go through this world."

217
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Because you need to hear this. God understands right now that this world is not our home.

218
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 We are aliens and strangers in it.

219
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 We live our lives in a way that people go, "Who are you people

220
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 that aren't trying to figure out how to find life on your own?"

221
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 You live as if you have a script and an understanding and an insight

222
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 that most men don't have.

223
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Because even when evil befalls you, you don't freak out

224
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 and get filled with bitterness and vengeance and rage.

225
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 There is forgiveness. There is a perspective in your life

226
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 that I want to know what the source of it is.

227
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And we go, "Well, here's the source of it.

228
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 My king has told me that the world that we're in is not the world he intended.

229
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 The world that we're in is a world wracked with sin.

230
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Sometimes I know that part of the trouble I have is because I've made choices

231
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 to not walk in the ancient paths where the good way is.

232
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And so sometimes the trouble that I'm in is trouble that I brought on myself.

233
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 But often I'm not doing anything except trying to live faithfully

234
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 and there is loneliness because this world is broken.

235
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 There is sickness and disease because this world is broken.

236
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 There is betrayal because this world is broken.

237
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And Jesus tells me to take heart. This world isn't my home.

238
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Have courage. Speak hope into others that are in the world.

239
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And one day it will be all that you long for.

240
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Meanwhile, have peace.

241
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And yoke yourself with others who live according to the ancient path,

242
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 who want to fill their relationships and fill their world with the good way.

243
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I want to bless you. 1 John 5:3.

244
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 This is the commandment of God, that we keep his commandments

245
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 and his commandments are not burdensome.

246
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Listen, don't miss this. I'm going to show you some Scripture a little bit later

247
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 and a legalist will tell you, do these things and God will bless you.

248
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 That's not your Bible. The Bible is, let me bless you, I love you. Do this.

249
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Do you understand that?

250
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 The law that God gives us is basically instructions from a loving father

251
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 and he's just saying, look, this is good for you.

252
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Now listen, none of us do everything a loving father wants us to do.

253
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 That's called sin.

254
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And it leaves us broken hearted and it leaves us, when we choose to go this way,

255
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 when God says that way, we've offended God, we're turning away from him.

256
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And that's where God says, listen, I understand why you do that

257
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 because you come from a down line of rebels, but I'm going to make provision for you.

258
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And when you turn the wrong way and you come to your senses, just acknowledge,

259
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 this isn't the right way. Confess, which means to agree with.

260
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 This isn't the right way. What am I doing? I've left the ancient paths.

261
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I've turned to the left or to the right.

262
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 I have not trusted in the Lord and leaned not on my own understanding.

263
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I have not in all my ways acknowledged him.

264
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And that's why there is now pain.

265
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 That's why there is now regret.

266
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 That's why there is now shame.

267
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 That's why there is now guilt.

268
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Praise be to God who gave himself for me.

269
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Praise be to God for my living hope.

270
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Let me make amends with everybody that I've wronged in my going the wrong way.

271
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Let me celebrate my risen Lord and let me get back on the straight path.

272
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Let me confess my sins to God that I might be forgiven.

273
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And let me confess my sins to others that we might heal our relationship.

274
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 That's the word of God.

275
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And off we go.

276
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I love talking with you about how we live in light of eternity.

277
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 In light of the reality of the horror of life without God.

278
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And in light of the hope that's coming with life with God.

279
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 See, here's the thing. You just need to know this.

280
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 If you're going home, if Jesus is the provision for your sin,

281
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 if you've acknowledged that you have a tendency to leave the ancient past,

282
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 like all of us have and all of us do,

283
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 and you know that that's an offense to a holy God,

284
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 and you say, "God, I know the wages of my leaving you is death,

285
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 "but I praise you that you've shown me that the free gift is eternal life,

286
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 "is full and continual life with Jesus,

287
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 "but not just in a life to come,

288
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 "but right now I can live a life that's different than the rich can live.

289
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 "I can live a life that is extraordinary,

290
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 "almost alien-ish.

291
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 "I'm not a slave to the world's demands.

292
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 "I'm not going to be filled with its despair

293
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 "because I'm going to live with a perspective

294
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 "that's just a little bit unusual

295
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 "because I have more than the usual wisdom.

296
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 "The Scripture says things which eye hasn't seen, ear hasn't heard,

297
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 "things which don't enter into the hearts of common men.

298
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 "All these things God has freely given to those who love him."

299
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And so we are people of great hope and great perception.

300
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 And why we should discipline ourself, that's fine, you know, to have good bodies.

301
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 It just says make sure you stay attentive

302
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 to not just bodily discipline,

303
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 but especially to godliness for it's profitable.

304
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 You're going to start to experience a little bit more now.

305
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Here's the thing.

306
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 If you're going home, this is your hell.

307
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 If you're going home to heaven, if Jesus is your king,

308
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 this is as bad as it's ever going to get.

309
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And if you're a person who rejects the provision and the kindness of God,

310
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 you're living on an earth that is filled with what is called common grace.

311
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 The rain falls on the wicked and the unjust,

312
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 just like it does on the righteous and the godly.

313
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 It waters your ground.

314
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 When you're a sinner and you nick yourself and you start to bleed,

315
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 God has in your body the ability for that blood to thicken,

316
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 to coagulate, and to stop the bleeding.

317
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 There is music on earth for the sinner and the righteous alike.

318
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 There is the ability to experience temporary pleasure

319
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 through human relationship for the sinner and the righteous alike.

320
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 If you are a rebel against God, this is your heaven.

321
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And it's never going to get better than this.

322
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And so I don't want to say drink deeply,

323
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 but what Solomon would say is, "Hey, yeah, eat, drink, and be merry,

324
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 for tomorrow you die."

325
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 To the believer, he would say, "Hey, listen, man, this world isn't your home.

326
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 To live is Christ, to die is to gain.

327
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 So eat, drink, and be merry, and all that you do, do it for the glory of God,

328
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 for tomorrow you die and you're going home."

329
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 One leaving hell behind forever,

330
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 the other losing even a whisper of what heaven might be like.

331
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 So what do we do in light of this?

332
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 The answer is, is we start to enjoy what God wants us to enjoy right now,

333
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 because what God has done is he's made provision for us right now

334
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 on how to experience more than usual,

335
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 extraordinary, supernatural life now.

336
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 That's who we are if you're a believer.

337
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 There is a condition upon you when you walk in the ancient past

338
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 where the good way is when you walk in it,

339
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 because God blesses you and you no longer think the commandments of God

340
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 are burdensome or rules that you've got to perform

341
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 or things you have to do so he doesn't backhand you,

342
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 but you realize it's the words of a loving father

343
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 and just trying to encourage you and help you.

344
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And he knows you're not going to be perfect, child,

345
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 so I make provision for you.

346
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 The righteous falls seven times and gets back up again,

347
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 with God there to encourage you and to bring you back to completion,

348
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 what he's begun.

349
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And the more you see the goodness of his way,

350
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 the more you walk according to it,

351
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 the more you escape the horror of self-pain.

352
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 You still live in a world that's broken,

353
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 but even then you can sing because you understand why.

354
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Watch this, Ecclesiastes 7.

355
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 It just says this, "A good name is better than good ointment,"

356
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 is what my Bible says your Bible might say is better than perfume.

357
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Okay? Which is kind of funny.

358
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I mean, if I could have perfume or a good name, I mean, give me the good name.

359
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 But the idea here of what perfume represents or oil or good ointment,

360
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 it represents the sense of joy, it represents prosperity.

361
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 But here's the thing, a good name is enduring.

362
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 When you put perfume on, it's not long before just the joy

363
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 and the fleetingness of the moment leaves you,

364
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 and you're left with a rank life.

365
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 No matter how sweet you can make yourself smell for a moment,

366
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 you're not really experiencing the richness and the sweetness of life

367
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 that God intends for you.

368
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And so what he's just saying is don't look for temporary things to please you.

369
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And that's why he says in this next little line,

370
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 "The day of one's death is better than the day of one's birth."

371
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 You have to follow Hebrew poetry here.

372
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 What he's saying in verse 1a, if you want to call it that,

373
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 in Ecclesiastes 7, he's just saying, "Listen, if you live a good life,

374
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 and when you die, that's better than the day of one's birth."

375
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Why? Because the day of one's birth is joyful,

376
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 and there's nothing but the potential for prosperity ahead,

377
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 but there's also drama,

378
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 and there's also the potential to give yourself the fleeting things.

379
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And what Solomon is going to say is you might have moments with just real sweetness,

380
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 but in the end, you're going to have a rank life

381
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 if you don't be attentive to the ways of God.

382
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And so Solomon is saying, "Man, it's better that you've lived a long life

383
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 and been faithful than just starting where you may screw up."

384
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 That's kind of his perspective,

385
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 because what he's going to do the rest of chapter 7

386
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 is he's going to kind of walk through, and he's going to tell you,

387
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 "Hey, there's some people that when they prosper, it screws them up,

388
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 and there's some people when they go through suffering, it screws them up

389
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 because they don't understand how to handle prosperity,

390
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 or they don't have any category to explain corruption."

391
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 So what Solomon's going to do to help you is in verse 2, he says this.

392
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 He says, "Listen, it's better to go to a house of mourning

393
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 than it is to go to a house of feasting."

394
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 You ought to hang out at funerals more than parties,

395
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 because when you're at a funeral, you see what ultimately matters.

396
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 As we were singing here, I don't know if your phones dinged,

397
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 if you follow different news channels, but Barbara Bush died.

398
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Former first lady, the president of the United States.

399
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 It was interesting because I'd seen, we knew that Barbara Bush was sick,

400
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 and all people are going to end up where Barbara Bush does

401
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 in terms of passing through this earth where our earthly bodies

402
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 that are condemned to death until God resurrects our bodies,

403
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 some to judgment and some to life.

404
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Barbara Bush, there was a famous commencement speech she gave

405
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 at an all-girls school, and one of the things she said at the end of the day,

406
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 "You're not going to, at the end of your life, want to have won one more case,

407
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 gotten one more nice outfit, won one more argument.

408
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 You won't regret one test that you didn't do as well in as you wish you would have.

409
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 What you're going to regret are the times you didn't love and care for people,

410
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 the times you didn't prepare yourself to invest in the only things that matter,

411
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 and everything you gave away to fleeting things are not going to be sweet to you

412
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 on the deathbed."

413
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 One time, there was a guy that walked in, and I have sat in chairs

414
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 next to beds of billionaires feeding them ice chips,

415
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 where I have seen their wealth be useless to them.

416
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 I've been in the homes of people who were in palliative care,

417
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 and their homes, these homes that I will never live in,

418
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 of people who are doing exceedingly well,

419
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 and the one man whose home I was in was surrounded by immense wealth this one time,

420
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 and in a sense, he didn't say this, but another time in a story like this,

421
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 you might say, "What is all this that is around you?"

422
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And the answer is, "These are the things that make a deathbed terrible."

423
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Because you feel like you're letting go of everything you've ever invested in.

424
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Instead of following the counsel of God, who wants you to go,

425
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 "Hey, while you're alive, use the things that I've given you to bless others."

426
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Not to just continue to mount up comfort for yourself.

427
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 You're not here to make a living. You're here to make a difference.

428
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 "It is more blessed," Jesus says, the Bible says, "to give than receive."

429
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 He doesn't tell you, "If you don't give more than you receive, you're going to hell."

430
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 He says, "You want to experience a little bit of heaven on earth?

431
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Then be like me."

432
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 "For though I was rich, I became poor, that through my poverty you might become rich."

433
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Who do we get in this room and sing songs about?

434
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Who's seated at the right hand of God? Who's been given a name above all names?

435
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 The answer is Jesus.

436
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I think about William Borden.

437
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 You may never have heard of William Borden before.

438
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 His name is Borden of Yale.

439
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 You know Borden, this is a picture of him, because you drink his family's wealth.

440
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Elsie the cow comes from the Borden family.

441
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 This is the Borden dairy dynasty.

442
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 At the turn of the 19th century, moving into the 20th century,

443
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 young William Borden graduated from high school.

444
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 As part of his graduation gift, his wealthy family gave him a chance to travel around the world.

445
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Bill Borden was a man that went around the world.

446
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 When he went around the world, though, he went with a man of faith.

447
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 That man of faith didn't just take him skiing in the Swiss Alps.

448
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 He took him to certain places where there were people groups that did not know about the ancient past.

449
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 There were people that had been part of human history that had rejected God and his ways

450
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 and had given themselves over to superstition and myth.

451
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Entire generations and cultures were living in the midst of paganism.

452
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Bill Borden saw this.

453
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 He was a man who had a faith.

454
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 While he was over there, God sparked in his life a desire for the nations to understand what he understood.

455
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Not to have the wealth that he did, but to have the wealth of understanding that the grace of God had given him.

456
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 So Bill Borden went back home.

457
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 He went and got his education at the time at Yale University.

458
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 While he was there, his freshman year, when he showed up,

459
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 the president of the university spoke up and gave a speech to all the incoming students.

460
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 He told them, "You all must have a fixed purpose in life."

461
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Borden walked out of that room incredibly agitated.

462
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 His friends that he was just making said, "Why are you so frustrated?"

463
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 He wrote down, "This president neglected to say what our purpose should be."

464
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Can I have my stick back?

465
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 He just said, "You've got to have a great purpose. You've gone on a journey in this life.

466
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 You're not at the end. You're at the beginning. This is the beginning."

467
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 He said, "You must have a purpose."

468
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 But he says, "He neglected to tell us where we should find our purpose

469
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 and where we should get an ability to persevere in our purpose,

470
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 where we get the strength to resist the temptations

471
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 that will have us only seeking after fleeting joys while we're here.

472
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 This man failed us."

473
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And so what he started to do is he said, "I'm going to show you guys where purpose comes from."

474
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 He said, "Wait until you go on the mission field to go reach these unreached people."

475
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 He went to his fellow students at Yale, and he turned to one friend and he said,

476
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 "I'd love you to get up with me in the morning and pray that God will allow us to resist temptation,

477
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 that God will allow us to live according to the purposes that he's given us as men on earth

478
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 that are moving through. This world is not our home."

479
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And every morning, he said, Bill and this one guy would get up, he would read his Bible,

480
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 and he would tell his friend what the Bible meant

481
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 and how God had given them a purpose there that was greater than making fortunes

482
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 or living underneath the fortunes that others have made.

483
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 And then two people joined, and then three people joined, and then four people joined.

484
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 One guy just said this, "When we met Bill,

485
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 it became obvious to us that there was something about him

486
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 that strengthened the rest of us."

487
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 And what it was, it was a man with a conviction. It was a man that understood things

488
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 which Yale students didn't understand, Yale presidents didn't understand.

489
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 The philosophies and elementary instructions of the world weren't giving them that purpose.

490
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 And Bill looked around, he saw the immorality and the hopelessness and the despair of men that were living.

491
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 By the time he graduated four years later, it wasn't one or two men that were with him.

492
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 1,000 of the 1,300 Yale students were in Bible studies

493
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 that Bill had coordinated and led at Yale University.

494
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Did you hear that?

495
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 1,300 students at Yale University at the time, and Bill gave them a purpose.

496
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 And there was a revival that broke out on the Yale campus.

497
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 After he broke out from the Yale campus, he went on to Princeton

498
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 to get further theological training.

499
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And while he was there, he became convinced that God wanted him to reach

500
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 about 10 million Muslims that lived in China.

501
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And so he told his family that he was going to go and give his life

502
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 to reaching these people who did not know Christ and were in bondage to Islam,

503
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 living inside of China.

504
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 His dad said, "If you leave, you'll never have any part in the family business."

505
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And so he took his Bible and he wrote up front, he said, "No reserves.

506
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 My father has told me there will be no fortune if I don't go back and live in the family

507
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 because my dad was okay with me having a faith.

508
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 He just didn't want my faith to inform everything that I did.

509
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Don't be too radical.

510
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Don't be too serious about heaven and hell and the ancient past."

511
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 "No reserves," he wrote in his Bible.

512
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And then he got over there, and as he got on the ship,

513
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 he actually was going to sail first to Cairo because it was in Cairo

514
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 that he was going to learn Arabic so he could speak to the Muslims inside China.

515
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 And as he got on that boat, he wrote down, "No retreats."

516
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 There's no turning back.

517
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 He arrived there in basically January of 1919,

518
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 and he was there learning Arabic, and three months later,

519
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 he contracted spinal meningitis, and 19 days after that, he died.

520
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 And right before he died, he wrote in his Bible, "No regrets."

521
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 You see, the Bible says that God should--we pray in Psalm 90, verse 12,

522
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 that we should pray that God will teach us to number our days

523
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 that we might present to him a life of wisdom.

524
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 One of the things that is just certainly true of most Yalies, most Porches,

525
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 is that we go, "Well, I'm not really sure when I'm going to die,

526
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 but it certainly isn't soon.

527
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 So I'll just do my thing for a while, and I'll be successful,

528
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 and then I'll move to significance."

529
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 And Borden of Yale said, "No, I am going to live right now

530
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 in light of what I believe is the most important thing to do."

531
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 And he gave his life to it.

532
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Not just because he went over to Cairo and eventually was making his way to China,

533
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 but while he was at Yale, he distinguished himself and set a generation on fire.

534
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 There was a trust that had been given to him that he heard about before he died,

535
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 and he intended that that entire trust would be given to people

536
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 that would study the Scripture and teach it in all of its fullness

537
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 with all of the solid doctrine that he had learned himself

538
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 as a young theological student in his later training.

539
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 And the legacy of Borden of Yale's life has led to multiple lives

540
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 being transformed for Christ.

541
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 See, he didn't know that he was going to die in his early 20s,

542
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 but he was ready, and he did what he should do on that journey

543
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 to make the most of it.

544
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 No reserves, no retreats, no regrets.

545
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 The Bible says in Proverbs 20, verse 9, "The glory of young men is their strength,

546
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 but the honor of old men is their gray hair."

547
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 In other words, young people never think they're going to get old,

548
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 and they focus on their strength.

549
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 But old men know they're going to get old and know they're going to die.

550
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 And that gray hair, that sign of wisdom, is sweeter than the perfume of youth.

551
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 "Charm is deceitful, beauty is vain.

552
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 But a woman who ages, whose beauty isn't what it was in her 20s,

553
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 who continues to fear the Lord, that's the woman you want to run with."

554
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 And so you find a young man who walks with the wisdom of the ages

555
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 and yoke yourself with him.

556
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 You find a young woman who, she might be charming and beautiful,

557
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 the young man might be strong, but you find one who is wise,

558
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 and you find one who fears the Lord, and you will be blessed.

559
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 See, that's what God wants you to do.

560
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 In light of eternity, begin to enjoy the God that you're trusting your forever to.

561
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 If you can't trust him with your now, what does that suggest

562
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 about whether or not you really trust him with your forever?

563
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 This is what Solomon says at the very end of his book, just very quickly.

564
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 He just says this in Ecclesiastes 12, verses 1-8, he just says this,

565
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 "Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth."

566
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 This is Solomon at the end of his life, when he had spent his youth

567
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 and his strength and his riches in fleeting things,

568
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 and he had lost his good name.

569
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 He's saying, "Oh, don't make the mistake that I did."

570
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 "Remember your Creator while you're young, before the evil days come

571
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 and the years draw near, when you will say, 'I have no delight in them,'

572
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 because as you get old, you can't do the things you used to do,

573
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 and the world changes."

574
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 And so he uses metaphorical language.

575
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Watch this, "Before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened

576
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 and clouds return after the rain, there is such a thing called

577
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 seasonal affective disorder."

578
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Have you ever heard of that?

579
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 I mean, literally, the acronym for it is SAD.

580
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 And it's called SAD, and a lot of folks up in Washington State have it,

581
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 because it's just gloomy and it rains, it's dark and it's cloudy,

582
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 there's never any sun, there's never any break in the weather,

583
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 and literally in fall through winter, they see people,

584
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 there's a spike in depression, a spike in suicide, a spike in despair,

585
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 and they call it SAD, seasonal affective disorder.

586
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 And really what Solomon is doing, long before we had people who put labels

587
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 on such things, he's saying, "That's what the end of life is like.

588
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 There's nothing but clouds and then rain, and the clouds come back again

589
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 after the rain, and it is SAD."

590
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 That's old age.

591
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 In the day when the watchman of the house trembles,

592
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 that's just like the watchman of the house with the arms, right?

593
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 You know, you ever see the guy, get away, right?

594
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 The arms and the hands, you know, they shake, they tremble like Parkinson's.

595
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 And the mighty men, that's the legs, stoop, and the grinding ones,

596
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 that's the teeth, stand idle because they are few.

597
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 Like everybody turns into a Kentuckian late in their life.

598
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Right?

599
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 You guys do know how we know that the toothbrush was invented in Kentucky.

600
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 If it was invented anywhere else, it would have been called a teethbrush.

601
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And so--

602
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 [Laughter]

603
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 I'm kidding, sorry.

604
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Stay with me, stay with me.

605
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 I've got more.

606
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 [Laughter]

607
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 All right.

608
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 But it just basically says this, right?

609
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 It says that--

610
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Where were we? We're somewhere in here.

611
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 We need teeth. Where are the teeth?

612
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 The grinding ones, they're in verse 3.

613
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 It says, "Those who look through the windows grow dim as eyes."

614
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Solomon's describing old age.

615
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 "The doors on the street are shut."

616
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 That's what he's talking about.

617
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 "The sound of the grinding mill is low."

618
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 You're not chewing like you were.

619
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 "And one will arise at the sound of the birds."

620
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 You're up at 4 a.m.

621
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 "And all the daughters of song will sing softly."

622
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Who's singing? That's Adele. I can't hear her.

623
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Turn her up.

624
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Okay? And so then it goes on.

625
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 "Furthermore, men are afraid of a high place."

626
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 When I built my house--this is true--I built a house 15 years ago.

627
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 And I walked in, and they had put this railing that goes up my steps.

628
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 And I go, "You've got to get--get rid of that railing.

629
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 I just don't like--I like the smooth wall."

630
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 And it looks like just a railing that just--it's an old person's railing.

631
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 And the guy goes, "Bro, it's code, all right?

632
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 I've got to have the railing on there.

633
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 If you want to get the screwdriver out, they inspect it,

634
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 and they give you a certificate of occupancy, you can do it."

635
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 And I'm like, "Well, I'm going to do it. Let me just tell you something.

636
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 I could never come downstairs now if that railing was not there."

637
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 I'm not kidding. You guys--and I'm 55 years old,

638
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 and I get there to the top of the steps in the morning.

639
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 I'm like, "Oh, crud." Right?

640
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 That's Ecclesiastes chapter 55.

641
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 I mean, my knees, my ankles, my plantar fasciitis.

642
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 I mean, I'm just--my back.

643
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 And I'm just kind of like, "Dang!" Right?

644
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 And so I don't want to sit on my butt and kind of go--

645
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 [imitates a baby crying] like a little kid.

646
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 I'm like, "Thank God I didn't take that railing down."

647
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 It's kind of like, "Okay." Right?

648
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 I warm up. Later in the day, I can run up and down.

649
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 But early in the morning, when I wake up at the sound of the bird,

650
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 I'm glad the railing is there, let me just tell you.

651
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Because men are afraid of high places.

652
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 The white tree blossoms. That's--an almond tree has--

653
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 as the almond tree blossoms, the almond tree has white flowers.

654
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 It just says, "Your hair gets white."

655
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 The grasshopper drags himself along, you know, no longer bouncing around.

656
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 Being just the caper berry is ineffective.

657
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 [laughter]

658
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 You put capers next to salmon to increase your appetite.

659
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 And make--you know, just kind of offset it.

660
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 It was an accelerant in terms of food.

661
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 It was also believed to be an aphrodisiac.

662
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 It was kind of ancient days, if you will, viagra.

663
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 And it's the--bro, it doesn't matter how many capers you're pounding down,

664
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 it ain't doing it.

665
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 "For man goes to eternal home while mourners go about in the street."

666
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 Remember, and it just basically says life is over.

667
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 In verse 8, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,

668
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 and giving your life to fleeting things," Solomon's saying,

669
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 "is just not good."

670
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 And so he ends the entire book there in verse 13,

671
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 the conclusion when all's been heard is fear God.

672
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 This is what you do in light of what you've come to know

673
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 about who Jesus is, fear God.

674
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 And keep his commandments.

675
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 I mean, FOMO!

676
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 You ought to have a FOMO that you're going to miss out

677
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 on the blessed way.

678
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 And Solomon's saying it's for young people.

679
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 What did most people say?

680
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 "Hey, go have a good time. When you get a little bit later,

681
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 you can get serious about God." Well, here's the lie.

682
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 You're not going to have a good time if you're not serious about God.

683
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 That's Solomon's point.

684
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 He's coming up with his gray hair, his stoop back,

685
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 and he's just saying, "Let me just tell you, I've done it all.

686
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 I've looked everywhere. You know where life is?

687
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 It's where I was when I was young,

688
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 and I began my life with a fear of the Lord.

689
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 And then I left the ancient past where the good way is,

690
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 and I didn't walk in it, and I have not had rest for my souls.

691
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 My life has been vain and vanity, and so let me beg of you.

692
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 This is how to have a successful life.

693
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 You want to have life in deed?

694
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 You want to have life that's more than more other people?

695
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 You think there's life down there in lower Greenville?

696
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 You think there's life in Cowtown down there by the stockyards?

697
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 No, life is with your king.

698
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Borden of Yale knew where life was.

699
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 That doesn't mean you've got to get on a ship and go to Cairo.

700
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 It means while you're at Yale, you're not there in this university

701
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 where there's a world of ideas debating about where life can be found.

702
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 You're not participating because you've already found life in deed.

703
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 You know why you're here and where you're going.

704
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 You know what your purpose is.

705
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Some of you will have your opportunity to be faithful as bankers and lawyers

706
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 and teachers and mothers and fathers,

707
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 as some of you guys will have careers maybe in more full-time ministry,

708
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 but every single one of us has a chance to walk with God

709
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 and keep his commandments.

710
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 This is what you do in light of a God who rescues you

711
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 from a life of despair without him and promises you more of him.

712
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 He's telling you, "This is me. This is my life.

713
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 Heaven is where you're going to go, and it's going to be all me all the time.

714
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 My will will be done in heaven."

715
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 You want a little bit of heaven now? Walk in my will.

716
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 The world that you're in is not heaven.

717
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 This isn't your home, but walk with me.

718
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 Blessed, says God made man and woman, and he blessed them,

719
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 and he commanded them.

720
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 Do you see that?

721
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 We get it backwards.

722
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 We think God commands them, do this, so I'll bless you.

723
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 No, the commandments are a blessing.

724
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 This is the love of God

725
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 that we keep his commandments,

726
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 and his commandments aren't burdensome.

727
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 That's ecclesiastes.

728
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 It's what you do in light of knowing the truth.

729
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 And then you're like Bourdain and Vieira.

730
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 You're like, "I don't know what else I want to do.

731
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 I just want to make sure wherever I am, whether I stay at Yale

732
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 or get on a ship to go to Cairo so I can go to China,

733
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 I want men to know what I know

734
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 because my kind and gracious and good God has told me where life is."

735
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 I love the statement that meant early conversion

736
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 saves not only a soul from eternal judgment,

737
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 but potentially it points an entire life

738
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 towards the blessing right now that God wants for you.

739
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 It's why I love this generation, love talking to you.

740
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 Listen, I mean, God does promise forgiveness to your repentance.

741
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 He doesn't promise tomorrow to your procrastination.

742
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 Okay, there is one deathbed conversion in your Bible

743
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 so that you might find encouragement that if you dilly-dally through this world

744
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 trying to find life in fleeting things like Solomon,

745
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 that maybe that you can say, "Lord, remember me on this day as I get ready to die."

746
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 There's one deathbed conversion so that you might be comforted,

747
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 but there's only one so that you may not presume.

748
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 And what God's trying to do right now,

749
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 and I want you to understand what I love about speaking to you guys at the porch is

750
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 the 20s is when you want to figure out how to go through the journey.

751
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 It's a fool who says, "I don't know where I'm going.

752
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 I don't know where I'm going to find life.

753
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 I'll just pick around like everybody else.

754
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 I'll get around other fools who are going to manipulate and use and sleep with

755
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 and seek pleasure from one another, and we'll see if it works out

756
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 even though I know it doesn't work out

757
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 because I've got already some foolish guys I've yoked up with.

758
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 I'll kick life out of me.

759
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 I'll keep kicking myself and hating myself,

760
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 and I won't listen to a loving God who just says, "Hey, I'm not mad at you.

761
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired?

762
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 This is the beginning of wisdom, and love it while you're young.

763
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with."

764
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

765
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

766
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

767
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

768
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

769
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

770
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

771
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

772
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

773
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

774
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

775
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

776
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

777
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

778
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

779
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

780
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

781
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

782
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

783
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

784
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

785
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

786
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

787
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

788
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

789
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

790
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

791
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

792
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

793
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

794
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

795
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

796
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

797
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

798
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

799
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

800
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

801
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

802
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

803
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

804
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

805
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

806
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

807
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

808
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Don't go through life carrying a stick that you beat yourself with.

809
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 I don't want people to go to hell, and so I'm going to leave you, my children, behind.

810
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 I'm going to fill you with my spirit, which is a sense that I am holy and good.

811
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 And you're going to walk in the ancient paths, and you're going to declare to people

812
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 where when they don't walk in the ancient paths like you did,

813
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 that they can be forgiven through Jesus Christ.

814
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 And you're going to be the world filled with trouble,

815
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 and you're going to pour yourself out like I did,

816
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 and greater things than I did you will do.

817
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 And you're going to be faithful and live for me.

818
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 And so the acts of the kindness of God have not stopped in Acts 28.

819
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 They will continue.

820
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 And I want to tell you, if you'll live your life with the same intensity and perseverance

821
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 that Solomon exhorts you to, that Borden of Yale wants you to,

822
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 when you're like C.T. Studd who said, "Listen, some want to live within the sound of church bells."

823
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 No, I want to run a rescue shop within a yard of hell.

824
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 I want to be a person who is doing everything he can to help people understand him.

825
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 You'll never regret it.

826
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 So go to your law firms. Go to your sales jobs.

827
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 Be godly mothers and fathers. Be great athletes.

828
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 But in everything you do, do it for the glory of God.

829
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 You live your life with a sense that wisdom beyond your years informs you.

830
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 Not trusting in your strength or your charm, but fearing the Lord

831
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 and walking in the ancient paths

832
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 and telling others where the good way is.

833
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 Nicholas Wertheim was that guy.

834
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 He actually changed his name from Nicholas Wertheim to Nicholas Winton when they moved to England.

835
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 He was a German Jew.

836
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 His parents had left.

837
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 And left Germany.

838
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 And when they left Germany, they moved to England.

839
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 His family educated young Nicholas.

840
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 And he actually became a follower of Jesus Christ.

841
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 Which is the most Jewish thing you can do.

842
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 You do know that.

843
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 Jesus is the Jewish Messiah.

844
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 Jesus says, "I am the Messiah."

845
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 And he gave evidence to back it up.

846
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 Are you the Messiah? Go tell him.

847
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 The lame walk. The blind see.

848
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 Captives being set free.

849
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 I'm the Messiah.

850
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 Nikki understood that Jesus was the way, the truth, and the life.

851
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 And he had a chance to go away and was gonna go skiing himself in the Swiss Alps.

852
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 And he decided to take a detour because he saw what was happening back in Germany to people.

853
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 And he went to Czechoslovakia, which was occupied by Germany at the time.

854
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 And he went in there, and the story's kind of long, but he put his life at risk to start to rescue Jewish children.

855
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 And to use whatever money he could find of his own to bring them out.

856
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 He wasn't there to make a living or to make comfort.

857
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 He was there to make a difference.

858
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 He didn't tell anybody but his mother what he was doing.

859
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 There were over 600 kids that he used his fortune and risked his life to get out of Czechoslovakia

860
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 as parents were being captured and began to be sent off to Auschwitz and other concentration camps.

861
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:31,000
 For 50 years, he didn't tell anybody what he was doing.

862
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 And then his wife was in their attic in 1987, and she found a book.

863
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 And she starts flipping through the book, and she sees just names of these young Jewish children,

864
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 and pictures, and passport numbers, and documents, and addresses that were in England.

865
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 And she gave it to a person who was a historian about the Holocaust.

866
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
 And they went and they researched, and they go, "Oh, my goodness.

867
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 "These are Jewish children that were smuggled out of Czechoslovakia

868
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 "during the time of Hitler's final solution.

869
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 "And your husband must have had something to do with it."

870
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 And so they went and they found a bunch of these children.

871
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 And in 1988, without telling Nicholas why, they got him on a show called "That's Life."

872
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
 And this is a guy who had risked his life for others.

873
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 Watch this little clip.

874
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 All the letters. But back here is the list of all the children.

875
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 This is Vera Diermant, now Vera Gissing.

876
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 We did find her name on his list.

877
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 Vera Gissing is with us here tonight. Hello, Vera.

878
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 And I should tell you that you are actually sitting next to Nicholas Winton.

879
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
 Hello.

880
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 And it was just so wonderful, so terribly, terribly touching.

881
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 APPLAUSE

882
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 Can I ask, is there anyone in our audience tonight who owes their life to Nicholas Winton?

883
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 If so, could you stand up, please?

884
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 APPLAUSE
