 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,280
 All right.

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,200
 A little false start there.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,720
 Sorry about that.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,240
 Welcome to the ports, everybody.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,640
 Glad you guys are here tonight.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,960
 Yes, thank you.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,680
 I want to welcome everybody watching online at all the

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,640
 PortsLive locations.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,000
 My name's Adam Tarnow.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,320
 I'm excited to be with you guys today as we continue on

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,600
 in this roaring '20s sermon series.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
 And so I want to start off with a little story.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,800
 A little over a month ago, my wife and I, we celebrated our

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,640
 16th wedding anniversary.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,400
 Thank you very much.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,640
 Yeah.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,400
 [APPLAUSE]

19
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,680
 16 years in a row, we have been married.

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
 Consecutive years.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,040
 It has been awesome.

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,240
 Got a little picture of what we look like on our wedding day.

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,560
 Always get different reactions to that.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,880
 So I think we got a predominantly female crowd

25
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,000
 here today, because you guys awed at that.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,760
 Usually if it's guys, they just laugh.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,400
 I don't know what that pose is that we are in right there.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,760
 We don't hold hands that way.

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,080
 I've never once in 16 years have we gotten in a pose like

30
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,280
 that, but anyway.

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,360
 So a picture can tell 1,000 words, but there is something

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,160
 that you cannot tell from that picture.

33
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,240
 And what you cannot tell from that picture is this.

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 Is at that moment on the day we said I do, my wife and I,

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,320
 Jackie and I, we were in the middle of a financial crisis.

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,000
 At that moment when that picture was taken, our net

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,120
 worth, our combined net worth now as a married

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,840
 couple was this.

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,520
 It was a negative $120,000.

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,160
 And yet we were still smiling, right?

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,280
 Still smiling and still excited to be married.

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,760
 Now, just to be clear, it wasn't a surprise to us that

43
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,080
 that was what our net worth was.

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,560
 We both knew about this.

45
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,640
 Now 13 months earlier when I met her, I would have been

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,600
 surprised if you would have told me that that's what our

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,240
 financial situation was going to be if we

48
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,320
 ended up getting married.

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,000
 And so 13 months prior, I had just moved here to Dallas to

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,960
 go to seminary to study God's word so that I could maybe go

51
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,840
 on staff at a church or be in full-time ministry and had

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,120
 gotten plugged in here at Watermark and started to go to

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,320
 church here and met Jackie.

54
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,440
 And we started going out.

55
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,720
 And I knew a couple of things about her early on in dating.

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 And you just know a few financial things.

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,040
 And you just kind of know what somebody's job is.

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,360
 And so I knew that Jackie's job was this.

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,280
 I knew that she was an attorney.

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,400
 And I don't know what you learned growing up about

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,560
 attorneys, but I watched a lot of television shows and movies

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,640
 and read some novels, watched TV shows like Suits about all

63
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,360
 these high-powered attorneys.

64
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,080
 And I had just developed this expectation in my mind that

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,840
 all attorneys made a tremendous amount of money,

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
 and their financial situation was they

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
 were really well off.

68
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,880
 Well, I'm in seminary, and I don't know what my financial

69
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,080
 future is going to be.

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,680
 And I'm looking at this relationship, and I'm kind of

71
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,080
 putting two and two together as I'm studying God's word.

72
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,080
 And I'm reading things like Psalm 37, 4 that said, "Delight

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,160
 yourself in the Lord, and he gives you the

74
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,920
 desires of your heart."

75
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,800
 And I'm like, Lord, I did not know that I desired a sugar

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,040
 mama right now.

77
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,360
 But this makes sense to me.

78
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,960
 I mean, this is what a good God would do.

79
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,800
 You uproot your life, and you go, and you move halfway

80
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,760
 across the country.

81
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,240
 And you start to give your life to you.

82
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,720
 And then you bless me with a beautiful attorney wife.

83
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,120
 I like the way this is going.

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,160
 And so the relationship started--

85
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,360
 I never said any of that to her.

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,580
 This is just stuff that I'm thinking.

87
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,080
 And so the relationship progresses, and we start to

88
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,720
 realize, OK, this is probably going to move towards marriage.

89
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,720
 And so we've realized we need to have this conversation.

90
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,640
 We need to share some of our financial

91
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
 details with one another.

92
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,560
 And so I will never forget that night.

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,880
 We met over at her duplex.

94
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,800
 She was sharing a duplex with a roommate.

95
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 We met at her duplex.

96
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,640
 I remember the green couch we were sitting on.

97
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,680
 I remember where I was sitting.

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
 I remember where she was sitting.

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,560
 And I was like, I am pumped for this conversation.

100
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,880
 And I said, I'll go first.

101
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,400
 I'll go first.

102
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,840
 Here's the thing.

103
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,240
 I got about $20,000 in student loan debt.

104
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,000
 I've got a car with over 100,000 miles,

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,040
 but it's paid for.

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,880
 I've got a couple thousand dollars in the bank.

107
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,040
 I tutor accounting part time, because that was what I did

108
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,000
 before I went to seminary.

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,240
 I tutor accounting a part time.

110
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,200
 That's my part time job.

111
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,480
 I get paid hourly for that.

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,880
 And I think I might be a pastor, so I have no clue what

113
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,240
 my financial prospects are in the future.

114
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,800
 Your turn.

115
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,080
 And she said, OK, well, the car I drive right now is a lease.

116
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,040
 And I was like, OK, maybe the firm pays for that.

117
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,680
 Or the organization.

118
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,520
 So it's a lease.

119
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,640
 She said, I have a couple thousand dollars

120
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,720
 in credit card debt.

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
 I got no money in the bank.

122
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,720
 No real savings.

123
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,480
 And this is my income number.

124
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,800
 She told me her income.

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
 And I was like, record scratch.

126
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,320
 And I was like, hold on.

127
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,520
 That's your bonus, right?

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,040
 Like, that's not the income number, right?

129
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,320
 That number's a little bit lower than maybe I was expecting.

130
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,280
 And she said, well, yeah.

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
 I mean, I work for a nonprofit.

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
 And that's what we get paid.

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,520
 And I was like, oh, OK.

134
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,600
 So that's right.

135
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,840
 Television shows are fiction, OK?

136
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,520
 That's not necessarily reality.

137
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,480
 And then she took a deep breath.

138
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,680
 And she goes, but that's not what I'm most embarrassed by.

139
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,760
 She goes, here's the deal.

140
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,200
 I financed my undergrad.

141
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,080
 I financed law school.

142
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:14,080
 And right now, I'm sitting on student loans totaling $100,000.

143
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,040
 So we're sitting there.

144
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,200
 And I was really excited about this conversation.

145
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,280
 And I'm like, all right, I thought

146
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,320
 you were going to be sugar mama.

147
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,960
 And she maybe thought I was going to be sugar daddy.

148
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,720
 And we're like, there's no sugar in this relationship at all.

149
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
 And so you know what we did?

150
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
 We got engaged.

151
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,880
 That's what we did, because we were in love.

152
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,960
 We'll deal with that later, OK?

153
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,040
 I don't know if you should be clapping at that, OK?

154
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,680
 But that's what we did.

155
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,360
 And so our friends and our family

156
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,560
 knew about this situation.

157
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,560
 And they said, hey, here's what we think you should do.

158
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,240
 The church that you're a part of-- so we're at Watermark.

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,320
 The church has this thing called Moneywise, which

160
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,760
 is just this ministry that teaches God's word.

161
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,240
 And God's perspective on how to deal with your finances.

162
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,720
 Maybe you should call up a leader at Moneywise

163
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
 and meet with them before you get married,

164
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,400
 just to get their advice on what to do.

165
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,360
 And we said, great, we'll do that.

166
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,440
 So we sent an email and got a meeting set up with somebody.

167
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,640
 And they sent us a worksheet.

168
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,360
 And I'll never forget filling out that worksheet.

169
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,880
 They said, before our meeting, I want

170
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,800
 you to fill out this worksheet.

171
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,300
 And at the top of the worksheet, it

172
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,880
 said, list all your assets here.

173
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,560
 And so we listed like two or three things.

174
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
 And it said, now list all your liabilities.

175
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
 And we listed a lot of things.

176
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,200
 And it said, take your assets, subtract your liabilities.

177
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,680
 And this is what your net worth is.

178
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,240
 And I remember I had to fill it out as a negative number,

179
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,160
 negative $120,000.

180
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,280
 I remember meeting with this person.

181
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
 And so it was a gentleman who was serving at Moneywise,

182
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,600
 who was one of the elders here at Watermark, a guy

183
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,760
 by the name of Kyle Thompson.

184
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,800
 And he met us before one Sunday--

185
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,920
 or one Sunday before church, he met us for coffee.

186
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,120
 And I remember that shame and that embarrassment

187
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,740
 as I slid that sheet of paper across the table to him

188
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,040
 and said, this is our situation.

189
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,840
 What do you think?

190
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,160
 And he was so kind to us.

191
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,960
 And he sat there.

192
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,000
 And he helped us brainstorm some things.

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,360
 And he basically had one idea.

194
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,200
 He said, listen, I'm not going to tell you

195
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,440
 that you shouldn't get married with this amount of debt.

196
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,160
 But I am telling you right now, you guys

197
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,920
 need to come up with a plan.

198
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,680
 You need to come up with a plan.

199
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,040
 Because this debt is not going to be easy to get out of.

200
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,480
 And it's not going to take care of itself.

201
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,360
 And so you've got to have a plan, in a way,

202
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,160
 to get out of that.

203
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,940
 And we said, great.

204
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,860
 And so we thanked him.

205
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,880
 And we got in the car.

206
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,040
 And we came up with a plan.

207
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,320
 And the plan was to ignore it.

208
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,480
 And we followed that plan perfectly.

209
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,800
 And so we got married.

210
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,280
 And for six months, the first six months of our marriage,

211
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,920
 we just completely ignored this.

212
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,100
 It was like this sleeping giant that

213
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,360
 was in the corner of our small apartment.

214
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,240
 And we just wanted him to stay asleep.

215
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,960
 Just don't talk about debt.

216
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,880
 And let's just make sure that he stays asleep.

217
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,160
 And so six months, we sat there.

218
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,880
 And we ignored it.

219
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,760
 And then June 20, 2004, we show up to church that morning.

220
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,480
 And a gentleman gets on stage to preach.

221
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480
 And it's that same guy we met with six months earlier.

222
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,160
 Kyle Thompson gets back up on stage.

223
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,600
 And he is preaching a message called

224
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,200
 Debt, a Biblical Perspective.

225
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,400
 And 27 minutes into that message,

226
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,440
 he opened up and turned to God's word.

227
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,000
 And he went to Proverbs 22.7.

228
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,680
 And this is what he read.

229
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,280
 He read this.

230
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,720
 He said, "The rich rule over the poor.

231
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,120
 And the borrower is slave to the lender."

232
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,760
 And he went on.

233
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,600
 And he talked about how when you're in debt,

234
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,280
 you feel like you were in this prison.

235
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,520
 And my wife and I, we were sitting

236
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,840
 on this side of the auditorium.

237
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,760
 And 27 minutes into that message, that scripture,

238
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,920
 it just pierced our hearts.

239
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,760
 And we just said, we have got to do something about this.

240
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,560
 That is exactly what we're feeling right now.

241
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,320
 We feel stuck.

242
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,600
 And so the church service ended.

243
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,680
 And we got back in our car.

244
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,920
 And we drove back to our apartment.

245
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,480
 And we had, what I can tell you now,

246
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,360
 16 years later, the most significant,

247
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,840
 or one of the most significant conversations we'd ever had,

248
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,000
 and still to this day, have ever had in our marriage.

249
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,640
 And we decided we were going to do something about our debt.

250
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,960
 And I start with all of that.

251
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,520
 Because at the time when we heard that message,

252
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
 and when Jackie and I first got married,

253
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,440
 we were 28 and 29 years old.

254
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,280
 We were ending this decade of our 20s.

255
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,360
 We were ending this roaring 20s.

256
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,480
 And the way our 20s were ending was very different

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,520
 than the way it began.

258
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,400
 It was ending, and the predominant emotion

259
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,200
 that we felt was fear, uncertainty, shame, hopelessness.

260
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,000
 And that is not the way our 20s started.

261
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,240
 Our 20s started with a tremendous amount of hope.

262
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,160
 The future seemed to be pregnant with possibility.

263
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,640
 It was just anything could possibly happen.

264
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,360
 And the difference between when we entered into our 20s

265
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
 and when we were leaving our 20s,

266
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,960
 why it went from hope to just shame,

267
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,360
 and fear, and uncertainty,

268
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,720
 was because all throughout our 20s,

269
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,720
 we made some really poor financial decisions.

270
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,040
 We made some poor choices.

271
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
 And as we continue on in this series,

272
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,640
 the roaring 20s, it really makes sense

273
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,560
 that this is something that we have to talk about,

274
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,960
 especially given this decade of decisions

275
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,000
 that so many of you guys are living in right now,

276
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 here in your 20s.

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,520
 And I think this is a really, really important message

278
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,960
 for all of us, because here's what we all know is true,

279
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,240
 is that money impacts every single person

280
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
 in this room tonight.

281
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,040
 All of us are impacted by money.

282
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,800
 And it does not matter where you are

283
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,960
 on the financial spectrum.

284
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,800
 If you're in here and your net worth is a negative,

285
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
 and it's like six or seven digits,

286
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,040
 or your net worth is positive,

287
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,280
 and it's positive six or seven digits,

288
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,000
 it doesn't matter where you are on that spectrum,

289
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,800
 money impacts your life.

290
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,320
 And if you don't have the right perspective,

291
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,360
 and if you don't have a healthy relationship

292
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,080
 with money and possessions,

293
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,400
 you don't have that healthy relationship,

294
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,840
 then money is going to just rob you of life.

295
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,040
 And so we've got to take a look at this.

296
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,920
 And so tonight, what I want to do is I just want to talk

297
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,920
 about three really simple decisions

298
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,440
 that every single one of us need to make

299
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,560
 when it comes to money.

300
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,040
 We're going to open up God's word and look at how God's word

301
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,560
 informs the way we think about money.

302
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,840
 And some of you may even sit there

303
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,480
 and are just scratching your head a little bit at that,

304
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,720
 of just going, hold on, the Bible talks about money.

305
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,680
 And I just want to let you know, yeah,

306
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,880
 the Bible has a lot to say about money.

307
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
 In fact, it says some very counter-cultural things

308
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,040
 about money.

309
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,080
 And here's just two of them real quick,

310
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,360
 'cause this is going to help frame up the rest

311
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,480
 of our conversation for this evening.

312
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,100
 The first counter-cultural thing that scripture says

313
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,960
 about money is this, is that money is primarily

314
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,400
 a heart issue, not a numbers issue.

315
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,440
 Jesus in Matthew chapter six, verse 21,

316
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,400
 he says that where your heart is,

317
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,440
 that's where your treasure will be.

318
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,680
 And so Jesus makes it really clear that your heart,

319
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,880
 your heart is really what determines your relationship

320
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,680
 and the kind of relationship that you have

321
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,700
 with money and possessions.

322
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,480
 It's not just, the numbers don't tell the whole story.

323
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,240
 What tells the whole story is where is your heart

324
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,840
 in this relationship with money and possessions?

325
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,560
 So that's the first counter-cultural thing

326
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,000
 that scripture says about money.

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,360
 And the second one is this, is that our relationship

328
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,760
 with money and possessions is to be a relationship

329
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,440
 that's primarily defined by stewardship,

330
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,960
 not defined by ownership.

331
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,440
 Let me unpack that a little bit,

332
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,160
 'cause stewardship and steward, that's a word

333
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,060
 that many of us don't use very often.

334
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,040
 And so when I say steward, here's what I mean.

335
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,520
 A steward is this, a steward is somebody

336
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,200
 who manages another's property

337
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,060
 according to the owner's vision and values.

338
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,980
 So a steward is somebody who has been given

339
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,600
 somebody else's property, and that steward is responsible

340
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,940
 for managing that property, not according to their own

341
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,040
 vision and values and according to what they wanna do,

342
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,640
 but according to the owner's vision and values.

343
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,720
 And that is the relationship that you and I are to have

344
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,600
 with money and possessions according to God's word.

345
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,760
 And you see that in 1 Chronicles 29, 10,

346
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,240
 all the way through 20, you see it in Psalm 24, 1,

347
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,840
 it talks about the earth is the Lord's

348
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,760
 and everything in it, which means this.

349
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,880
 It means that we are stewards of everything

350
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,460
 and owners of nothing.

351
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,040
 And so our relationship with money and possessions

352
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,660
 is driven primarily by our heart

353
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,880
 and our relationship with God,

354
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,000
 and the relationship that God wants us to have

355
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,240
 with money and possessions is the one of stewardship,

356
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,640
 not one of ownership.

357
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,320
 And so if we want to be faithful stewards,

358
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,920
 then there's some decisions that we're gonna need to make,

359
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,800
 especially in this decade of decisions

360
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,520
 that you guys are navigating right now.

361
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,880
 And these decisions that we're gonna make

362
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,340
 are gonna keep our relationship with money

363
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,520
 and possessions healthy,

364
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,040
 ultimately keep our relationship with God healthy,

365
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
 and help you and I to be faithful stewards.

366
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,200
 So if you got your Bibles, here we go,

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,180
 let's jump in first to Proverbs 27,

368
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,200
 verses 23 through 27,

369
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,800
 here's what the author of Proverbs 27 says, is this.

370
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,480
 It says, "To be sure to know the condition of your flocks

371
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,220
 "and give careful attention to your herds.

372
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,240
 "For riches do not endure forever,

373
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,880
 "and a crown is not secure for all generations."

374
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,040
 Again, some of you may be sitting there going,

375
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,400
 Adam, I don't know where you live right now,

376
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 but I just want to inform you, I do not live on a farm.

377
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,960
 Okay, so I'm having trouble connecting the dots here,

378
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
 'cause I think he's talking about like farm stuff,

379
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,480
 know the condition of your flocks,

380
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,240
 give careful attention to your herds,

381
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,220
 like what's up here, what am I supposed to learn from this?

382
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,380
 And let me explain.

383
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,400
 The author of this proverb was writing to an audience

384
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,560
 that was primarily living,

385
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,940
 or they were living in an agrarian culture,

386
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,260
 meaning everybody kind of lived on a farm at that point.

387
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,260
 Everybody was, that was the way

388
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,580
 that they were taking care of themselves

389
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,900
 and taking care of their families.

390
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,860
 And so what the author of this proverb

391
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,300
 is reminding the readers is this,

392
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,900
 is hey, give careful attention to your flocks

393
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,140
 and to your herds, know the condition of those.

394
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,620
 What he's basically saying here is be diligent.

395
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,260
 Be diligent with your sources of income.

396
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,620
 Track your sources of income.

397
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,260
 Make sure you have a good understanding

398
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,420
 of your sources of income.

399
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,340
 And the reason why is because those riches

400
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,220
 don't endure forever,

401
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,480
 and a crown is not secure for all generations.

402
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,860
 Just because you have some money

403
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,320
 or some sources of income today

404
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,940
 doesn't mean you're gonna have it tomorrow.

405
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,400
 And so the first decision that we need to make,

406
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,900
 especially in this decade,

407
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,420
 the first decision that you need to make is this,

408
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,040
 is you need to decide to be diligent.

409
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,280
 Decide to be diligent.

410
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,840
 And you need to decide to be diligent

411
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,040
 for the exact same reasons

412
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,940
 that the author of this proverb

413
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,500
 was encouraging the readers to be diligent.

414
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,980
 It's because if you're not diligent,

415
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,980
 things can quickly get out of control.

416
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,220
 You've gotta be able to watch

417
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,300
 and know the conditions of the source of your income

418
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,380
 so that you can take care of yourself

419
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,180
 and take care of maybe your family one day.

420
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,460
 You've gotta be diligent with that.

421
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,300
 So how are we diligent today?

422
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,940
 How are we diligent?

423
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,620
 The primary way that we are diligent today is this,

424
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,100
 and this is not gonna be very popular,

425
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,260
 but this is how you do it.

426
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,960
 You have a budget,

427
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,200
 and you have a system for tracking your expenses.

428
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,520
 That is the best way to be diligent.

429
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,320
 That is the best way to know the condition of your flocks

430
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,680
 and the condition of your herds

431
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,200
 is to know and track those sources of income,

432
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,720
 where those dollars are coming, where are they going,

433
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,880
 and to track that stuff.

434
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,780
 And so you just need to pick a tool.

435
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,680
 Pick one that will work for you.

436
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,280
 You can use the one that my wife and I,

437
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,000
 we love this one called YNAB, you need a budget.

438
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,840
 It like judges you every time you open it,

439
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,720
 it just commands you,

440
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,200
 hey, just let me remind you, you need a budget.

441
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,440
 I preach, you're right, I do, I need one.

442
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,000
 Just reminds you every day.

443
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,960
 It's this great system and it connects to your bank

444
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,600
 and it tracks your expenses and helps you set up a budget.

445
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,300
 There's mint.com, you can use an Excel spreadsheet.

446
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,640
 You can use the register in the checkbook if you want to.

447
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,200
 Just use a system that works for you

448
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,140
 to know well the condition of your flocks.

449
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,320
 And the reason that we are to do this

450
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,940
 is because if we don't, if we don't do this,

451
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,660
 things can get out of control in a hurry.

452
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,240
 And so yes, we may not live in an agrarian culture

453
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,480
 right now where we're on farms and we gotta know,

454
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,160
 you know, that pig last year got me this much money

455
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,720
 and that one this year got me that,

456
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,380
 you know, last year got me this much.

457
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,860
 You know, it may not be that right now,

458
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,280
 but we do live in a strange time right now

459
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,940
 where it really is a challenge to continue to be diligent.

460
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,840
 And the time that you and I live in right now is this,

461
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,800
 is we live in a cashless culture.

462
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,700
 And spending nowadays is so easy, so easy.

463
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,080
 I don't know about you guys, but I remember back

464
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,320
 to when I first started making money,

465
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,600
 I was mowing grass like 14, 15 years old,

466
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,320
 and I would be done mowing the grass

467
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,960
 and I would go knock on the door of the person

468
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
 whose lawn I just mowed and you know what they did?

469
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,320
 You know how they paid me?

470
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,400
 They gave me this paper.

471
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,440
 It was like cash, they just gave it to me.

472
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,960
 Said, "Here, this is cash for what you just did."

473
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,280
 And I would take that cash and I would put it in my wallet.

474
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,300
 And so all I had to do to keep, you know,

475
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,580
 know the condition of my flocks

476
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,820
 and give careful attention to my hurts

477
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,920
 was not lose my wallet.

478
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,060
 That's all I had to do.

479
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,500
 And when I first started making money

480
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,980
 and there was cash in there,

481
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,300
 every transaction felt like losing.

482
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,480
 I would go to the movies with my friends

483
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,860
 or go to restaurants with my friends

484
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,260
 or I'd go to the baseball card shop or something like that

485
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,300
 and I would take money out and every single time

486
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,740
 I took that cash out and I put it across

487
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,480
 to pay for the movie or pay for the food

488
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,940
 or buy the baseball cards,

489
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,600
 every single time it felt like I was losing something.

490
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,520
 There was an emotion attached to that cash transaction.

491
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,040
 And nowadays, nowadays I'm just trying to keep my wallet

492
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,380
 as thin as possible.

493
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,840
 I don't want cash in there, right?

494
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,800
 I don't wanna lug all that around

495
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,600
 and nowadays we've got credit cards and debit cards

496
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,800
 and Venmo and PayPal and Apple Pay

497
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,760
 and things on your watch and all that kind of stuff.

498
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,740
 We've got all these digital cash transactions.

499
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,640
 And nowadays, the emotion with spending is gone.

500
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,160
 So what spending used to feel like losing,

501
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,540
 now you know what spending feels like,

502
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,480
 especially if you use a credit card.

503
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,760
 Spending feels like earning now.

504
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,980
 You know why?

505
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,000
 Because the banks have played this Jedi mind trick on us

506
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 and they've gotten us to believe

507
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,380
 that points are somehow more valuable than dollars.

508
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,760
 And so we'll go, yeah, okay, that cost 45 bucks.

509
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,640
 Oh, well, that's 45 points

510
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,200
 and points are more valuable than dollars.

511
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,120
 And so we'll walk away from a transaction

512
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,960
 and you don't feel like you lost anything.

513
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
 You feel like you just gained something.

514
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,720
 And it is so easy nowadays,

515
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,160
 so easy to not only spend the money you have,

516
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,140
 but also to spend the money you don't have.

517
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,960
 Things can quickly get out of control,

518
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,780
 which is why every month when you get that email

519
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,080
 from your bank that says,

520
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,560
 "Here's your credit card statement for the month,"

521
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,540
 you like brace because you've been ignoring

522
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,280
 all of those transactions,

523
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,760
 just trying to fit in and have fun

524
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,040
 and just swipe, swipe, swipe,

525
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,160
 just going, "I'll deal with that later."

526
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,320
 And then the day of reckoning has come

527
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,440
 in the middle of the month

528
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,040
 and you've got to open up that statement

529
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,780
 and you feel what so many people feel

530
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,520
 where you just go, "Phew, it did not feel

531
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,160
 "like I was spending that much."

532
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,900
 Like, "Well, but I got a bunch of points, so that's okay.

533
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,500
 "Get a free flight to go somewhere

534
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
 "and spend a bunch of other money that I don't have.

535
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,800
 "We'll just keep this cycle going

536
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,160
 "over and over and over again."

537
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,400
 And so we gotta have a plan,

538
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,820
 we gotta be diligent,

539
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,380
 you've got to decide to be diligent

540
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,740
 because if you don't, things will get out of control

541
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,700
 and then you won't be able to catch up.

542
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,500
 But the other reason we need to be diligent is this,

543
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,060
 is what we've just talked about with stewardship.

544
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,500
 You know why?

545
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,260
 Because it's not your money.

546
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,800
 It's not yours.

547
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,340
 I mean, imagine this,

548
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,660
 imagine I just had $1,000 in my pocket right now

549
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,060
 and I brought one of you up and I just said,

550
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,940
 "Here, here's 1,000 bucks.

551
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,460
 "You do one job and that is just go invest it."

552
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,240
 And you went home and then you woke up tomorrow morning

553
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,360
 and you went into the bank and you walked into the bank

554
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,560
 and you go, "Listen, I was given this $1,000.

555
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,640
 "I just need you to invest it in something."

556
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,960
 And you hand it over to the bank teller

557
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,080
 and say, "Please invest it."

558
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,720
 And then imagine you leave

559
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,880
 and you come back a month later

560
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
 and you're like, "I wanna see how the investment is doing."

561
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,400
 And you go up to the exact same bank teller

562
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,040
 and you go, "Hey, last month I was in here

563
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,600
 "and I gave you $1,000 and I wanted you to invest it.

564
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,420
 "I entrusted my money to you

565
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,520
 "and I wanted you to invest it.

566
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,200
 "I'd like to know how that investment is doing."

567
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,160
 And imagine what you would feel like

568
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,440
 if the bank teller looked at you and was like,

569
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,780
 "Oh yeah, I think I kinda remember you.

570
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,000
 "You get, was it 100 bucks?

571
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,400
 "No, it was 1,000."

572
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,760
 And then they just start looking around

573
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,840
 and lifting up papers and looking for that money

574
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,080
 and getting online and trying to check different things

575
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,840
 and they're like, "I know we didn't spend it

576
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,520
 "but I don't know exactly where it is right now."

577
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,960
 So can we, like what's your phone number?

578
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,000
 Can I call you later and just try to let you know?

579
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 You would not walk out of there feeling very comfortable

580
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,960
 and trusting that bank, right?

581
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,040
 You would not say they're being diligent.

582
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,400
 You would be frustrated and the primary reason

583
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,800
 you would be frustrated by that

584
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,480
 is because it's not their money

585
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,320
 and they were being careless with it.

586
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
 And I would imagine there's some of you

587
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,840
 in the room here tonight and you're sitting there going,

588
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,780
 listen Adam, I get it that I need to have a plan

589
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,080
 and track expenses and have a budget.

590
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,000
 I think I'm doing okay.

591
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,740
 I mean, I log on to my bank app every single day

592
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,360
 and I monitor that balance of my bank account

593
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,080
 and I never bounce a check and I never overdraw.

594
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,720
 I'm always paying off my credit card bill.

595
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,840
 I pay all my bills on time.

596
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,860
 I don't think I need a budget.

597
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,660
 I don't think I need to track anything.

598
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,960
 I think I'm doing okay.

599
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,440
 And I just wanna remind you that okay,

600
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,840
 just doing okay is not okay.

601
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,360
 That's not being diligent.

602
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,000
 If you wanna be a faithful steward,

603
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,280
 if you wanna have a good relationship

604
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,200
 with money and possessions,

605
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,760
 then you will make that decision to be diligent

606
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,400
 because it's not your money.

607
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,720
 And if you're not diligent, the riches don't endure forever.

608
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,520
 Things can get out of control in a hurry.

609
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,960
 So that's the first decision.

610
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,120
 The second decision is this, is you've got to decide,

611
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,760
 you've gotta decide to deal with debt.

612
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,720
 Decide to deal with debt.

613
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,000
 Now let me just be really clear here

614
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,640
 about a couple of things and specifically

615
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,720
 with the way scripture talks about debt.

616
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,560
 I wanna be clear with this,

617
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,120
 is that God's word does not say that debt is a sin.

618
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,360
 It does not command you that you cannot enter in to debt

619
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,280
 or go into debt.

620
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,120
 What God's word says about debt is this,

621
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,480
 is that it cautions us to be careful with debt,

622
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,520
 but it does not command us to completely avoid debt.

623
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
 The best way I know how to think about this

624
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,880
 from a word picture perspective

625
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,320
 that we all understand is this,

626
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,880
 is that debt is like a port-a-potty, okay?

627
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,400
 So we are cautioned to avoid port-a-potties

628
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,520
 as often as we possibly can, right?

629
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,400
 Like we are to use them as a last resort.

630
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,640
 And then if you do have to use one,

631
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,960
 you wanna get in and get out as fast as you can, right?

632
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,200
 And so it's the same thing with debt.

633
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,120
 We're just cautioned against it.

634
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,640
 And if you have to use debt, use it as a last resort.

635
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,080
 And if you have to enter into debt,

636
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,200
 just try to get in and get out as fast as you possibly can.

637
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,280
 And so if you want, if you wanna be a faithful steward,

638
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,000
 and if you wanna have a healthy relationship

639
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,320
 with money and possessions,

640
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,280
 if you want money not to rob you of life,

641
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,680
 then you have got to make a decision to deal with debt.

642
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,600
 And the reason God wants you and I to be cautious with debt

643
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,960
 is because that verse that Kyle Thompson read

644
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,120
 27 minutes into that message back in June of 2004,

645
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,320
 is that the rich rule over the poor,

646
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,000
 the borrower is the slave to the lender.

647
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,840
 When you and I, when we are in debt, we are not free.

648
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,240
 There are things that we wanna do that we can't do.

649
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,080
 There's things that we want to plan for the future

650
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,440
 that we can't plan for the future.

651
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,560
 It's just this cloud that follows us everywhere.

652
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,880
 And God doesn't want this cloud to follow us everywhere.

653
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,360
 He wants us to be free.

654
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,600
 And so He wants us to decide to deal with our debt now.

655
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,400
 And I just wanna be a friend and just remind you

656
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 of something, that there is no easy way out of debt.

657
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,800
 It's just, and nobody's gonna force you

658
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,000
 to do anything with it.

659
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,280
 Nobody's gonna push you to do anything with it.

660
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,520
 You have got to make the decision

661
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,100
 that I wanna do something with this debt.

662
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,720
 You've gotta do it.

663
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,880
 And there's no easy way out.

664
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,280
 And so I've been on staff here at Watermark

665
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,120
 for almost 10 years.

666
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,240
 And I had a couple of year run where I was leading

667
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,480
 Money Wise, that financial stewardship ministry

668
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,600
 that I was telling you guys about.

669
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,680
 And I had a chance to lead that.

670
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,160
 And I just had countless conversations with people

671
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,440
 who were in debt and just felt stuck.

672
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,120
 Countless conversations with people that are like,

673
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,360
 listen, I wanna get out of debt.

674
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,800
 I'm motivated to get out of debt.

675
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,480
 I'm looking at the budget right now.

676
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,360
 And I don't know where I'm gonna find any extra money

677
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,520
 to be able to get out of debt.

678
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,880
 Will you help me look at this budget

679
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,800
 and help me find some money?

680
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,320
 And I mean, this conversation happened over and over

681
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,160
 and over again.

682
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,640
 I'd sit with somebody and they'd show me their budget.

683
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,280
 And they go, look, here's the income.

684
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,440
 Here's all the expenses.

685
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,120
 I don't know where I'm gonna be able to find any money.

686
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,520
 I feel like I'm barely making ends meet right now.

687
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,720
 How am I gonna find more money to throw at the debt?

688
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,520
 And they would start to pick on the exact same

689
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
 two categories.

690
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,180
 So many people did this.

691
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,320
 They go, I bet I could eat out less.

692
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,660
 And I bet I could cancel Netflix or DirecTV

693
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,520
 or something like that.

694
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,560
 I bet if I did that, that would free up some cash

695
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,000
 so that I could start to throw it at the debt

696
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,840
 and get out of it.

697
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,520
 And I would have the same conversation.

698
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,160
 I'm going, yeah, that might be the right move.

699
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,200
 It might be the right move.

700
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,920
 But what you need right now is you don't need

701
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,240
 dozens of dollars.

702
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,140
 You need hundreds of dollars.

703
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,240
 Dozens of dollars are gonna be helpful

704
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,080
 to get you out of debt.

705
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,720
 But when you're really drowning in debt right now,

706
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,960
 you don't need dozens of dollars.

707
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
 You need hundreds of dollars a month

708
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,060
 that you can throw at that debt

709
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,240
 so you can feel like you're starting to make progress.

710
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,880
 And if that's you here tonight,

711
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,080
 if you're sitting there and you're like, listen,

712
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,080
 I feel that, I feel stuck, I don't know where to start,

713
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,440
 I'd love to try to find hundreds of dollars if I could

714
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,600
 in my budget right now,

715
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,760
 here are the three categories you've got to look at.

716
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,840
 It's not just food and entertainment.

717
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,160
 That'll get you maybe a little bit of the way there.

718
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,360
 But the three categories are this.

719
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,500
 You've gotta look at housing, transportation, and income.

720
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,700
 Housing, transportation, and income.

721
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,220
 That's usually where you can find hundreds of dollars.

722
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,720
 And so let's just unpack that a little bit

723
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,360
 because here's what this means from a housing perspective.

724
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,920
 What this means from a housing perspective

725
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,480
 is that some of you might need to make

726
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,960
 a really difficult decision

727
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,840
 about your current housing situation

728
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,320
 to free up some cash so that you can deal with that debt.

729
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,560
 And what this means is that some of you in here tonight

730
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,520
 might need to call your parents on the way home

731
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,400
 and go, listen, can I move back in?

732
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,520
 Can I move back in right now

733
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,560
 because I'm paying so much money

734
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,180
 to live in this apartment right now

735
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,520
 in this cool part of town where all the cool people are,

736
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,680
 and I think if I could free that money up,

737
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,800
 I could be out of debt in like a couple of years.

738
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,680
 Can I move back in right now?

739
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,160
 Or if you don't wanna call your parents

740
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,100
 or your parents live out of town and you don't wanna move,

741
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,120
 then you need to start to call some friends

742
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,040
 and go, listen, let's just be roommates.

743
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,600
 Let's squeeze as many people in here as we can

744
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,240
 and let's just try to reduce as many costs as possible

745
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,480
 so that we can all deal with this debt.

746
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,380
 And I know what you're thinking.

747
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,480
 You're sitting there going, yeah, Adam, like roommates.

748
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,320
 That was college.

749
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,180
 I'm not doing that right now, okay?

750
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,880
 You think I'm gonna be having roommates

751
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,200
 and deal with all the, they always leave their dishes

752
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,280
 and they're loud and sharing a bathroom

753
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,080
 and sharing a bedroom and all that kind of stuff.

754
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,640
 You think I'm gonna do that anymore?

755
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,800
 I am done with that.

756
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,160
 Is that what you're telling me to do, Adam?

757
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,600
 Yeah, that's what I'm telling you to do.

758
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,160
 That's what I'm encouraging you to do.

759
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,680
 And here's the thing.

760
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,760
 This whole thing with roommates, if you do that,

761
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,180
 there's gonna be a little benefit in there.

762
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,400
 One of the benefits is this,

763
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,160
 that if you deal with roommates,

764
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,680
 it'll make you a better spouse one day.

765
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,260
 So if that's in your plans, if that's in your desires,

766
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,780
 that you wanna get married, guess what?

767
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,980
 That'll make you a little bit better

768
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,860
 because here I don't mean to burst anybody's bubble.

769
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,020
 Marriage is primarily a roommate situation, okay?

770
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,600
 There's a lot of just chores and making sure

771
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,140
 that everybody's living together fine.

772
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,180
 And so having a roommate is a great way

773
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,000
 to get ready for that.

774
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,260
 And so look at your housing situation.

775
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,660
 Look at that and think about, all right,

776
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,220
 what can I do if I could cut my rent in half?

777
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,060
 What can I do there?

778
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,100
 So that's housing, transportation.

779
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,480
 I know some of you, this may be the first time

780
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,880
 you've heard this, it is not just normal

781
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,760
 to always have a car payment.

782
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,680
 That's not normal.

783
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,220
 It's not just what everybody else does all the time.

784
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,560
 And so for some of you, what you might need to do

785
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,720
 is sit there and go, listen, I'm always in a new car.

786
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,060
 I don't need to be in a new car all the time.

787
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,800
 I've got just some news for you.

788
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,980
 I don't know if you guys know this,

789
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,800
 but cars, they still work after 10 years, often.

790
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,140
 They drive fine.

791
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,600
 And I don't know if you guys know this too,

792
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,860
 but auto manufacturers, they make all kinds of cars.

793
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,420
 They make more than just trucks and SUVs.

794
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,640
 They make smaller cars that are cheaper.

795
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,480
 It's just crazy.

796
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,560
 It's like this feat of engineering.

797
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,540
 They're cheaper.

798
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,280
 They're cheaper to buy and they're cheaper to drive.

799
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,840
 And so for some of you, what you may need to do

800
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,880
 is just sit there and go, listen,

801
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,280
 I don't need to always have this new car,

802
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,440
 this 500, $600 a month car payment.

803
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,400
 I'm gonna sell that car back

804
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,180
 and I'm gonna take whatever I've got in my savings

805
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,100
 and just go to Craigslist

806
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,180
 and I'm just gonna sort by a thousand bucks

807
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,960
 and I'm just gonna buy whatever's out there

808
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,020
 and just do that.

809
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,180
 Or I'm gonna get into a cheaper car.

810
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,020
 So housing, transportation.

811
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,160
 And then here's another one

812
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,120
 that I just don't think many people look at is income.

813
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,960
 Is income.

814
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,680
 A lot of times, people think they have an expense problem

815
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,240
 when really they don't have an expense problem.

816
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,060
 The expenses are what they are.

817
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,040
 Life is expensive.

818
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,320
 A lot of times what people have is an income problem.

819
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,760
 And so for you, what you may need to do

820
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,960
 if you're gonna deal with debt is this,

821
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,880
 is you need to start thinking about your weekends differently

822
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,200
 thinking about your nights differently.

823
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,760
 The weekends are now not a time for you to go to achieve,

824
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,800
 you know, live in your Michelob Ultra commercial life

825
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,860
 or something like that, right?

826
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,560
 Like maybe what you need to do on the weekends is this,

827
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,200
 instead of going to the restaurants with your friends,

828
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,240
 you just need to work at that restaurant.

829
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,680
 Instead of taking Uber all around all week,

830
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,160
 you need to drive for Uber.

831
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,800
 And just look for those,

832
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,200
 just a couple of hundred dollars extra a month

833
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,600
 to start to think differently about this

834
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,120
 because nobody's gonna do this for you.

835
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,680
 And there's no easy way out of it

836
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,560
 and you have got to deal with your debt.

837
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,280
 So you've gotta decide to be diligent

838
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,000
 and you've gotta decide to deal with debt.

839
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,120
 And then the last decision that we need to make is this,

840
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,120
 is you've gotta decide what will define your story.

841
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,560
 You've gotta decide what will define your story.

842
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,520
 And let me illustrate what I mean by this

843
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,160
 with a little illustration of a story of my buddy Paul.

844
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,520
 There's a buddy of mine that I've known for years.

845
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,600
 And when he graduated from college,

846
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,920
 he got married right after college

847
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,360
 and he and his wife were young, starting their career,

848
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,760
 had no kids and they were ready to live an adventure,

849
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,960
 married together and so they did what a lot of people did

850
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,080
 and where they go seek adventure and they moved to Colorado.

851
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,100
 And they love moving to Colorado and they went out there

852
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,680
 because they love everything that Colorado

853
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,960
 has to offer, they love the hiking and the camping

854
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,000
 and the skiing and the mountain biking,

855
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,560
 they love that whole outdoor vibe

856
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,080
 and so that's where they wanted to go

857
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,400
 as they were starting their life together

858
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,240
 and so they got jobs and they moved out there to Colorado

859
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,520
 and shortly after they got out there,

860
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,440
 they decided they needed to buy a vehicle

861
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,040
 and so what vehicle did they buy

862
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,000
 that was gonna fit this lifestyle that they were living?

863
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,640
 They got a Subaru Outback, right?

864
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,800
 Put the bike rack on it and everything,

865
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,380
 got the stickers on the back and he talked about

866
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,480
 how he loved that Subaru and so now,

867
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,880
 they're out there a few years and that car

868
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,360
 fit their lifestyle perfectly and now it was time for him

869
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,720
 to make some career moves and he was gonna be going back

870
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,300
 to grad school so he moved back here to Dallas.

871
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,400
 At this point, his family had started to grow,

872
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,280
 he'd had a couple of kids and he realized

873
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,200
 the Outback wasn't really practical anymore,

874
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,240
 he needed a little bit bigger car and so his in-laws,

875
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,080
 his in-laws came to him with an opportunity.

876
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,520
 They said, "Listen, we know you need a bigger car,

877
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,040
 "you can't fit all those car seats

878
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,080
 "in the back of the Outback right now."

879
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,560
 So we've got a full-size Lexus SUV

880
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,600
 with less than 100,000 miles and we're gonna sell it

881
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,800
 to you for 5,000 bucks.

882
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,080
 I mean, it was a steal, a steal of a deal

883
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,240
 and so he was like, "Listen, my family needs this,

884
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,080
 "I'll take it."

885
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,920
 So he sold the Outback, he starts driving the Lexus

886
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,440
 and I talked to him a few months after that

887
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,460
 and I'm like, "Man, how's that Lexus?

888
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,300
 "Do you like that thing?"

889
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,840
 And he was like, "I hate it."

890
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,160
 I said, "What do you mean you hate it?

891
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,600
 "Why do you hate the Lexus?"

892
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,520
 He said, "I hate the story that the Lexus

893
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,340
 "tells the world about me."

894
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,600
 'Cause I love that Outback.

895
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,880
 That Outback told the story to the world

896
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,520
 that I wanted the world to know about me.

897
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,480
 That Outback told everybody that I was an outdoorsman,

898
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,640
 that I knew how to mountain bike and I liked hiking

899
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,400
 and I liked camping and I wore a lot of Patagonia

900
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,980
 and I made my own granola, right?

901
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,220
 (congregation laughing)

902
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,280
 Love the story that the Outback told.

903
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,240
 And he goes, "This Lexus, this tells the story

904
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,760
 "like I'm in commercial real estate.

905
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,980
 "I waxed my eyebrows and I graduated from UT."

906
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,320
 (congregation laughing)

907
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,480
 He didn't like the story.

908
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,440
 He didn't like the story and as he's telling that,

909
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,400
 I'm sitting there and I'm laughing

910
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,960
 because I so identify with what he's saying.

911
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,620
 What my buddy Paul realizes is what so many of us in here,

912
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,160
 we maybe just haven't connected the dots

913
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,680
 like my friend Paul had,

914
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,680
 but we think stuff is gonna change our story.

915
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:43,320
 And so this drives so many decisions that we make

916
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,780
 when it comes to purchasing things.

917
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,840
 We wanna be known as somebody that goes to those restaurants.

918
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,280
 We like the story that our apartment tells

919
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,880
 in the part of town that we live in

920
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,480
 and we like the story that it tells

921
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,300
 that we wear this brand of shoes or this brand of clothes

922
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,320
 or we go to this part of the world for vacation.

923
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,200
 And so we just think that stuff is gonna tell our story

924
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,760
 better than we can tell the story

925
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,200
 because secretly what's going on inside all of us

926
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,660
 is we're all a little discontent with our story.

927
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,200
 We compare our story to everybody else's story

928
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,040
 and we're like,

929
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,960
 "Everybody else seems to have a better story than me."

930
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,600
 And so I know how I can change my story

931
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,120
 because I'm a little discontent with my story.

932
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,000
 I'll just get more stuff or I'll just get,

933
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,040
 I'll just, this brand will tell the story

934
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,680
 better than I can tell the story.

935
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,840
 And if we wanna be faithful stewards,

936
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,160
 if we want to make good decisions

937
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,760
 and we have got to decide what we want to define our story.

938
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,280
 And thousands of years ago,

939
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,800
 there were other people that were dealing with this

940
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,880
 with the Apostle Paul, an older Apostle Paul

941
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,080
 talking to a younger Timothy.

942
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,160
 He had some very helpful words that he shared with him

943
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,360
 in 1 Timothy 6 and so let's look at this.

944
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,760
 1 Timothy 6, six through 10, here's what Paul says,

945
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,320
 "But godliness with contentment is great gain."

946
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,840
 Paul is telling Timothy here is listen,

947
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,360
 you're following after God with contentment.

948
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,200
 You're winning if you've got those.

949
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,360
 You're winning if you've got those.

950
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,400
 And then he gives some warnings here and look at verse seven,

951
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,160
 he says, "For we brought nothing into the world

952
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,840
 "and we can take nothing out of it.

953
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,140
 "But if we have food and clothing,

954
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,260
 "we will be content with that.

955
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,840
 "Those who wanna get rich fall into a temptation

956
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,240
 "and a trap into many foolish and harmful desires

957
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,600
 "that plunge people into ruin and destruction."

958
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,700
 Look at that language.

959
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,500
 That is amazing, like clear, scary language.

960
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,420
 In verse 10, "For the love of money

961
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,440
 "is the root of all kinds of evil.

962
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,580
 "Some people eager for more money

963
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,400
 "have wandered from the faith

964
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,700
 "and pierced themselves with many griefs."

965
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,340
 So Paul's reminding Timothy in my way,

966
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,020
 he's still reminding us today that listen,

967
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,640
 you're following God in contentment, you're winning.

968
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,940
 Every single one of us struggles with discontentment

969
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,180
 and all of us will look to stuff

970
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,820
 to try to change that story

971
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,820
 and we think stuff is gonna change that

972
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,340
 and somehow it's gonna satisfy us.

973
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,540
 And Paul says, "If that's the case,

974
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,820
 "it's gonna be really dangerous."

975
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,700
 Because if you think more stuff is gonna change your story,

976
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,940
 then you're gonna have to go get more money.

977
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,420
 And if you keep going after more money,

978
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,100
 it is an endless pit that you will never, ever

979
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,400
 get to the finish line and you will never win.

980
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,460
 This impacts all of us.

981
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,840
 I mean, I even just think about my own life with all of this

982
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,020
 and how I need this personal reminder

983
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,420
 and it's just to bring this story kind of full circle.

984
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,860
 So last year I saved up a bunch of money

985
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,420
 and I bought a different vehicle,

986
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,900
 I bought a used vehicle and guess what I bought?

987
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,940
 I bought an Outback.

988
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,060
 And guess what I feel every single day

989
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,900
 when I drive that Outback?

990
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,120
 I feel like a fraud.

991
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,220
 Look at me.

992
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,520
 [congregation laughing]

993
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,020
 I hate camping.

994
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,480
 [congregation laughing]

995
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,800
 I don't wear a lot of Patagonia.

996
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,300
 I don't even have a real beard for crying out loud.

997
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,820
 And I feel like I'm out there

998
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,080
 trying to be some outdoor poser.

999
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,840
 And I literally, I mean, just to be vulnerable,

1000
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,480
 I've literally had this conversation of going,

1001
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,360
 this car's telling the wrong story.

1002
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,640
 I need to go get more money so I can change my story.

1003
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,200
 I think I'm kind of a Camry guy, right?

1004
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,180
 Like nice and boring.

1005
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,360
 That's probably me.

1006
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,440
 And I'm just buying the lie

1007
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,720
 that stuff is gonna change my story

1008
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,120
 and tell my story better than I can.

1009
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,320
 And listen, there's this discontentment that's in all of us

1010
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,820
 and what Paul goes on to say

1011
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,720
 is there is a cure for discontentment.

1012
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,420
 And hear this, the cure for discontentment is Christ.

1013
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,260
 That's the cure.

1014
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,720
 Look at what he says here in verse 11.

1015
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,960
 He says, "But you man of God,"

1016
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,480
 reminding Timothy of his story.

1017
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,240
 You are a man of God, that's your story.

1018
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,200
 You man of God, flee from all of this.

1019
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,000
 Flee from this pursuing after,

1020
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
 this endless pursuit of money.

1021
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,200
 Flee from that, turn your back on that,

1022
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,380
 and here's what I want you to pursue.

1023
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,840
 Righteousness, godliness, faith, love,

1024
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,520
 endurance, and gentleness.

1025
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,160
 Fight the good fight of faith.

1026
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,040
 And I love that language.

1027
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,720
 That if you're gonna try to live counter-cultural

1028
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,960
 when it comes to this relationship

1029
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,880
 with money and possessions, it is going to be a fight.

1030
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,080
 It is not gonna be easy.

1031
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,320
 But he says to fight this good fight,

1032
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,360
 take hold of eternal life for which you were called

1033
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,040
 when you made your good confession

1034
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,460
 in the presence of many witnesses.

1035
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,120
 He's saying, listen, Timothy,

1036
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,720
 the cure for your discontentment is Jesus.

1037
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,560
 That's the cure.

1038
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,200
 So you decide to be diligent.

1039
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,460
 You decide to deal with your debt,

1040
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,640
 and you decide what's gonna define your story.

1041
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,760
 And stuff, stuff is not gonna define your story.

1042
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,920
 You make those decisions,

1043
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,320
 and this decade can be really, really different.

1044
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,120
 So June 20th, 2004, my wife and I,

1045
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,400
 we get in that car, and we head home,

1046
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,080
 and we start running some numbers,

1047
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,360
 and just go, okay, we wanna do something about this debt.

1048
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,620
 We wanna deal with it.

1049
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,680
 So we ran some numbers and came up

1050
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680
 with a bunch of different scenarios of what we could do,

1051
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,180
 and we gathered some friends together,

1052
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,380
 and we got in the living room,

1053
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,400
 and we slid another sheet of paper

1054
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,720
 across the table to some people,

1055
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,100
 and said, listen, this is what we can do.

1056
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,160
 Option A right now is I'll drop out of seminary,

1057
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,280
 I'll go back into accounting,

1058
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,120
 Jackie will leave the nonprofit world.

1059
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,960
 That'd be option A.

1060
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,880
 It'd be a lot of change, but we're willing to do that.

1061
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,000
 We think if we did that, we can maybe throw this much.

1062
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,920
 We were looking primarily at that income number,

1063
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,200
 going, I think we can change that,

1064
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,580
 so let's try to change that.

1065
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,560
 Option B, I'll just finish seminary,

1066
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,640
 and then we'll deal with it later.

1067
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,180
 Option C, we'll hope that I've got some long-lost relative

1068
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,280
 that's about to die that I don't know.

1069
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,960
 He's gonna leave me some money.

1070
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,880
 So what do you think we should do?

1071
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,080
 And our friends looked at us, and they said,

1072
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,960
 listen, if you're willing to do option A,

1073
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,040
 we'd say do option A.

1074
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,740
 And we said, great, we'll do that.

1075
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,040
 So from June 2004 to November 2004,

1076
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,160
 I was, by the grace of God, was able to find a job

1077
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,780
 back in accounting, dropped out of seminary.

1078
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,680
 My wife was able to find a job in corporate America.

1079
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,300
 She went from being an attorney to being a legal secretary.

1080
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,240
 Took this huge title cut,

1081
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,940
 but it gave a little bit of a pay raise,

1082
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,880
 and that's what we needed.

1083
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,720
 And so November 2004, when we were,

1084
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,300
 our net worth was negative $120,000,

1085
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,920
 we made our first aggressive debt payment.

1086
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,160
 And then in March of 2008, we made our last debt payment,

1087
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,700
 and our net worth was zero.

1088
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,200
 (congregation applauding)

1089
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,880
 And I'm telling you guys,

1090
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,740
 it never felt so good to be worthless.

1091
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,080
 (congregation laughing)

1092
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:35,680
 So our relationship with money and possessions,

1093
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,060
 it's not just a numbers issue, it's a heart issue,

1094
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,860
 and we wanna be faithful stewards.

1095
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,940
 If we're gonna be faithful stewards,

1096
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,040
 and we've gotta decide to be diligent, 'cause it's not ours.

1097
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,440
 Just this culture we live in, things can get out of control.

1098
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,000
 We gotta decide to deal with our debt,

1099
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,320
 and we've gotta decide what's gonna define our story.

1100
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,480
 And the best financial decisions you could ever make

1101
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,560
 is to root your story and your identity

1102
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,360
 in the person of Jesus Christ, amen?

1103
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,840
 Amen, let me pray that we'll do that.

1104
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,940
 So Lord, we thank you.

1105
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,920
 We thank you that your word is so practical for our lives,

1106
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,400
 and so helpful for our lives.

1107
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,020
 And so I pray, God, that you will help us to be diligent,

1108
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,280
 that you will help those of us in this room here tonight

1109
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,120
 that are in debt, that you will help us

1110
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,320
 to deal with that debt.

1111
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,080
 And God, I pray that you will help us

1112
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,360
 to root our identity in who you are,

1113
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,080
 and that we will understand

1114
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,440
 that stuff doesn't tell our story, Jesus tells our story.

1115
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,720
 And so God, I pray that you will help our hearts

1116
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,020
 that are so prone to wander in discontentment.

1117
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,480
 We need you to do that.

1118
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,080
 So this is what we pray, in Christ's name, amen.

1119
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:56,080
