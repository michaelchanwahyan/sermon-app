[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   Good evening and welcome to the porch. I'm here to guide you on your journey
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.480]   through the complex world of relationships. Can we cue some music
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.680]   please? From our friendships to our romantic endeavors, we'll explore our
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.760]   family bonds, estranged relationships, work dynamics, and perhaps even the
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.840]   relationship with oneself. So how do we relate? To answer this, we'll look to
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.560]   scripture and find exactly what God has to say about our relationships. This is
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.280]   After All, the Relationship Series. Porch, how we doing tonight? We doing all right?
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.640]   Good to see you. Hey, thanks so much for always making time to be with us here on
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.440]   your Tuesday evening or whatever evening it is that you're tuning in with us
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.240]   because we know so many of you are not just here in the room, though it's great
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.880]   to see all of you. Some of you are also tuning in online, especially our Porch
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.480]   Live community. Can we give it up for Porch Live? Porch, you should be amazing. Special
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.840]   shout out to Porch Live Des Moines, Porch Live Dayton, and Porch Live Greater
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040]   Lafayette. We love you guys and we're so glad that you'd be with us. Hey, if this is
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.240]   your first time here, if you're jumping in midstream through our series right
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.600]   now, we have been journeying through, yes you guessed it, the Relationship Series.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.200]   And what we've been doing as we've been walking through this series is we've
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.400]   been asking what is God's design for how we're meant to connect with each other?
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.760]   Not just in dating and romantic relationships, though that's very
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.920]   important, but also in all manner of relationships. The variety of different
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.880]   opportunities we have to interact with one another in life, whether it's
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.400]   friendships or it's dating or it's marriage or it's work or it's the
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.040]   relationship you have with yourself. That's the idea of this series. And
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.640]   tonight we're gonna be diving into your relationship with family. And to help us
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.480]   do it, we have invited a very special guest to teach us this evening. Before I
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.440]   tell you who it is, I do just want to lead with this. When I was considering
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.680]   whether or not I would make the move to Dallas, Texas to join the team here at
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.880]   The Porch, this individual was a big selling point for why we felt it was a
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.280]   good reason to come. Because this guy is not just intellectually acquainted with
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.960]   God, though he is, and you'll see that, he is intimately acquainted with God. He's
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.000]   deeply enchanted with the person of Jesus, and so I'm really excited for y'all
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.400]   to hear from my good friend, Dr. Orin Martin. Yes, Orin is a dear friend to me.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.680]   He's a former professor at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary where he
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.120]   taught on theology. He also is now the senior director of equipping here at
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.880]   Watermark Community Church, and so you can learn from him yourself, not just
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.600]   tonight, but in other areas of the church as well. But before he comes up, I do just
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.960]   want to read to us the scripture that we're gonna be studying together. So if
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.160]   you have a Bible, would you turn with me to Mark chapter 3? Mark is one of the
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.600]   four Gospels that we find in the New Testament, and so if you're looking for
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.000]   it, you can turn to the New Testament. You'll see Matthew, and then you'll see
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.520]   Mark, and we're gonna be early into the book. So this is what it says in Mark
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.160]   chapter 3. If you don't have a Bible, that's okay. You can follow it on the
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.360]   screens, but Mark chapter 3, and we're gonna pick it up in verse 20. This is
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.580]   Jesus. It's saying, "Then he," talking about Jesus Christ, "went home and the crowd
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.800]   gathered again so that they could not even eat." It's a lot of people. "And when
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.040]   his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, 'He is
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.840]   out of his mind.' And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, 'He is
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.400]   possessed by Bilzebul, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.' And he
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.000]   called them to him, and he said to them in parables, 'How can Satan cast out Satan?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.280]   If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.960]   is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. And if Satan
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.120]   has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.800]   an end. But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods unless
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.840]   he first binds the strong man, then indeed he may plunder his house. Truly I
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.600]   say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man. And whatever blasphemies
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.920]   they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.440]   forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin. For they were saying, 'He has an
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.000]   unclean spirit.'" Verse 31, "And his mother and his brothers came. And standing
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.280]   outside, they sent to him and called him. And a crowd was sitting around him, and
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.320]   they said to him, 'Your mother and your brothers are outside seeking you.' And he
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.720]   answered them, 'Who are my mother and my brothers?' And looking about those who sat
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.360]   around him, he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.840]   of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.'" Let me pray for us. Well, Father,
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.560]   we're eager to learn what this Scripture has to teach us tonight, and I believe,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.200]   Lord, that every word we just read has deep relevance for every person here
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.080]   tonight. I pray, God, that you would open our eyes to see the beauty of Christ as
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.400]   we study through this passage together. I pray, God, you would help us to know how
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.520]   we are to interact with our own families as Jesus. We are now a part of your family
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.480]   for those that place their faith in you. God, I'm so grateful for every soul here.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.200]   Thank you, God, for my friend Orrin Martin, that he would give the time to come and
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.400]   teach us this evening. Pray that you would fill him with your Spirit, you
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.840]   would lead him along, and he would speak, God, your truth. It's in Jesus' name we
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   pray. Amen. Porch, would you welcome my good friend, Dr. Orrin Martin?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:41.560]   - Good evening. How are we doing? That was actually kind of a little bit weak.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:50.400]   How are we doing? All right, that's better. It is so good to be here with you all.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.960]   Kylin, welcome to everyone. So, you don't have to do all the obligatory welcome
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.680]   Porch, Porch Live, you already did that. We're thankful. So, it is not lost on me
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:08.400]   that we have a full room of people who are here to gather to sing God's Word, to
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.280]   hear God's Word. That is amazing, so thank you. We don't take that privilege lightly,
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.800]   and it is a joy to be able to open God's Word with you. So, as Kylin said, we are
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.680]   continuing the series on relationships. We've talked about friendships, we've
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.840]   talked about marriage. Tonight, we're talking about family. Now, there are
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.400]   probably a few in here who are not originally from Dallas. If you're not from
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.360]   Dallas, if Dallas is not your hometown, would you raise your hand? Yes, I would
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.720]   raise my hand too. That is actually more than I expected. I'm a little bit
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:56.320]   overwhelmed right now. I may have to go home. No, I am in that same boat with you.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.800]   As a result, we can often, and it's very common, we can often try to find our
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.440]   family elsewhere. Where do people try to find it? Well, you may think of gyms, you
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.320]   may think of CrossFit, you might think of some kind of running clubs or book clubs.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.160]   Maybe not book clubs, some of you are people like me. These groups often gather
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.400]   around common interests. But as Christians, those who claim the name of
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:33.000]   Christ, where do we find it? What does that mean for us? What does it mean for
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.200]   our natural or earthly nuclear families? Well, our passage tonight helps us answer
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.760]   these questions. Before we do that, I know Kylin prayed, but just from my own heart,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.840]   would you just join me in prayer real quick? I'm going to pray actually from Psalm
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:08:00.560]   123. To you, O Lord, we lift up our eyes. Lord, we confess that oftentimes we lift
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.240]   up our eyes and we just see obstacles, we see conflict, we see difficulties, we see
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:13.080]   suffering. And so, Lord, we acknowledge that it's good to lift up our eyes
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:20.680]   because it is you who are enthroned in the heavens. You reign above it all.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.640]   Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:32.440]   maid servant to the hand of her mistress. O God, our eyes look to you, to the Lord,
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:39.840]   our God, till you have mercy on us. So we ask, Lord, tonight that you would have
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.960]   mercy on us, O Lord, that you would have mercy on us. Lift our eyes to see Jesus
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.400]   in all of his glory and beauty and splendor. Fix our eyes on him. And it's in
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:01.240]   his name that I ask. Amen. Well, let me just tell you a little bit about myself.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:07.760]   I was raised, born and raised in Houston, Texas. That's what I love to hear.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:15.440]   I had a wonderful family and I was so thankful for the gift that the Lord gave
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:22.520]   me in the gift of my parents who were believers, my older sister, who I guess
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.000]   I'm thankful for. I mean, as younger brothers, do we have to be thankful for
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.560]   our older sister? Yes, I have a wonderful sister. If you're listening, Shiloh, I
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:36.280]   love you, even though you've scarred me for life. When I was 18 years old, my
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:45.800]   father passed away. He died of AIDS that he contracted through a lot of sin. And
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.400]   he was hiding from us, from our family, was living a double life. And my family,
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.640]   in the wake of that, blew apart. My mother, pretty soon after, remarried an
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:02.760]   unbeliever. As a result of that, I was angry. I was an angry 18-year-old who was
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:08.360]   still grieving over the loss of my best friend. And she had the audacity to do
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:14.880]   what she had always instructed us to do, not to date, not to marry someone who
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:21.080]   doesn't follow Jesus. And so what do we do? Me and my sister, we cut her off. We
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.640]   didn't talk to her for three years. And my life for about three years just
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:33.520]   spiraled downward. I was hopeless. I was seeking joy. I was seeking
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.880]   contentment. I was seeking to numb the pain of my grief from anything and
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:47.640]   everything the world could throw at me. And I was hopeless. And one day, my
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.000]   sister, who lived up in College Station, she and her husband were students at,
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:59.640]   yes, Texas A&M University. And like a great older sister does, she called me
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:06.960]   and she said, "Oren, you are an idiot. You're living like a fool." She saw my
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.720]   hopeless state. I'd actually been just fired from my job for stealing car parts
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.120]   to sell on the side because I was racing cars and we sold them for car parts and
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.360]   it's a big Mustang ring. And that wasn't actually one of my notes. I just felt
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:27.400]   like saying that. Give me some street cred maybe. And so let's just say I was
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:34.280]   not in a good place. I was unemployed. I didn't have a home. And I felt like if
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.400]   you've seen the movie Dumb and Dumber, you know, we got no food, we got no
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:43.120]   clothes, our pet's heads are falling off. That's how I felt. And so my sister was
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.720]   like, "Why don't you move up with us?" And so just really out of feeling like I
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.680]   didn't have anywhere else to go, I moved up with my sister and husband and she
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.560]   said, "You're welcome to live with us on one condition that you go to church with
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.120]   us." I was like, "Fine. All right. Free room and board." So I started going to
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.720]   church with my sister. And after about a year, I had heard something. God opened
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.800]   my ears to hear what I hadn't heard before. He opened my eyes to see what I
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.480]   hadn't seen before. And that was the beauty and the glory of Christ who came
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.760]   to die for a sinner like me. He lived the life that I couldn't live. He obeyed
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.960]   perfectly in my place. He died the death for my sin that I deserve to die. And he
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:35.080]   was raised from the dead. And so through trusting in him, through giving my life
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:41.560]   to him by receiving him, God filled me with something I had not had before. Joy.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:51.600]   Peace. Love. Acceptance. Security. Assurance. And even more, he gave me a
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:13:00.240]   family. That church became my family in the wake of not having a family. And in
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.680]   the subsequent years, I saw the Lord work in my life and through my life, in my
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.480]   family's life, and he brought my mom's husband to faith in Christ. And he
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.200]   restored my mom's and I's relationship. And by God's grace, we have an incredible
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.480]   relationship. She actually texted me yesterday and asked me a question that
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.960]   after we died, do we get wings? It's a great question. I was like, Oh, Lord,
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:31.040]   have mercy. No, we don't have wings. Right. But I come to you tonight and tell
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:38.520]   you what a glorious Savior we have. God did not spare his own son. How will he
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.720]   not also with him freely, graciously give us all things? And one of those
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.040]   wonderful gifts is the gift of family. So that's what I want to focus our
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.680]   attention on tonight. Here's my main point that I want to talk about tonight.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:59.240]   Jesus is making a new family on earth gathered around himself, and he's doing
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:05.280]   it with outsiders. And that changes everything. I'll repeat it. Jesus is
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.720]   making a new family on earth gathered around himself, and he's doing it with
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:16.280]   outsiders. And that changes everything. But before we get there, we need to clear
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.040]   some ground. Because as you notice, as Kylin said, we're in Mark chapter three,
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.680]   which means there's two chapters that come before this. So we need to get our
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.280]   bearings a little bit and understand where we are in the context of Mark.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.000]   Okay, Mark's very first words in chapter one, verse one, you don't have to turn
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.800]   there, are the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the son of God. That's
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.040]   like the title of his book. This is what his gospel is about. Gospel just means
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.320]   good news. And so what Mark is saying is this is the beginning of the good news,
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.560]   the gospel of Jesus Christ, the son of God. Now, why is it good news? Mark spends
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:59.480]   the next 15 chapters telling us why it's good news. And basically, the gospel is
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:05.680]   good news, because God did what you and I couldn't do. That's the gist of the
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:14.480]   gospel. That God did for us what we could not do for our self. And he just goes off
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:21.520]   for 15 chapters, painting a glorious picture of who this God is, the very son
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:28.880]   of God. That God, in the person of the son, became flesh. As John says, the word
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   became flesh and tabernacled among us, who templed among us. That is the eternal
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:41.440]   son who's from the father, was sent from the father in time to become man and live
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.200]   the life that we couldn't live, die the death that we deserve to die. And Mark
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.760]   paints a beautiful picture about he is the better king. He is the better son. He
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:56.920]   brings God's kingdom, God's rule, God's authority to earth. And that is a good
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.520]   thing. And he shows us in detail after detail how Jesus is the authoritative
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.160]   king who has authority over sin and authority over death and authority over
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.320]   Satan and authority over evil and authority over creation and authority
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.440]   over unclean spirits and authority over disease. He has authority over everything
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.520]   and everyone. And this brought all kinds of responses. So even in Mark chapter
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.800]   three, in the text we're in, by then people are questioning him. They're
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.840]   accusing him. They don't really understand who he is. They're confused
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.640]   about him. Some recognize him. And it's actually interesting that the only
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   people who recognize him up to this point are the unclean spirits. They
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.960]   confess him. You are the Christ, the Messiah, the king, the holy one of Israel.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.440]   Everybody else is kind of like, what's going on? Who is this guy? He's making
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:56.200]   these amazing claims. In our passage tonight, we'll see what his family
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:03.400]   thought of him and how Jesus responded. So it's important to know the context
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.880]   where we are in Mark. But it's also secondly, important to see how Mark
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.000]   makes our main point tonight, that Jesus makes a new family gather around
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.920]   himself. It's important to see how Mark makes his main point, and we cannot miss
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.120]   it. You probably got confused a little bit when Colin was reading. And there's
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:27.880]   a point for that. If you notice, Mark introduces his family in verses 20 and
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:33.720]   21. When he says his family heard all that Jesus was saying, and they were
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.280]   seeing all that Jesus were doing, and they went out to seize him. That's a
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.520]   word that's used throughout the rest of his gospel to arrest him, to control
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:51.080]   him, to take charge of him. Why? Because they were saying he is out of his mind.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:57.240]   His family thought he was nuts. He was crazy. So Mark introduces his family in
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.880]   verses 20 and 21. But then he immediately jumps to the story about him being
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:08.960]   accused of working with Satan. Kind of an abrupt shift. But then after he deals
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:16.440]   with that story in verses 31 through 35, Mark jumps back to his family and tells
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.680]   us their response. It kind of feels like we're, here's family, and then here's
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.400]   Satan accusing him, and Jesus responding, and then going back to his family. What's
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.880]   going on here? Well, I'm so glad you asked. This is a literary device Mark
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.640]   frequently uses throughout his gospel called a Mark sandwich. You can write
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.160]   that down. It's actually a pretty technical theological term, but it
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.240]   sounds funny. Who didn't like sandwiches? Well, Mark likes sandwiches. And he does
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.560]   it all throughout his gospel. What do I mean by that? This is a literary device
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.800]   he uses to make a point. So stay with me here. The middle of the sandwich, so
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:19:02.400]   verses 22 to 30, help us understand the outside of the sandwich. The middle of
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.560]   the sandwich helps us interpret and understand and apply and receive the
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:15.920]   main point of the text. So what do I mean by that? Well, while his family is trying
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:22.160]   to control him, there's the outside of this other sandwich, and the scribes are
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:31.040]   accusing him of being on the same team as Satan, and they're rejecting him, Jesus in
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:38.080]   the middle out kings them all and displays his unrivaled control and
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:44.880]   authority. It is a brilliant literary point to make. Mark is telling us in the
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:52.920]   middle of this story that Jesus is the strong man who plunders and destroys the
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:20:00.600]   so-called strong man of this age. Do you see that? He says in verse 27, "No one can
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.520]   enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods." He's referring here to Satan,
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:14.720]   to evil activity, unless he first binds the strong man. Well, that assumes that
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.680]   this strong man who's bound is bound by a stronger man. It's interesting that
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.920]   back in Mark chapter 1 verse 7, John the Baptist says, "You know what? As great as I
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:28.680]   am, there's one coming after me, and he is mightier, stronger than I." And Mark is
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:35.480]   telling us who this mightier one, who is this stronger one is. The stronger one is
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:44.640]   Jesus. And in this passage, the ones who think they're insiders, on one hand his
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:50.080]   his blood family, and on the other hand the scribes from Jerusalem, I mean
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:57.360]   they're God's people, right? Israel. The ones who think that they're insiders,
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:05.560]   family and scribes, are in reality outsiders. And Jesus seizes the moment to
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:13.480]   reveal who the true insiders are. So we have to see what Jesus is doing. Why? Why
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:19.520]   is this important to his audience and to us? Well, at that time it appeared that
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:26.160]   Satan had won. Do you see what they say? They accuse him, verse 22, that
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:31.160]   he's possessed by Beelzebul, by the prince of demons. And by the prince of
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.280]   demons, he cast out demons. And he called them and said to them in parables, and he
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.640]   tells this story. How can Satan cast out Satan? And he quotes those famous words
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.760]   of Abraham Lincoln. "If a kingdom is divided against itself, the king..." I'm just
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:49.680]   kidding. Abraham Lincoln got it from him. Just making sure you're following. "If a
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.400]   house divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand." Maybe in
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.800]   contemporary terms, a basketball player is not going to score in his own goal. Or
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.320]   a football player is not going to score in his own end zone. Or if you're like my
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.320]   daughter and she loves Dancing with the Stars, a dance team is not going to score
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   points for the other dance team. I think I got that right. They're over there. She
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:19.880]   can correct me later. Jesus is exposing their absurdity. If I were on the
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:27.840]   same team as Satan, then why would I be working against Satan? That's his point.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:36.800]   And that's an important point. Because these people have been under the
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.520]   dominion of Satan in satanic activity for generation after generation after
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.560]   generation. I mean, just imagine if you know the history of Israel, it wasn't a
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.360]   pretty history. Going all the way back to the Garden of Eden, where God created
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:57.160]   Adam and Eve to have life with him and fellowship with him. Instead of
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.320]   listening to his word, they listened to the word of a serpent. Did God really say?
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:07.480]   And instead of believing God, instead of taking God at his word, they took the
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:15.120]   word of the serpent and unleashed a world of sin and death in their wake. It
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.040]   began with their own children. Cain and Abel. Cain murdered Abel. And it just
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:27.240]   continued and escalated after him. Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, the nation
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:36.960]   of Israel, David. Every person after Adam and Eve fell into sin was a sinner and
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:43.920]   died just like their parents. And the Old Testament ends with Israel in exile, away
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.720]   from the promised land, away from the promises of God, because they were under
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.960]   the rule and dominion of Satan. And they've been waiting. They've been
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.200]   waiting for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years. When is God going to
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.560]   fulfill his promises? When is the Messiah? When is the king going to come
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.960]   and display his authority and put the other kingdoms down? We're tired of being
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.720]   ruled by Babylonians and the Assyrians and the Medo-Persians and in Jesus' day,
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:17.200]   the Romans. We're tired of it. We need the king to come in long fulfillment and
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.240]   anticipation of God's promises and prophecies of a king who would come and
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:32.120]   break into history and save his people from worldly dominion. And so it appeared
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:40.280]   at this time that Satan had won. And Mark shows us in wonderful ways that end
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:49.360]   steps the son of God. The word who became flesh. In fact, John's gospel tells us
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:55.760]   that that he is the light who shines in the darkness and the darkness did not
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:03.240]   overcome it. Friends, this was the king that they had been waiting for. This was
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:08.960]   the king that they needed. But unfortunately, it's not the king they
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:15.760]   wanted. They wanted a king who would deliver them from Rome. But Jesus is a
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:25.960]   greater king who delivers them from sin, Satan and death. And Jesus shows the
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:35.200]   folly of their accusation. And Jesus says that anyone who condemns the ministry of
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:42.800]   Jesus as the ministry of Satan is guilty of an eternal sin. This is what it means.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.840]   Real quick. This is what it means to blaspheme the Holy Spirit. Because the
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:53.400]   Spirit, John tells us, works to glorify and to exalt Jesus. Jesus says, "When I
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.520]   leave after my death and resurrection, I'm going to send you another helper, the
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.080]   Spirit of truth, and he will, he will indwell you. He will not just be with you,
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.880]   he will be in you. And he will take from me and he will make it known to you. He
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.040]   will guide you into all truth." And he did that. He guided the disciples in the
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.320]   truth, and they wrote that truth down. And this is what we have in the pages of
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:21.480]   the New Testament. And so this is what it means to blaspheme the Holy Spirit
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.440]   because the Spirit works to glorify Jesus. In the words of J.I. Packer, the
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:32.400]   Spirit's work is a spotlight work. The Spirit's ministry is a spotlight
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:39.160]   ministry. In other words, the Spirit exists to shine the light on Jesus, not
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:46.880]   to glorify himself. To shine the light on Jesus. And so to reject the Holy
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:56.200]   Spirit is to reject Jesus. And to reject Jesus is to reject God himself. But
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:03.720]   there's hope. Look at verse 28. "Truly I say to you, all kinds of sins will be
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.200]   forgiven the children of man. And whatever blasphemies they utter, but
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.440]   whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:23.560]   guilty of an eternal sin." Do you see that? People get worried about, "Oh, did
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.240]   I commit the eternal sin? Did I commit that blasphemy?" Let me just say it in
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.520]   clearest terms. If you're worried about that, you haven't committed it. It
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.160]   actually should give you great assurance because blasphemy against the Holy
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:42.120]   Spirit is finally rejecting the work of the Spirit who shines his light on Jesus
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:51.160]   and thus is to reject Jesus. And Jesus says, "I will forgive all sins and
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:57.720]   blasphemies." This is an amazing story. Do you remember the story of Stephen in
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:05.920]   Acts chapter 7, who preached probably one of the best sermons ever? Stephen is
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.360]   accusing the unbelieving Jews, unbelieving Israel for resisting the
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:18.440]   Holy Spirit because they were rejecting Jesus. He says, "You always resist the
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:25.800]   Holy Spirit, just like your fathers always did." And it's amazing that it goes
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.840]   on a few verses later and tells us that there is a man in the crowd who stood
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:37.560]   and looked approvingly at all that was happening. And what had happened is they
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:43.800]   murdered Stephen. He's one of the first martyrs of the church. Do you know who
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:56.560]   that man was? His name was Saul. And Saul would be renamed Paul, depending on where
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:03.040]   he went to share the gospel. And Paul was that man that Jesus comes to just a
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.360]   couple of chapters later and says, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?" And
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:16.280]   Jesus saves him. Jesus forgives him. Jesus gives Saul his very righteousness so
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:24.200]   that Saul, once an enemy of Jesus, is now a friend. Do you get what's going on?
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:32.440]   Jesus shows up and has mercy on him. And friends, Paul never got over it. He says,
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.000]   "I'm the least of the apostles. By God's grace, I am what I am. I am the chief of
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.600]   sinners, but Jesus had mercy on me." Friends, marvel at God's mercy. If you
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.960]   are here tonight, no matter where you've been, no matter what you've done, as
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:55.880]   Richard Sibbes says, "There is more mercy in Christ than sin in you." Do you believe
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:04.320]   that? There is more mercy in Christ than there is sin in you. So what's the call?
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:10.360]   Go to Jesus where there is mercy to forgive. Go to Jesus where there is mercy
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:18.160]   to help. Go to Jesus where there is an unending fount of mercy to endure, to
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:27.600]   give you wisdom, to give you assurance. Okay. Man, I don't know what's up with my
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.800]   voice. I haven't preached in a long time. Okay, so let's turn our attention back on
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:40.760]   the main point that Mark is making, that Jesus is plundering Satan's house to
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.760]   make a new family for himself, gathered around himself. And he's doing it with
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.800]   outsiders. This is why we're here tonight, and this is what I will focus the rest of
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.960]   our time on. This is what I want us to see, because this point changes
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:01.560]   everything, particularly in relationships with our families, parents, siblings, and
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.720]   everyone else. So with the rest of our time together, let me just point out
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:12.240]   three things. First, this is gonna blow your minds. Are you ready for this? The
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:20.120]   first point we have to see from this text is that Jesus had a family. Is that
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.600]   amazing? You're like, "Really? You taught theology, and this is what you came here
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.800]   to say?" You're like, "Yeah, we already knew that." Well, it's actually interesting that
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.760]   in the early church, that's one of the most predominant heresies. Actually, in
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.680]   1 John, it says that anyone who denies that Jesus has come in the flesh, he is
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:45.120]   the Antichrist. There was a whole host of heresies. You can study them. One's called
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.240]   monophysitism. The other one's called ebionitism. The other one's called
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:55.080]   docetism. They denied his humanity. Now you're thinking, "Yeah, this is what we
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:00.400]   paid for. Give us some good theological terms." No, that's important. That's why
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.040]   all the creeds, the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, the Caledonian Creed, and
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:10.680]   the first five centuries of the church confessed Jesus was genuinely, truly,
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:14.760]   fully human. He was born of the Virgin Mary, conceived by the Holy Spirit. Why?
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:21.640]   Because they denied it. So it was very theologically important to affirm that
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:28.720]   Jesus was and is truly and fully human. But there's also a very practical point
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:35.280]   for us tonight. Jesus knew what it was like to have a family and all the
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:41.320]   dynamics that come as a result of being part of one. Notice the mess of Jesus's
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:47.680]   family. They tried to seize him. They thought he was crazy. They thought he was
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.760]   out of his mind. They thought he had lost his marbles. And it's
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:58.120]   helpful that Mark just doesn't airbrush that out of Jesus's family. He
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:02.080]   wasn't concerned with putting up an Instagram page where it just kind of
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.680]   looks like Jesus's family is perfect. They go on family vacation. They all get
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:11.360]   along. They sing kumbaya. There's no conflict. There's no arguments. Mom and
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:16.000]   Dad love each other. Siblings never fight. Yeah, right. Raise your hand if
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.960]   you've ever had a vacation like that. Not many of us, I don't think. I sure haven't.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:27.440]   And I love my family. That may be the way of social media, but it's not
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:33.320]   reality. The truth is family life is complicated. It's hard. It's stressful.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.880]   It's messy. We are sinners. We sin against them. They are sinners. They sin
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.000]   against us. And when they sin against us, we're sinners. We respond sinfully. And we
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.880]   respond sinfully. They respond sinfully. And there's just like a cycle. And it's
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:55.160]   extremely helpful to see something of the messiness of Jesus's family. It's
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:01.280]   actually an amazing comfort. Hebrews 4, 15 and 16 says that we do not have a high
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.760]   priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.600]   in all things as we are, yet without sin. I'm sure that drove his brothers and
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:17.560]   sisters crazy. He was perfect. He was without sin. But friends, that's a
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:25.800]   comfort. He can sympathize with our weaknesses. He knew what it was like for
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:32.680]   his family to need saving. Does your family need saving? So did his. Does your
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:38.160]   family have conflict? So did his. Does your family think you're crazy? So did
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:45.040]   his. Now, you may be. I don't know. I'm not a judge of that. Some of you may have
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.960]   left your old life of sin to find your new life in Jesus. And it's coming to
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:56.040]   cost. That happened to me. When I didn't enjoy the sin that I used to enjoy, my
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   family was like, "You're a dud. You're no fun anymore." Do you struggle with
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:08.480]   misunderstanding, being misunderstood, tension, stress, conflict? Go to Jesus
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:13.640]   with your burdens and your anxieties, and he will give you out of his own
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:19.000]   abundance what you need. The second point that we see from this passage is that
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.120]   Jesus makes a new family gathered around himself, and he's doing it without
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:30.520]   fighters. This is what we see in verses 31 through 35, and this is a staggering
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:36.480]   claim. I mean, think about family in Jesus's day. Think about how important it
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.880]   was for you to be identified as an Israelite. I mean, after all, they were
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.000]   God's chosen people. They were God's treasured possessions. In Exodus 4.22,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.560]   it's called Israel God's son. They weren't like those Gentiles, those
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:58.240]   outsiders, those nations that aren't Israel. What's going on here? Well, when
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.200]   Jesus says to them, right, as his mother and his brothers came standing outside
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.040]   and sent to him and called him, and a crowd was sitting around him, and they
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   said to him, "Your mother and your brothers are outside seeking you," and he
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.440]   answers, "who are my mother and my brothers." And looking about at those who
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.440]   sat around him, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers. Whoever does the
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:22.240]   will of God, he is my brother and my sister and my mother." What's going on
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:28.520]   here? Is Jesus just trashing his family? He's like, "Y'all are dead to me." No, Jesus
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.400]   isn't saying that. In fact, if you go and read throughout the other three
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:39.200]   Gospels, it shows us that Jesus has a deep love and concern for his family.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.440]   Jesus's first miracle in John was a miracle at a wedding, and his mother was
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:50.240]   like, "Jesus, we're out of wine." And Jesus is like, "Well, it's not really time yet," but
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:56.280]   he grants her her request. Fast forward to the end of the Gospel. You remember
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.880]   what Jesus says as he's hanging on the cross? He looks down at his mother and he
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:08.280]   says to his mother, "Mother, behold your son." And he says to the Apostle John, his
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:14.320]   beloved disciple, "John, behold your mother." Do you get what's going on here? Think
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:20.040]   about it. In his final breaths, Jesus was caring for his mother. He's saying, "Mom,
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:25.200]   John's gonna care for you. John, care for my mother." Why? Because he loved and cared
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.840]   deeply for his family. Perhaps he was thinking about that Old Testament
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.160]   passage in Exodus 20 where it says that the children are to honor their father
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:40.280]   and their mother. We see that in this moment, caring for, looking after, having a
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:46.840]   deep love and concern for his mother. So what's happening here? Here's what's
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:52.560]   happening. Though Jesus loved his family, his primary relationship and allegiance
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:58.480]   was to his father. And the saving mission he came to accomplish, in other words, the
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.840]   gospel was paramount. The gospel was primary in Jesus's purpose and saving
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:10.320]   mission. Though he loved his earthly family, they could not distract him from
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:18.760]   his saving mission. In John 17, too, he prays, "Father, the hour has come." He's
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.280]   praying to his eternal father as the eternal son. "Father, the hour has come.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:29.080]   Glorify your son that the Son may glorify you." Why? Because you've given him
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:37.880]   authority over all flesh to give eternal life to whom you have given him. Jesus,
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:45.000]   though he loved his family, came to make a new one. A family from every tribe and
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.800]   language and nation and people. That's amazing. And so what's for us here?
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:39:01.160]   What do we say about this new family that Jesus came to make? It's interesting
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:05.120]   that as you go on to read the New Testament, the church is described in
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:12.520]   beautiful familial terms. The church is a household of faith. The church is composed
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:18.680]   of believers who unite themselves together under mutual obligations to
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.480]   love each other and bear one another's burdens and grieve with each other and
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.880]   weep with each other and rejoice with one another and to care for each other
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:31.680]   and what are they called? Brothers and sisters in Christ. He calls the older
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.400]   women of the church to be mothers to the younger women of the church. He calls the
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.200]   men of the church, older men of the church, fathers to be fathers to young men in the
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:46.360]   church. And this is part of my story. I'm losing my family, both my father to death
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:52.240]   and my mother just to be angry. What I gained in my church were brothers and
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:59.680]   sisters and fathers and mothers and they helped me along. What a gift we have in
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:05.440]   the church. Friend, are you lonely? Do you need someone to bear your burdens? Do you
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:10.800]   need someone to weep with you or to rejoice with you or to care for you? This
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:15.880]   is what God has given us in each other. If you are a member of Watermark
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.280]   Community Church, this is why we exist for one another. And if you're not a
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.760]   member of a local church, we would love to talk to you more about it. If you are a
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.840]   member of a local church and you're just visiting the porch, praise God you're
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:33.480]   here. What a gift you have in your local church. Don't, don't neglect the family
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:40.080]   that God has given you and me. And the last thing I want us to see is that
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.120]   Jesus's family gathers around and listens to him. This is what we see in
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.760]   verses 34 and 35. Notice what I read, what's the mark of someone who belongs
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:59.720]   to Jesus's family? Jesus says in verse 35, "Whoever does the will of God, he is my
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:09.000]   brother and sister and mother." Now what does that look like? Well, let me ask you
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.160]   this, what were the people around him doing? Answer, they were sitting. And where
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:23.080]   were they doing it? Literally, they were doing it around him. And what were they
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:31.600]   doing sitting around him? They were listening to him. Do you see that? These
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.560]   people were simply gathered. Jesus looks about and they're already there. They're
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.200]   gathered around him. They're sitting there listening to him, hanging around
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:47.280]   him. That's amazing to think about. "He who does the will of my father, he is my
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:55.400]   brother and my mother and my sister." What does this doing consist of? Sitting, being,
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:03.000]   hanging around, listening. It's similar to John 6 when people ask Jesus, "What
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.240]   must we be doing to be doing the works of God?" And Jesus says, "This is the work of
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:16.840]   God, that you believe in him whom he has sent." Do you get that? What do we do?
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:25.400]   Believe. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, what do we do? You believe. No, what do we do?
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:32.600]   You sit around Jesus. You hang around Jesus. You listen to Jesus through his
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:40.240]   word. Did you catch that? How do outside people get on the inside with
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:51.680]   Jesus? Not by doing, but by believing. Not by achieving, but by receiving. By banking
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:58.600]   our lives on his word and work. By receiving him. Doing the work of God is
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:05.960]   not fundamentally rooted in our work. Why? Because we are sinners and our work
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:12.400]   only brings condemnation and eternal judgment from a holy God whom we have
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:19.280]   rebelled against. But God in his mercy has made it possible for us to what? To
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:25.560]   not do, but believe. To not try to achieve and earn his favor, but to receive
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:32.560]   the one who already has. This is why God says from from heaven, "This is my beloved
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:38.600]   son. Listen to him because he has done for us what we could not do for ourselves."
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:45.760]   He obeyed in our place. He died for sin in our place. He was raised in our place.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.880]   He is seated in our place. That's why scripture can speak of us as Christians.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.360]   If you have received Christ, what happens to you? You have died with him. You've
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:58.960]   been raised to walk in newness of life. You've been seated with him in the
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:07.000]   heavenly places. And when we receive him, we receive his status, his sonship, so
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.680]   that God the Father can call us sons and daughters of God. And Jesus can call us
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:20.120]   brothers and sisters, co-heirs with him. Friends, when Jesus takes up residence in
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.880]   us, he changes our hearts. He changes our desires. He changes our wants. He changes
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:31.280]   our minds. He changes our wills so that we want to do what we ought to do. Does
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.480]   that describe you tonight? I knew as a kid what I ought to do, and I couldn't do
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:42.840]   it, and I didn't do it. But that's what describes a Christian. A Christian wants
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:49.280]   to do and can do and will do what he or she ought to do. Why? Because God makes it
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.960]   possible. He removes our hearts of stone. He gives us hearts of flesh. He writes
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:58.040]   his law on our heart. He causes us to walk in his statues. Why? Because he
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.840]   cleanses us from the inside out, and he gives us his Spirit so that we can, we
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:08.280]   want to, and we will. Doing God's will means that we hang around Jesus, listen
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:14.520]   to Jesus, gather around Jesus, and find our lives in Jesus. And let me ask you
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:23.560]   this. When Jesus looks around to see who is hanging around him, does he see you?
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:28.840]   That's a great question to know if you're on the inside, if you are part of
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:35.320]   his family. Are you hanging around him? Do you gather regularly, weekly with his
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:40.440]   church, with his body, to hear his word preached and sung and prayed and
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:46.320]   ministered? Are you hanging on his words? When you applied for that job or started
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:52.040]   that business or went on that date, did you seek counsel from him and his word?
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:57.160]   Friend, he will not lead us astray. He's a good shepherd who will always lead us
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:05.120]   to righteousness, to green pastures, to still waters. And so what's the call for
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:10.840]   us tonight? The call for us tonight is the first step in doing God's will. The
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:15.080]   first step in becoming part of his family is to come under his kingship and
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:21.760]   authority, and that is a good thing because, friends, sin is a bad king. The
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:29.520]   enemy comes to steal and to kill and to destroy, and that brings death. But King
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:35.920]   Jesus comes that he might give us life and life abundantly. So we can take Jesus
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:42.600]   at his word, we can come under his authority because he is a good king. His
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:49.120]   ways always lead to life. His ways always lead to peace and rest and assurance and
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:57.160]   love. And he provides for us what we most deeply need. Friend, what do you need
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:03.920]   from Jesus tonight? Do you need family? There's good news for you. You can find
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:09.880]   it in his church. Maybe you need deliverance. You can find it in his
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:18.880]   redemption. Do you need righteousness? You can find it in his obedience, death,
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.840]   and resurrection. Do you need forgiveness? You can find it in his
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.280]   condemnation. Do you need strength? You can find it in his power over sin, Satan,
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:31.600]   and death. Do you need sanctification? You can find it in his holiness. Do you
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.240]   need comfort? You can find it in his rest. Do you need wisdom? You can find it in
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:42.960]   him, in whom are the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And here's what happens
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.600]   when we become part of his family. When we become part of his family, we receive
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:53.840]   an assurance and a love and a freedom to go about the family business. Freedom to
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:58.960]   love our earthly families, even when it's hard. Courage to speak the truth in love,
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:03.280]   knowing that they need the same Jesus and what he can give them as you need from him
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:09.120]   too. And he's eager to give. Do you know what sends missionaries to reach the
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:13.120]   unreached with the good news of Jesus or to our neighbors or to have hard
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:17.200]   conversations with our families or to business ventures that leverage all we
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.840]   have for the sake of the gospel? Do you know what does that? It's understanding
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:27.640]   deeply that we who are not a people have become his people. That we who had not
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:34.240]   received mercy, as Hosea says, have now received mercy. Not guilt or fear that
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:39.760]   we're not doing enough, but freedom to live fully in him with the settled and
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:44.960]   joyful conviction that everything is rubbish and they're surpassing worth of
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:52.560]   following and knowing and being found in Jesus Christ our Lord. So let me finish
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:49:06.720]   by saying this. If this seems impossible for you, it is. It is. But be encouraged
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:12.360]   because Jesus is the only one who perfectly did God's will. And you know
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:20.320]   what? He did it for us and for our salvation. He did it in our place. In
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:26.880]   that great exchange where we who are sinners, we lay our sin on Jesus. And
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:32.040]   Jesus who is righteous credits us with his very righteousness. That God made him
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:36.080]   who knew no sin to be sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God in
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:41.760]   him. 2nd Corinthians 521 says. He's the only one who perfectly did God's will.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.640]   And he did it for us and for our salvation. Do you remember those
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:50.480]   precious words in the Garden of Gethsemane? He prayed, "Father, not my will
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:56.840]   but yours be done." He did God's will. He fulfilled all righteousness so that
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:05.680]   receiving him we receive everything, everything, everything we need. Even a new
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:18.480]   family. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we come to you. Then we say with Peter.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:24.520]   After you Lord Jesus looked at your disciples and said, "If you want to
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:29.000]   follow me, you gotta have all of me. You can't just follow the parts
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:35.840]   you like. You got to eat my flesh and drink my blood. The very flesh and blood
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:44.640]   that would be crucified on a cross." And Jesus tells them later on and says, "If
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:51.840]   you want my path to glory, you got to take up your cross and follow me." And he
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.880]   looks at his disciples because many of the people around him walked away. They
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:00.160]   were not hanging around him. They were not listening to him. And he looks at his
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:06.200]   disciples and says to them, "Do you wish to also go away?" And we have those
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:13.400]   precious words of Peter. "Lord, where else do we go? For you have the words of
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:22.040]   eternal life. Oh God, would we have the heart of Peter that we say to you, King
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:32.120]   Jesus, where else do we go? For you have the words of eternal life. So lead us,
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:39.240]   satisfy us, save us. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
