1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,560
 - Hi guys, my name is Harrison Ross.

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,400
 I'm the junior high director here

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,160
 at Watermark Community Church.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
 Been hanging around here for about six years.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
 So welcome Fort Worth, welcome Plano,

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,520
 welcome friends all across the country.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,600
 Excited to jump in.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,480
 Something I wanna tell you about me is I'm a new dad.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,880
 I've got, yes, yeah.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,540
 So here's my family.

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,320
 I've got a beautiful wife named Hunter

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,600
 and I've got two sweet little boys, Abel's two.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,800
 Hugh is six months.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,200
 They're amazing.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,080
 But there's something crazy that's going on in my life

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,760
 that I need to come and confess before you.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,960
 It's not church discipline,

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,480
 it's just something I need to get off my chest

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,940
 and share with you.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,580
 As a new dad, I'm now experiencing some things in life

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,000
 that for most of my life,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,400
 I made fun of every other parent for doing.

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,840
 So I've looked at friends I've had,

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,800
 at family who had babies,

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,200
 and I looked at them like they were crazy

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,680
 for some of the things that they took too seriously.

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,320
 But now, having kids, my wife and I,

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,480
 she's a new mama, I'm a new dad,

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 and we are taking crazy things way too seriously.

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,840
 Something we're taking seriously is bedtime.

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,080
 It's like a religion.

33
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,620
 And when I say we're taking it too seriously,

34
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,800
 I mean she's taking it too seriously.

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,000
 And so, guys, little advice for you gentlemen out there

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,080
 who wanna get married and maybe have kids,

37
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,000
 listen to mama.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,160
 If mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,180
 And so listen to her.

40
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,400
 My wife is an unbelievable mom.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,980
 She does an amazing job with these two kids.

42
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,480
 But we take bedtime seriously.

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,560
 I cannot believe I'm that guy.

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,720
 I'm the guy that we have to call ahead

45
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,840
 to our family or friends,

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
 oh guys, yeah, we're so excited about hanging out,

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,760
 but we're gonna have to kinda leave early.

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,920
 We're gonna have to kinda jet out, you know, the kids.

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,280
 Oh man, seriously, like, you're gonna have to leave at eight?

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,100
 That's so early.

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,240
 Oh no, no, no, I gotta leave at like 6.30 or seven

52
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,080
 to get 'em down at 7.30.

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,560
 And they're just like, you're kidding me?

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,640
 I'm that guy!

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,760
 I can't believe I'm that guy!

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,240
 No region testimony starts with,

57
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,600
 hi, my name's Harrison,

58
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,720
 and my parents just didn't take my sleep schedule

59
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,640
 serious enough.

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,500
 (audience laughing)

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,880
 When I was 18 months old, I missed a nap,

62
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,440
 and it was downhill from there.

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,280
 (audience laughing)

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,660
 It doesn't happen that way!

65
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,280
 But yet it's what my wife and I are consumed by,

66
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,680
 and it's not gonna change their life,

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,240
 it's changing our life when we're sleeping.

68
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,720
 But that's the season we're in,

69
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,240
 and we're taking crazy things too seriously.

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,440
 They're gonna grow up,

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,120
 and we're gonna take their magazine drive too seriously.

72
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,940
 We're gonna take the PTSA, whatever it is, too seriously.

73
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,480
 We all have things in our lives

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,600
 that in different seasons we take too seriously.

75
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,940
 Sports teams, football's coming up.

76
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,240
 Who's excited for football?

77
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
 (audience cheering)

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,180
 You bet you are.

79
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,120
 Maybe some of you guys are already putting together

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,760
 your fantasy football league,

81
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,360
 you're trying to get the draft.

82
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,960
 I got two friends in community who live in Dallas,

83
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,780
 are flying to Georgia to pick their fantasy football team.

84
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,660
 You're taking it too seriously, guys.

85
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,000
 You're leaving your family for nothing.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,440
 Fantasy football is huge in our culture.

87
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,800
 Maybe it's your dating life.

88
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,920
 Maybe it's your hypothetical dating life.

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,400
 (audience laughing)

90
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,400
 Your Instagram likes, the perfect caption, CrossFit.

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,960
 Oh, I gotta make sure I post my WOD,

92
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,720
 and how awesome I did with the best time, blah!

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,880
 (audience laughing)

94
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,800
 You're taking it too seriously, nobody cares,

95
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,760
 and we all have these things

96
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,300
 that we take way too seriously,

97
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,980
 and we take way too seriously most of the times

98
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,940
 the things that don't matter,

99
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,620
 but there are things in life that we should take seriously.

100
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,620
 One that I wanna talk about specifically tonight.

101
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,580
 We don't take it serious enough.

102
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,060
 We kinda get consumed by all these other things,

103
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,100
 but the one thing that we should take seriously are faith.

104
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,760
 We believe some lies and bad advice,

105
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,460
 and don't take it serious.

106
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,960
 We're in this series called Bad Advice,

107
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,320
 and the bad advice that we're gonna tackle tonight is,

108
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,360
 man, don't take your faith too seriously.

109
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,220
 I mean, come on, you don't wanna be that crazy Christian.

110
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,080
 You don't wanna be that weirdo at the office,

111
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,560
 the guy who's always just kinda yapping about Jesus,

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,800
 and got that Greek tattoo on the bicep

113
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,400
 that kinda peeks out under your shirt.

114
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,100
 Man, don't take your faith too seriously.

115
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,500
 Lighten up, live a little.

116
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,580
 We're in our 20s and 30s, we're young adults, let's go.

117
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,700
 Tonight we're gonna look at a passage in Revelation

118
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,020
 where Jesus speaks directly to the church,

119
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,740
 and he's gonna tackle this bad advice

120
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,120
 of don't take your faith too seriously.

121
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,120
 He's gonna call us to take our faith too seriously.

122
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,460
 What we're gonna look at is Jesus casts out those

123
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,700
 who don't take their faith too seriously.

124
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,300
 Jesus calls us to seriously value

125
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,260
 where true treasure is found,

126
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,600
 and then Jesus seriously loves you.

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,260
 If you got your Bible, let's open up to Revelation 3.

128
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,400
 We're gonna be in a passage here

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,820
 that Jesus has been speaking to different churches.

130
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,540
 There are a series of seven churches

131
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,240
 that he is giving a message to.

132
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,700
 This is the last of these seven churches.

133
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,860
 It's a church in Laodicea,

134
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,420
 and Jesus is talking through this whole passage.

135
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,720
 So starting in verse 14, here's what we say.

136
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,380
 And the angel of the church in Laodicea

137
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,380
 write the words of the amen, the faithful and true witness,

138
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,660
 the beginning of God's creation.

139
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,380
 I know your works.

140
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,260
 You're neither cold nor hot,

141
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,200
 whither you either cold or hot.

142
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,660
 So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold,

143
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,700
 I will spit you out of my mouth.

144
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
 Here's the first point.

145
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,900
 Jesus casts out those

146
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
 who don't take their faith too seriously.

147
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,700
 Did you see what we just read?

148
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,380
 Did you just really say that?

149
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,740
 He's talking about hot and cold,

150
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,460
 and okay, maybe there's different parts of our faith

151
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,580
 or our life that are that way,

152
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,660
 but then he amps it up a little bit,

153
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,060
 and he says, "If you are lukewarm,

154
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,420
 "I'm gonna spit you out of my mouth."

155
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,560
 And what he's talking about here is cultural Christianity,

156
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,460
 and we're all guilty of it at some point.

157
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,300
 Cultural Christianity, he calls it lukewarm Christianity.

158
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,380
 A lukewarm Christian is somebody who lives their life

159
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,940
 in compartments, in boxes.

160
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,260
 This is maybe what a lukewarm Christian looks like,

161
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,220
 somebody who's got all of these things segmented out.

162
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,540
 It sounds like a good way to live,

163
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,820
 to think wisely about all these areas

164
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,220
 and make sure that you've got your ducks in a row,

165
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,180
 you've got your career, your friends, you wanna have fun,

166
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,340
 you've got your dating life, your resume, your family,

167
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,500
 your healthy lifestyle.

168
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,580
 I mean, Jesus is in there.

169
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,020
 He's in the top.

170
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,840
 He's on that top row, so he's important,

171
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,820
 but I don't wanna take my faith too seriously

172
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,260
 and let Jesus kinda get in some of my other areas of life.

173
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,900
 I mean, I don't want Jesus to mess up my fun.

174
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,500
 It's a little too much.

175
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,340
 I wanna have fun.

176
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,540
 [laughs]

177
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,900
 How do you feel with Jesus?

178
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,980
 And so we section it out and we make sure

179
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,580
 that things are perfect and then we start making excuses.

180
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,840
 Okay, well, career, my career, my job,

181
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,480
 it's just taking a lot right now.

182
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,500
 We had somebody who quit at work

183
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,660
 and so I'm having to take on a heavier workload.

184
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,260
 I gotta, I'll push Jesus off a little bit.

185
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,060
 Maybe when I get a family, once I'm married,

186
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,540
 maybe once I hit my 30s, my 40s,

187
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,780
 someday I'll take my faith seriously

188
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,780
 and we live with Jesus compartmentalized

189
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,180
 as a part of our life.

190
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:21,320
 Jesus is calling out lukewarm cultural Christianity

191
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,700
 and he says, hey, what you should be as a believer,

192
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,580
 as a Christ follower, somebody who is submitted

193
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,700
 and surrendered to Jesus, somebody who doesn't just have

194
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,340
 Jesus as a part of their life, but Jesus is your life.

195
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,260
 Jesus is the compartment.

196
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,820
 Jesus is the lens through which you look through everything.

197
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,700
 It's not several boxes, it's one box

198
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,660
 where you are identified by Jesus Christ

199
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,060
 and every aspect of your life is surrendered

200
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,620
 and submitted to that and fits inside that.

201
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,700
 That's what being a believer is.

202
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,500
 How you work, how you date, how you have fun,

203
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,460
 what career that you will do, your family,

204
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,520
 how you will steward your body, all of that.

205
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,640
 Has been given over to Jesus because he gave himself

206
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,480
 for you.

207
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,680
 Anything outside of that is just an excuse

208
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,960
 and it's lukewarm.

209
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,520
 We all do it, I do it.

210
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,560
 Jesus says, if you are lukewarm,

211
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,320
 I'm gonna spit you out of my mouth.

212
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,760
 He continues, he goes on.

213
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,160
 We see in verse 17, Jesus says,

214
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,940
 for you say I'm rich, I've prospered, I need nothing.

215
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,080
 Not realizing that you're wretched, pitiable,

216
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,880
 poor, blind, and naked, I counsel you to buy from me gold

217
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
 refined by fire so that you may be rich,

218
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,240
 white garments so that you may clothe yourself

219
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,120
 and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen

220
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,360
 and salve to anoint your eyes that you may see.

221
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,880
 Those whom I love I reprove and discipline

222
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,480
 so be zealous and repent.

223
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,320
 The second thing we see is that Jesus calls us

224
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,620
 to take seriously the treasure.

225
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,600
 This church in Laodicea, they're a wealthy city.

226
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,640
 Historically, we know that they have a lot of money.

227
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,200
 So right at the beginning, that verse 17,

228
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,000
 we see him basically just go, man guys, you are wealthy.

229
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,520
 You got cars, you got anything you could ever ask for

230
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,980
 and you are poor.

231
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,240
 You're poor.

232
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,920
 Can you imagine going to a wealthy neighborhood?

233
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,080
 I mean, we're talking super wealthy neighborhood.

234
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,800
 Like mansions, you ever driven through

235
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,620
 one of these neighborhoods?

236
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,440
 Can you imagine if I go into one of those mansions

237
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
 and I just, I'm gawking and I'm looking around

238
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,760
 and it's all marble and there's butlers everywhere

239
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,880
 and I just, I shake the hand of the guy who owns it

240
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,280
 and I said, man, I feel so sorry for you.

241
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,900
 You're dirt poor.

242
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,620
 Can you imagine the look on his face?

243
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,160
 This is what Jesus is saying.

244
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,200
 All these things you find life in, all this stuff,

245
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,680
 all this stuff that you try to find identity in

246
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 and value from, the things that you treasure,

247
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,960
 it's worthless.

248
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,480
 It is nothing.

249
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,080
 It is of no value spiritually.

250
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,100
 You're poor if you're trying to find life

251
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,880
 and identity in that.

252
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,440
 So I'm a junior high pastor.

253
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,240
 I hang with junior high kids a lot.

254
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,480
 And hanging with junior high kids,

255
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,360
 you see very quickly that they are trying to find identity.

256
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,840
 They're quickly clinging on to whatever's new

257
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,560
 and whatever's next.

258
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,240
 And so you see that they're really into the shoe game.

259
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,340
 I mean, that's the thing right now.

260
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,560
 They're like, oh man, my kicks are sweeter than your kicks.

261
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,020
 Yeah, that's what's up.

262
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,000
 No, I got these, you can't have these.

263
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 You're gonna grow out of them in four months.

264
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,900
 Get over it.

265
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,800
 You might buy 'em from 'em if they're a big kid

266
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,780
 and they hit puberty earlier.

267
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,640
 So the shoe game is big.

268
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,380
 And then it's what people think of me, what I wear,

269
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,600
 my athletic success, my academic success.

270
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,900
 And it's easy to see in junior high

271
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,540
 and you just go, hey guys, hey, that's not gonna last.

272
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,700
 Doesn't matter.

273
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,780
 But I see that I do it in my own life.

274
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,860
 There are things that I thought were so valuable

275
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,880
 that I was so into that I was consumed by.

276
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,220
 Pogs, anybody know pogs?

277
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,760
 If you don't know pogs, look it up.

278
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,100
 They're cheap right now.

279
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,380
 Pogs are these little paper circles.

280
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,620
 You'd stack 'em up and you'd get this sweet slammer

281
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,580
 that had like finger imprints so that you could get

282
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,180
 extra like leverage and boom, and you flip 'em over.

283
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,360
 It doesn't matter.

284
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,220
 I was obsessed with 'em.

285
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,740
 They're awesome.

286
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,780
 I'd go to the store, I'd save my money and be like,

287
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,340
 ah, special edition.

288
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,380
 Nerd.

289
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,100
 Like who cares?

290
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,060
 I went to a tournament for pogs.

291
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,780
 I brought my whole collection.

292
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,460
 And I was like, all right, I'll battle you.

293
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,660
 (imitates punching)

294
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,100
 You took mine, ah.

295
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,940
 It doesn't matter.

296
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,820
 Then I was really into, in junior high, a dino bike.

297
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,620
 Anybody have a dino bike?

298
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,740
 BMX bike?

299
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,620
 Just me.

300
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,900
 I thought it was awesome.

301
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,660
 (audience laughing)

302
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,680
 Ah, I used to like pray for this bike.

303
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,500
 Seriously, I'd go, Lord, if you love me, give me this bike.

304
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
 I'd open the door, no bike.

305
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,820
 Really badly affected my theology.

306
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,580
 I loved this dino bike.

307
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,380
 As I grew into high school, then I became really consumed

308
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,980
 about what people thought of me.

309
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,180
 I knew what I thought about myself.

310
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,380
 And so I would be the guy that would be funny

311
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,020
 or I would try to make them think that I didn't care

312
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,060
 because I didn't want them to know who I was.

313
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,420
 I knew everybody, but I was friends with no one.

314
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,620
 College, I was really into my hair.

315
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,420
 I just was.

316
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,500
 I had to flip like the, ah.

317
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,740
 (audience laughing)

318
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,140
 I had somebody recognize me in New York City

319
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,140
 from like an intersection over and go, that's Harrison.

320
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,180
 Are you serious?

321
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,380
 Because of the flip.

322
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,620
 I was into my hair.

323
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,420
 I was really into converting my basement

324
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,660
 into a recording studio.

325
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,620
 Why?

326
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,980
 It was this nasty basement.

327
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
 I spent two all-nighters trying to do it

328
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,100
 and it all peeled off the wall.

329
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,100
 I became a young adult and I got so consumed with my job

330
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,340
 and how I could establish myself in my career

331
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,460
 and how I could be a leader and I was consumed by that.

332
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,300
 And today, what I'm wrestling with

333
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,700
 is just the approval of man.

334
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,300
 What people think of me, where I think that I'm valued,

335
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,480
 where I am worth something.

336
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,900
 And guys, we all do it.

337
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,020
 It's easy to look back in junior high,

338
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,420
 that stupid, silly stuff, but we all have it in our life now

339
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,380
 that we see as the ultimate, that we want to be ultimate,

340
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,640
 that Shane talked about, the shiny thing that we're chasing,

341
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,640
 that job, that husband, that wife, that thing, that feeling,

342
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,220
 and we think it's gonna satisfy and it's not gonna satisfy.

343
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,380
 Jesus says, "I'm the treasure."

344
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,400
 Jesus says, "Those things are worthless.

345
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,700
 "If you spend your life chasing them, you will be poor."

346
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,140
 You're chasing gold, it's fool's gold.

347
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,500
 It looks like the same thing.

348
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,960
 It is worth nothing.

349
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,460
 Everything that we're trying to find identity in

350
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,740
 and value in, it is worthless compared to Jesus.

351
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,940
 He's the true treasure.

352
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,280
 (congregation laughing)

353
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,720
 What's really cool is we're about to see

354
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,920
 what Jesus thinks of us.

355
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,940
 Not just that he is amazing and awesome,

356
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,180
 but what he thinks of us, and it might be different

357
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,480
 than what you think he thinks of you.

358
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,260
 The letter continues, and Jesus says,

359
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,140
 "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.

360
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,540
 "If anyone hears my voice and opens the door,

361
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,320
 "I will come into him and eat with him and he with me.

362
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,880
 "The one who conquers, I will grant him

363
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,220
 "to sit with me on the throne.

364
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,640
 "And as I also conquered and sat down

365
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,580
 "with my Father on his throne,

366
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,860
 "he who has an ear, let him hear

367
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,900
 "what the Spirit says to the churches."

368
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,700
 The final point we're gonna look at tonight

369
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,580
 is that Jesus seriously loves you.

370
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,180
 Do you believe that?

371
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,440
 Do I believe that?

372
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,340
 Sitting here tonight, that Jesus loves me?

373
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,260
 I could sing it as a kid.

374
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,560
 Jesus loves me, this I know,

375
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,820
 for the Bible tells me so, do I believe that?

376
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,960
 Jesus loves you, and he wants relationship with you.

377
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,740
 Not because he needs you.

378
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,680
 Not because he needs to be satisfied by relationship

379
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,100
 with as many people as he can have.

380
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,460
 He is the treasure, and he wants to share

381
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,420
 his abundance of wealth with you.

382
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,020
 He wants to give you the kingdom.

383
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,300
 He wants to give you it all because he loves you.

384
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,260
 He wants to be in relationship with you.

385
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,940
 In relationship, it takes time.

386
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,300
 It takes investment, and he's taking the initiative.

387
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,780
 He already has, and he continues to.

388
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,700
 That's a relationship worth investing in.

389
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,240
 You think of other relationships that are super important.

390
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,060
 Maybe a marriage, my wife would say that's important.

391
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,620
 Can you imagine if someone said to you,

392
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,960
 my community group, if they're like,

393
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,740
 "Hey, Harrison, yeah, man, thanks for sharing.

394
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,620
 "Hey, don't take your marriage too seriously.

395
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,640
 "Excuse me?

396
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,860
 "Don't take your marriage too seriously.

397
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,980
 "My wife's gonna come poppin' out.

398
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,300
 "Oh, man, you better take your marriage seriously."

399
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,540
 She's very loving, I promise.

400
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,340
 And so, that's bad advice.

401
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,060
 I had a friend who got engaged this last Saturday.

402
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,180
 Oh my goodness, such a beautiful ring.

403
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,220
 Oh, that finally happened.

404
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,100
 Some advice, don't take this engagement thing too seriously.

405
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,860
 I mean, you got a ring, but make sure you date around.

406
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,260
 Make sure it's right.

407
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,100
 That's bad advice.

408
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,340
 Relationships that really matter, we should take seriously.

409
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,460
 But our culture believes,

410
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,500
 man, don't take your faith too seriously.

411
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,420
 Maybe do the Jesus thing when it's convenient,

412
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,660
 but then don't be sold out.

413
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,500
 That's crazy.

414
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,540
 What we see in the text is Jesus is knockin'.

415
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,780
 He's standin' at the door.

416
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,660
 And he knocks because he loves you.

417
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,500
 We've all been there.

418
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
 You're in your apartment, in your house,

419
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,540
 you're hangin' with your roommates,

420
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,060
 you're just playin' FIFA for like eight hours.

421
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,300
 Or maybe you're Netflixing,

422
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,420
 you're playin' this game that you've made up

423
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,700
 and only you and your roommates know the rules.

424
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,460
 And you're just like throwin' things off the wall

425
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,860
 and you hear this knock on the door.

426
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,060
 (knocking)

427
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,300
 They have to knock a couple times.

428
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,100
 Someone finally gets up, you go over,

429
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,740
 you look at the door, you see who's there.

430
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,420
 Shh, hey, hey, hey, hey, pretend we're not here.

431
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,260
 What, what?

432
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,660
 Turn it off, turn it off, pretend we're not here.

433
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
 Who is it?

434
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,900
 I don't know.

435
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,100
 But they got a clipboard, it can't be good.

436
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,620
 So maybe it's the Time Warner guy.

437
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,020
 Maybe it's your landlord or the apartment manager.

438
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,540
 Maybe it's some kid tryin' to sell

439
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,620
 wrapping paper or magazines.

440
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,780
 The kids are the worst.

441
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,460
 You always get suckered.

442
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,660
 I'm sendin' my kids to you, all of you.

443
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,580
 And so whoever it is, it's Girl Scout Cookies,

444
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,220
 you're just like hey, pretend we're not here

445
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,060
 because we don't wanna mess with it.

446
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,500
 Guys, Jesus is knockin'.

447
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,340
 He just sits at the door and he's knockin'.

448
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,860
 Maybe if he had Girl Scout Cookies, we'd let him in.

449
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
 (congregation laughing)

450
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,180
 But he's just sittin' there.

451
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,180
 Behold, I stand at the door and I knock.

452
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,420
 It's Jesus.

453
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,540
 He's knocking because he loves you.

454
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,780
 He's not your landlord.

455
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,380
 He's not just tryin' to come and tell you

456
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,020
 where you've missed your rent for three months

457
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,820
 or all these noise complaints from neighbors

458
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,900
 or these things that you should be evicted for.

459
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,740
 He is not this guy that's just gonna come in

460
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,020
 and wanna punch you in the face.

461
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,260
 He's knocking continually because he loves you.

462
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,140
 He wants relationship with you.

463
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,380
 He cares for you and values you.

464
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,020
 He treasures you.

465
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,580
 He seriously loves you.

466
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,700
 Why wouldn't we take that seriously?

467
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,020
 (congregation laughing)

468
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,900
 And so, in summary, what we've seen from this passage

469
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,660
 is that Jesus casts out those

470
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,960
 who don't take their faith seriously.

471
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,260
 Jesus calls us to take seriously the true treasure.

472
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,660
 The true treasure, it's him, it's Jesus.

473
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,180
 And then the craziest truth,

474
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,780
 that Jesus seriously loves you

475
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,060
 and sees you as the treasure.

476
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,660
 Guys, he's knocking.

477
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,900
 (knocking)

478
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,980
 And maybe you're like me,

479
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,080
 who just kinda wrestles with stuff

480
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,440
 and you hear that knock and you know it's Jesus

481
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,840
 and you just start to kinda look around

482
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,180
 and you're like, oh my goodness, now?

483
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,980
 I mean, but I got stuff everywhere.

484
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,340
 It's scattered, it's messy.

485
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,860
 Like, is he gonna come in and see all the junk in my life?

486
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,220
 I don't want him to come in now.

487
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,940
 He's gonna think I'm not a good Christian,

488
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,780
 I don't have it together.

489
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,660
 Let me clean this up.

490
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,940
 Hold on, let me clean this up.

491
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,860
 Let me get it together.

492
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,680
 Hold on, Jesus!

493
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,360
 He's just knocking.

495
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,500
 (knocking)

496
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,220
 Maybe you do think he's like a landlord.

497
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,500
 You think he's gonna come barging in.

498
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,940
 He's gonna be like, hey, hey!

499
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,160
 Jesus is not just gonna push his way through the door.

500
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,420
 Maybe you hear that knock and you're overcome with shame.

501
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,860
 Overcome with guilt.

502
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,380
 Overcome because you think, man,

503
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,820
 I'm not worthy enough for that guy to come in my life.

504
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,740
 That was me.

505
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,420
 So maybe you're out here and you're like, me?

506
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,660
 I became a believer.

507
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,620
 I trusted my life in Christ when I was eight years old.

508
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,060
 But I was addicted to porn for 12 years.

509
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:58,060
 And on the outside, I was this good Christian kid.

510
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,300
 I was the kid who knew everybody.

511
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,860
 I was the kid who loved life and had a ton of fun

512
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,580
 and I was dying inside.

513
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,100
 I didn't want anybody to know.

514
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,860
 I didn't think anybody would love me.

515
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,140
 I didn't love myself.

516
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,600
 How could Jesus love me?

517
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:20,180
 And so I just gave in to what I thought the world treasured,

518
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,720
 where I thought I had value and how the world saw me.

519
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,360
 And Jesus didn't run away.

520
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,060
 Jesus is still there.

521
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,740
 He's knocking.

522
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,900
 Because he loves you.

523
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,780
 Because he's gonna relentlessly pursue you.

524
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,540
 Because he's crazy about you.

525
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,940
 He adores you.

526
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,380
 He treasures you.

527
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,860
 He values you.

528
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,580
 And he wants to give away everything that he's got to you,

529
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,820
 his child.

530
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,700
 We believe the lie.

531
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,300
 Don't take your faith too seriously.

532
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,500
 I hope that you do.

533
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,000
 And get out of trying to just go through the motions

534
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,180
 of cultural Christianity,

535
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,680
 but as a Christian, go out and change the culture.

536
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,640
 'Cause it's with Jesus.

537
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,580
 He's knocking and he wants to come in,

538
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,380
 not to just tidy everything up

539
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,620
 so that he's not embarrassed by you,

540
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,340
 not to make sure that we fix your life

541
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,240
 so that it's Christian perfect,

542
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,460
 but he wants to come in and eat with you,

543
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,220
 fellowship with you, laugh with you,

544
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,700
 be with you, live life with you,

545
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,700
 allow your life to be consumed with him

546
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,380
 so that it's full of joy,

547
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,820
 so that it is fulfilled,

548
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,180
 so that others find life from you

549
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,900
 because his life is in you.

550
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,840
 That Jesus loves you.

551
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,740
 I pray that we will live in a way

552
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,820
 showing that we love him.

553
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,660
 Let me pray.

554
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,260
 Heavenly Father, thank you that you love us.

555
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,940
 Thank you that you've loved us so much

556
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,260
 that you sent your son, Jesus,

557
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,860
 to dwell with us,

558
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,780
 to come and live with us

559
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,620
 and set us free from sin and death

560
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,860
 by dying on the cross,

561
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,440
 raising to new life

562
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,980
 so that we could be reconciled to a living God,

563
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,020
 that we could be renewed with you,

564
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,400
 that we could have life in you

565
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,460
 instead of trying to seek the fleeting pleasures

566
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,740
 of this world, the stuff that is worthless,

567
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,260
 the stuff that we think is gonna identify us

568
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,540
 and find life but is worthless.

569
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,460
 Lord, will you give us the courage

570
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,820
 and boldness to trust you?

571
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,100
 I pray for people who are here tonight.

572
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,140
 They hear you knocking for the first time

573
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,980
 after around several times,

574
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,980
 and Lord, I just pray they'd open the door

575
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,660
 and allow you in.

576
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,060
 They'd open up to a friend around them

577
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,620
 and allow what is happening in their heart,

578
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,380
 the hurt, the pain,

579
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,180
 allow others into their life

580
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,840
 so that we can walk in freedom.

581
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,500
 Lord, help us not believe the lie,

582
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,060
 that we're gonna be crazy if we do it.

583
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,780
 Help us be crazy passionate for you

584
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,580
 so that our lives will be changed

585
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,380
 and that this world will be transformed.

586
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,220
 We love you.

587
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,020
 Thank you that you first loved us.

588
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,080
 It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

589
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,360
 Come in and eat with you,

590
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,760
 fellowship with you,

591
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,120
 laugh with you,

592
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,160
 be with you,

593
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,600
 live life with you.

594
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,560
 Allow your life to be consumed with him

595
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,240
 so that it's full of joy,

596
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,680
 so that it is fulfilled,

597
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,040
 so that others find life from you

598
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,800
 because his life is in you.

599
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,720
 That Jesus loves you.

600
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,640
 I pray that we will live in a way

601
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,840
 showing that we love him.

602
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,600
 Let me pray.

603
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,160
 Heavenly Father, thank you that you love us.

604
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,840
 Thank you that you've loved us so much

605
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,180
 that you sent your son, Jesus,

606
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,800
 to dwell with us,

607
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,720
 to come and live with us

608
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,520
 and set us free from sin and death

609
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,760
 by dying on the cross,

610
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,360
 raising to new life

611
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,900
 so that we could be reconciled to a living God,

612
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,960
 that we could be renewed with you,

613
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,320
 that we could have life in you

614
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,960
 instead of trying to seek

615
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,020
 the fleeting pleasures of this world,

616
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,640
 the stuff that is worthless,

617
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,160
 the stuff that we think is gonna identify us

618
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,440
 and find life but is worthless.

619
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,380
 Lord, will you give us the courage

620
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,740
 and boldness to trust you.

621
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,880
 I pray for people who are here tonight.

622
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,080

624
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,880
 And Lord, I just pray they'd open the door

625
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,580
 and allow you in.

626
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,960
 They'd open up to a friend around them

630
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,740
 so that we can walk in freedom.

631
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,400

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,960
 that we're gonna be crazy if we do it.

633
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,700
 Help us be crazy passionate for you
