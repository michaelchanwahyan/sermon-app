 [MUSIC PLAYING]

4
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,720
 Welcome, friends in the room.

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,980
 Welcome, friends in Fort Worth.

6
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,660
 We're going to start in a unusual way.

7
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,820
 I need everyone to stand up.

8
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,900
 Everyone to stand up.

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,340
 We're going to play a little game.

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,140
 We're going to play a little game.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,900
 Yeah, there you go.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,540
 Get excited.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,380
 Stand it up.

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,300
 Get some energy out.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,140
 Jumping jacks.

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,940
 OK.

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,140
 We're going to play a game called Simon Says Fort Worth.

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,100
 I'm talking to you two.

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,180
 Everyone stands up in the room.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,300
 I need everyone to play.

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,420
 You can't be too pretentious, speaking particularly

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,700
 to my friends in Dallas here.

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,060
 It's a struggle of ours.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,020
 Everyone's going to play.

25
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,780
 Simon says.

26
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,860
 There may be a prize involved.

27
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,340
 We already gave away an Apple Watch.

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,500
 Who knows what else we got?

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,460
 A new car.

30
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,180
 So here we go.

31
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,740
 Everyone's involved.

32
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,060
 And if you see someone who doesn't follow along,

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,180
 you got to point them out.

34
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,780
 Citizen's arrest may get happen.

35
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,660
 Tell them to sit down.

36
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,220
 Here we go.

37
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,260
 Simon says right hand up.

38
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,900
 Simon says left hand up.

39
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,220
 Right hand down.

40
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,620
 Oh, there we go.

41
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,500
 You're sitting down.

42
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,300
 Sit down.

43
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,220
 Sit down.

44
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,740
 Sit down.

45
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,460
 I think I see some people who didn't.

46
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,380
 All right, here we go.

47
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,420
 All right, here we go.

48
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,980
 Right hand down.

49
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,780
 Oh, man.

50
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,780
 It's so terrible.

51
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,620
 All right, Simon says clap once.

52
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,340
 Simon says clap twice.

53
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,140
 Clap once.

54
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,700
 I love it.

55
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,460
 Man, this is really getting people going.

56
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,460
 Here we go.

57
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,580
 All right, here we go.

58
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,220
 Simon says both hands down.

59
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,980
 Left hand up.

60
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,500
 Simon says right hand up.

61
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,860
 Simon says right hand down.

62
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,980
 Simon says right hand up.

63
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,620
 Clap once.

64
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,620
 Simon says clap once.

65
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,500
 Simon says clap twice.

66
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,820
 Both hands down.

67
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,620
 There we go.

68
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,740
 Man, we are just steady.

69
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,700
 Simon says both hands up.

70
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,140
 Right hand down.

71
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,820
 Man, it just works every time.

72
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,780
 All right, Simon says both hands up.

73
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,060
 Simon says both hands down.

74
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,220
 Simon says both hands up.

75
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,300
 Simon says both hands down.

76
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,420
 Simon says left hand up.

77
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,820
 Simon says both hands up.

78
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,340
 Somebody needs to sit up there.

79
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,300
 I see you in the back.

80
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,340
 I see you in Fort Worth, too.

81
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,780
 Yeah, uh-huh.

82
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,100
 Yeah, you in the back.

83
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,860
 All right, both hands down.

84
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,500
 No, man.

85
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
 Golly.

86
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,940
 Simon says clap once.

87
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,420
 Simon says clap twice.

88
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,180
 Clap twice.

89
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,780
 Simon says both hands down.

90
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,500
 Right hand up.

91
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,260
 Simon says both hands up.

92
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,660
 Simon says both hands down.

93
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,500
 Simon says sit down.

94
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,380
 Simon says stand back up.

95
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,780
 Sit back down.

96
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,140
 Simon says both hands up.

97
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,340
 Left hand down.

98
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,300
 All right, here we go.

99
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,780
 Stop right there.

100
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,500
 Y'all stay standing.

101
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,020
 Stop right there.

102
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,620
 Stay standing.

103
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,900
 Stay standing.

104
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,100
 The reason we start with that game is-- let me tell you this.

105
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,060
 So let me ask you this.

106
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,260
 What would you say if I said only those people in the room

107
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,460
 and in Fort Worth who are right now standing get into heaven?

108
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:14,960
 Woo!

109
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,260
 [LAUGHTER]

110
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,620
 [APPLAUSE]

111
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,980
 It's not actually true.

112
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,260
 All right, it is true.

113
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,940
 OK.

114
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,740
 All right, you guys sit back down.

115
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,900
 Only those people who followed the rules Simon says sit down.

116
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,620
 I love it.

117
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,180
 Man, we got rule followers.

118
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,740
 I love it.

119
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,060
 We got some firstborns in this room.

120
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,260
 In other words, what would you say if I said only

121
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,980
 the people who perfectly followed Simon's rules

122
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,780
 or the rules got into heaven?

123
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,220
 What would you say, furthermore, if Jesus said that?

124
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,820
 Because tonight, we're going through this series

125
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,580
 all summer long called Summer on the Mount,

126
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,300
 where we're diving into Jesus's most famous sermon of all time.

127
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,700
 Arguably the most famous sermon of all time,

128
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,500
 the Sermon on the Mount.

129
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,260
 And tonight, the interpretive challenge

130
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,500
 from the text we're going to look at in Matthew chapter 5.

131
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,540
 If you have a Bible, you can flip there right now.

132
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,460
 It'll be up on the screens.

133
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,860
 If you don't have one, no problem.

134
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:25,780
 But the interpretive challenge for tonight is Jesus says that.

135
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,580
 So what could he possibly mean?

136
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,780
 So tonight, we're going to really explore

137
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,020
 the subject of what does heaven require?

138
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,780
 Because he says one of the most shocking,

139
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,940
 if not the most shocking statements

140
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,980
 in his entire ministry in the verses

141
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,020
 that we're about to read.

142
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,900
 We're going to pick it up in verse 17.

143
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,700
 We're going to explore really what this relationship--

144
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,180
 heaven, how we can get to heaven,

145
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,900
 and how that relates to the law, which is

146
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,740
 what Jesus is about to address.

147
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,780
 And by law, I mean the Old Testament, the Old Covenant,

148
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,180
 the first half of your Bible, if you have one.

149
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,540
 We're going to explore how does Jesus fulfill the law?

150
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,820
 What role does the law play for us today?

151
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,660
 On this side of Jesus, what role does the law play for us today?

152
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,900
 Is it still relevant?

153
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,940
 And why do we abide by certain parts and not other ones?

154
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,460
 Why is it OK to eat shellfish, but homosexuality is not OK?

155
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,900
 What role does the law play for us today?

156
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,860
 And then really, how can we keep the law?

157
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,260
 So I'm just going to set the scene.

158
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,220
 We talked about it last week.

159
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,640
 If you weren't here, I'd encourage

160
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,860
 you to go to the Porch app.

161
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,940
 And you can listen to that message.

162
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,540
 You can be totally caught up on where we are in this series.

163
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,660
 But here's what's going on.

164
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,420
 So Jesus, early in his ministry, he's done some miracles.

165
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,620
 Things are going well.

166
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,860
 His popularity is continuing to take off,

167
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,980
 because when you can do miracles, that happens.

168
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,220
 And he goes up on this mountainside.

169
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,980
 And this crowd gathers around him.

170
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,340
 And Jesus says, I'm going to take this opportunity

171
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,540
 to teach them.

172
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,220
 And he begins to lay out these radical teachings

173
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,500
 that those in the audience who were there that day

174
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,340
 would go on to change the world.

175
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,980
 And so this summer, we're exploring

176
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,900
 what some of those radical teachings were.

177
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,060
 We're going to pick up in verse 17,

178
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,780
 where Jesus begins the discussion around the law.

179
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,380
 Here's what he says.

180
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,720
 Do not think, Jesus speaking, that I have come to abolish

181
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,700
 the law or the prophets.

182
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,540
 So what is the law?

183
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,380
 The prophets, the prophets.

184
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,120
 And the law is the Old Testament,

185
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,420
 would be what his audience would have heard.

186
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,140
 I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.

187
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,900
 That Jesus says, let me get this out of the way,

188
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,700
 right up front, I did not come to do away with the law.

189
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,980
 I'm not saying, hey, the law, I was just kidding.

190
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,580
 You know, you guys are crazy.

191
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,940
 We're just going to do away with that.

192
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,280
 That's not what I'm here to do at all.

193
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,940
 I have come to fulfill it.

194
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,420
 Now, when you and I think law,

195
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,660
 we think something different than the original

196
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,900
 ancient Jewish audience that he's talking to.

197
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,060
 When you and I think law, we think taxes you need to pay

198
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,400
 or a speeding ticket and kind of a long arm police

199
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,240
 of the law.

200
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,940
 The audience in this case, or in this context,

201
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,820
 heard something very different.

202
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,640
 Law really involved every part of their life.

203
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,420
 In other words, they didn't just hear law,

204
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,180
 okay, that means I can't ride my camel

205
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,740
 in a school zone too fast.

206
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,840
 They heard the term that was identified

207
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,020
 with every aspect of their life.

208
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,660
 The law informed everything that they could do,

209
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,700
 everything that they couldn't do.

210
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,220
 The law told them what they could eat.

211
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,600
 The law told them how to maintain,

212
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,460
 experience relationship with God.

213
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,460
 It told them when they could do things,

214
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,020
 when they could not do certain things.

215
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,180
 The law was huge.

216
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,540
 It was what set the nation apart.

217
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,580
 The law was not king, but it was close.

218
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,260
 And so they're hearing Jesus say,

219
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,980
 hey, I haven't showed up on the scene

220
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,500
 to do away with all those Old Testament rules and laws.

221
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,340
 I've come to fulfill them.

222
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,900
 Now, what does he mean by fulfill?

223
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,180
 The word fulfill is the same word

224
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,140
 for to fill in what is lacking.

225
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,020
 You can probably imagine.

226
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,440
 What Jesus says is I didn't come to get rid of it.

227
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,820
 I came to fill in what is lacking.

228
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,860
 And there's three ways.

229
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,820
 We're gonna move kind of quick through this.

230
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,780
 There's three ways Jesus really fulfills

231
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,660
 what is lacking inside of the law.

232
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,500
 When it comes to the Old Testament rules

233
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,820
 and how they were supposed to live,

234
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,300
 Jesus says I didn't come to do away.

235
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,220
 I came to fulfill them.

236
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,120
 And the first way he does that is by giving clarity

237
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,660
 to what they always were intended to mean.

238
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,260
 Or raising the standard would be another way.

239
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,740
 It seemed like he was raising the standard,

240
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,740
 but he just gives clarity to what the rules

241
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,700
 and laws he was giving.

242
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,500
 That's the first way Jesus fulfills the law.

243
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,100
 In other words, throughout this whole sermon

244
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,940
 for the rest of the summer,

245
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,900
 we're gonna explore how Jesus over and over says this.

246
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,980
 You've heard it said, but I tell you.

247
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,620
 You've heard it said you shall not murder,

248
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,460
 but I tell you if you're angry,

249
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,380
 you've committed the same sin.

250
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,300
 You've heard it said that you shouldn't commit adultery,

251
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,140
 but I tell you that if you look at someone with lust,

252
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,420
 you're an adulterer.

253
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,960
 Jesus says over and over again,

254
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,460
 you've heard it said, but I tell you.

255
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,460
 And he brings clarity that you guys

256
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,580
 are all about the letter of the law.

257
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,140
 And let me give clarity to the spirit of the law,

258
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,380
 what it was always intended to mean.

259
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,860
 It's as though he was saying to us,

260
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,860
 you've heard it said you shouldn't drive 70.

261
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,140
 I say you should only drive 30,

262
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,220
 or you shouldn't drive a car, you should take a bike.

263
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,140
 Jesus says, I've come to explain the intended meaning

264
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,460
 or to raise the standard

265
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,460
 to where it was always intended to be.

266
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,460
 And the second way Jesus really fulfills the law,

267
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,960
 so that he brings clarity to, oh man,

268
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,460
 anger and murder, they're not far apart.

269
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,300
 In fact, according to Jesus, they're the same thing.

270
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,540
 The second way that he does is that he lives,

271
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,020
 he fulfills the law by living the perfect life.

272
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,740
 The only person for thousands of years,

273
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,460
 Jews would have these 613 different commands

274
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,940
 and there were 10 big ones,

275
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,100
 you've heard probably called the 10 commandments

276
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,500
 that Charles and Heston came down with the mountain from.

277
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,380
 And he, Jesus, was the only person

278
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,220
 who perfectly could live the mountain.

279
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,540
 He's the only person standing at the end of Simon says.

280
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,140
 He's the only person who is able

281
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,980
 to fully fulfill what the law required to do what it says.

282
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,220
 In fact, even in one scene, Jesus,

283
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,900
 his crowd continues to grow

284
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,700
 and there's this group called the Pharisees

285
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,900
 who doesn't like Jesus stepping on their turf.

286
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,180
 And so like, hey buddy, get your own city,

287
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,060
 Jerusalem's ours.

288
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,580
 And the crowd is gathering around him

289
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,060
 and they say, we're gonna kill this man.

290
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,060
 And Jesus responds, what sin would you convict me of?

291
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,500
 What sin have I committed?

292
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,460
 And it's literally this like awkward silence

293
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,140
 and Jesus just walks off.

294
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,860
 That there was never a time where he broke the law.

295
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,060
 Second way he fulfilled it was by his life.

296
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,860
 And then the third and really most important

297
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,180
 and most emphasized in the Bible

298
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,420
 way that Jesus fulfilled the law

299
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,420
 was that he fulfilled its demands for you and for me.

300
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,860
 And a lot of you guys know this,

301
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,500
 but this may be a review,

302
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,880
 maybe you haven't heard this before.

303
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,200
 Jesus steps in and he fulfills what you and I,

304
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,660
 when we broke the law or did not live up to God's standard,

305
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,060
 when we were angry, when we were lustful or adulterers,

306
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,100
 Jesus would say.

307
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,500
 Anytime those sins were done, there's a debt created.

308
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,040
 There's a penalty that must be paid

309
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,900
 and Jesus fulfills the law by saying,

310
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,340
 I will pay fully for everything that you have ever done.

311
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,640
 For anyone who will trust in me,

312
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,640
 I will totally satisfy the righteous requirement

313
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,720
 or the requirement and the debt that you've created.

314
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,840
 It's like you got a speeding ticket in that scenario

315
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,640
 and Jesus says, I'll pay for it.

316
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,160
 I'll cover the gap that you created by your decisions.

317
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,880
 Jesus is the fulfiller of the law

318
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,920
 and we're gonna really come back to that.

319
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,080
 But it's not dissimilar from Jesus stepping in

320
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,520
 and filling what is lacking from when you,

321
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,160
 this is the best way I can say it.

322
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,200
 I don't know if you're like me,

323
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,760
 but the dentist, I like avoid the dentist like the plague.

324
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,480
 And it is probably not good for my teeth.

325
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,580
 In fact, I know it's not.

326
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,040
 But I think it's because my first experience

327
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,200
 at the dentist was when I was 22.

328
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,200
 So, ouch, okay.

329
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,040
 So, everyone's laughing.

330
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,480
 I don't know, that's hurtful.

331
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,320
 So when I was growing up, I was raised by a single mom

332
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,080
 and we didn't have dental insurance.

333
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,040
 She was like, your teeth are straight, get back in the game.

334
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,180
 And so she would, we never went to the dentist.

335
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,800
 And so my first time to the dentist, I was 22

336
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,440
 and I was like, I feel like I should just go.

337
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,280
 I'm out on my own.

338
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,680
 This probably seems right.

339
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,620
 So I go to the dentist and I sit down,

340
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,920
 explain the scenario to the dentist.

341
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,040
 And he takes the x-rays and I'm like,

342
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,280
 everything's exciting for me 'cause I've never been.

343
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,240
 I'm like, this chair, it leans back.

344
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,520
 This is awesome.

345
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,800
 And he comes in and he's like, hey, this is great.

346
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,060
 Well, I've got some bad news

347
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,900
 and I need to ask you some questions

348
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,240
 in light of that bad news.

349
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,680
 And I said, okay, great, what's the bad news?

350
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,600
 And he said, well, you have 14 cavities.

351
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,340
 I'm like, did you double check?

352
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,180
 Did you count that?

353
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,020
 Are you sure?

354
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,860
 You have 14?

355
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,560
 And he goes, yes, pulls him up, shows me.

356
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
 And I'm like, how can that be?

357
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,560
 He begins to say, tell me about how much soda

358
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,960
 you're drinking.

359
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
 Do you put sugar in your coffee?

360
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,760
 Are you sleeping with candy in your mouth?

361
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,400
 What are you doing that is causing all of these cavities?

362
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
 And I'm like, what?

363
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,620
 Is that wrong?

364
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,620
 And of course, what he does is he goes in

365
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,240
 and he begins to fill all of the cavities.

366
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,380
 All of the holes or all of the decay

367
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,860
 that through my decisions had been brought into my life.

368
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,560
 Jesus comes, or the dentist comes.

369
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,500
 (congregation laughing)

370
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,200
 Jesus came in that day.

371
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,440
 (congregation laughing)

372
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,780
 And, oh man, gotta get more sleep.

373
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,940
 And the dentist fills in what's lacking.

374
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,460
 In the same way,

375
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,660
 Jesus says, I'm going to come and fill in

376
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,460
 what is lacking or what decay, destruction,

377
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,240
 you have brought into your life through poor decisions.

378
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,820
 Whatever holes, cavities, things you've created

379
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,420
 by your decisions, by your mistakes,

380
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,860
 by past relationships, by past addiction,

381
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,060
 by a current addiction, by poor decisions, sin.

382
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,620
 Jesus said, I will fill what is lacking.

383
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,660
 He's the fulfiller of those things.

384
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,120
 And really, that's not only what he says,

385
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,340
 but he tells us about how our relationship

386
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,540
 to the law exists today.

387
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,860
 Here's what he says, verse 18.

388
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,220
 For truly, I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear,

389
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,140
 not the smallest letter nor the least stroke of the pen

390
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,100
 will by any means disappear from the law

391
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,540
 until everything is accomplished.

392
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,860
 Therefore, anyone who sets aside

393
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,140
 one of the least of these commands

394
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,260
 and teaches others to do accordingly

395
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,860
 will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.

396
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,060
 But whoever practices and teaches these commands

397
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,340
 will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

398
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,380
 This brings us to our second point

399
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,620
 of what role does the law play for us today?

400
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,560
 Because Jesus just said, the Old Testament,

401
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,980
 all the laws are still in play

402
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,140
 until their intended purpose has been accomplished.

403
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,720
 Until it's been totally achieved,

404
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,860
 until their purpose has been accomplished.

405
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,220
 In other words, all the laws that make up the 613 laws

406
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,420
 in the first half of your Bible,

407
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,380
 if you ever wonder why, if we're set free in Christ from law

408
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,220
 why do we have these?

409
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,060
 Jesus just said, until each one of those laws

410
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,380
 reaches their intended purpose

411
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,460
 or accomplishes the fullness for which they were given,

412
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,860
 they will not be done away with.

413
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,700
 Now here's why that's significant

414
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,060
 and here's how that relates to us.

415
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,940
 So when we look at the Old Testament,

416
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,520
 we really, we see 613 laws that are broken up

417
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,900
 into three different categories.

418
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,300
 And the first two are kind of similar

419
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,100
 in that they deal with specific instructions

420
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,940
 to the nation of Israel.

421
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,860
 So God sets up the nation of Israel,

422
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,140
 says hey, this is what you're gonna do,

423
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,420
 this is what you're gonna do.

424
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,380
 Not because I'm trying to rip you off,

425
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,940
 I'm trying to give you life.

426
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,620
 I'm trying to set you free.

427
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,220
 I'm trying to lead you towards life.

428
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,500
 So he gives them all these rules

429
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,980
 and inside of the laws that we see there,

430
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,180
 the first two of those three categories

431
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,440
 are the ceremonial and the civil.

432
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,260
 They're like specific to the nation of Israel.

433
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,180
 This is how you're gonna govern yourself.

434
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,780
 This is how your kings should act.

435
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,460
 This is how you should do these things.

436
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,180
 This is the kind of food you should eat.

437
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,940
 You shouldn't eat shellfish.

438
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,780
 That was included in there,

439
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,940
 we're gonna come back to that.

440
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,820
 And the ceremonial, whenever you sin,

441
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,860
 or when you do this sin, something has to die

442
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,840
 or there has to be shedding of blood.

443
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,980
 I want you to associate that with the payment.

444
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,700
 So God says nation of Israel,

445
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,080
 these are specific in how you're to act within society.

446
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,380
 So those are that set of laws.

447
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,520
 Those two out of the three groups.

448
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,060
 The third group, and those both of the other two

449
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,520
 have been, and Christ would go on to teach,

450
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,340
 and really his disciples, fulfilled by Jesus on the cross.

451
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,100
 You don't have to sacrifice goats anymore

452
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,220
 because Jesus was the perfect sacrifice.

453
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,540
 All of those things reached

454
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,700
 and achieved their intended purpose, Jesus would say.

455
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,820
 But the third group of laws that we see

456
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,740
 is what's called the moral laws.

457
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,660
 These are the moral laws.

458
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,960
 These are what the 10 commandments really would fall into.

459
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,940
 These are the laws you shouldn't steal,

460
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,220
 you shouldn't commit adultery, you shouldn't lie,

461
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,560
 you shouldn't commit murder.

462
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,920
 All these different moral laws

463
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,220
 that really indicate timeless things

464
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,900
 that their fullness has not been accomplished yet.

465
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,340
 In other words, the laws,

466
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,500
 when it comes to the Old Testament that we keep

467
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,420
 are the ones that are the moral instructions.

468
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,540
 They provide for us what our relationship

469
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,160
 or what laws we're supposed to keep

470
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,940
 inside of the Old Testament.

471
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,080
 And really, it's not that we're to keep those

472
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,440
 because they make us have right standing with God.

473
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,620
 In other words, a Christian is made a Christian

474
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,740
 by Jesus on the cross.

475
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,620
 You guys following me on this?

476
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,940
 It's really heady stuff, we're going ancient Judaism.

477
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,300
 The Christian is made a Christian by Jesus dying.

478
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,180
 And so why would I have to keep any laws?

479
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,620
 If I trust in Christ alone, I get to have eternal life.

480
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,540
 The reason we keep moral laws

481
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,940
 is not to have a relationship with God,

482
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,820
 but because we have a relationship with God.

483
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,980
 God didn't give the nation of Israel

484
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,660
 a bunch of moral laws because he wanted to rip them off.

485
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,700
 He wanted to protect them.

486
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,920
 I love you.

487
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,380
 We don't do it to, we don't keep the moral laws

488
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,460
 to earn God's love, but to experience his love.

489
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,300
 Does that make sense?

490
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,260
 There's a huge difference.

491
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,140
 And so when it relates to the Old Testament,

492
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,520
 which one should we follow, which one should we not?

493
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,820
 We know that the moral laws are the ones

494
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,340
 that have not been fully accomplished according to Jesus.

495
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,900
 And those are given to us not to bind us up,

496
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,700
 but to set us free or to give us life in following them.

497
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,440
 It's really not dissimilar from when I was in high school,

498
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,260
 there were certain laws that I had to abide by

499
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,140
 because I was underneath the authority of the high school.

500
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,100
 And while I was there, even though,

501
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,860
 or while I was there, I would get,

502
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,140
 if I didn't show up to first period class,

503
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,100
 we would get demerits.

504
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,540
 My team made fun of me today 'cause they were like,

505
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,360
 who got demerits?

506
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,200
 We got demerits.

507
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,380
 And I would show up, and if I didn't show up on time,

508
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
 I would get demerits.

509
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,860
 And if I got three demerits, you had to go to detention.

510
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,060
 So if I didn't abide by that rule, I got in trouble.

511
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,780
 Now, there were other laws

512
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,700
 that I would also get a demerit for,

513
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,500
 such as running in the hallway with scissors.

514
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,540
 And I don't know why that would be appealing to anyone,

515
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,780
 but especially in high school.

516
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,020
 But if you did that, you would get in trouble.

517
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,460
 Now, both of those were laws.

518
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,100
 And although I've graduated from high school

519
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,640
 and am no longer under the tyranny of high school,

520
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,480
 and can do, I can run all I want with scissors,

521
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,920
 I don't have to be at class on time,

522
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,200
 and I can run with scissors,

523
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,440
 but the principle behind running with scissors still exists.

524
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,680
 It's still not a good idea.

525
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,400
 Poke your eye out, die.

526
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,200
 And that's what God has, that's what God,

527
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,440
 even though we've graduated from the Old Testament law

528
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,160
 of relating to God,

529
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,360
 there are still laws and still moral revelations

530
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,020
 or still moral will, God's moral will that's revealed

531
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,020
 that it's still not a good idea to murder,

532
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,620
 even though that's not gonna affect

533
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,880
 my relationship with Christ,

534
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,900
 even though we've graduated from the system of the law.

535
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,780
 Does that make sense?

536
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,980
 So those are the laws as it relates to the Old Testament

537
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,060
 that haven't been accomplished,

538
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,740
 and those are the ones that still apply to us today.

539
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,860
 Because God is a God who loves you and loves me.

540
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,820
 And he gives us not just the letter of the law,

541
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,220
 but the spirit, I have an intention behind it

542
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,240
 to protect you.

543
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,560
 Why could you not eat shellfish,

544
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,940
 and why would homosexuality be wrong?

545
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,740
 The nation of Israel didn't eat shellfish,

546
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,860
 and you're gonna hear this if you haven't heard it yet,

547
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,820
 especially with as much of a issue

548
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,220
 as just sexuality in general is in our culture,

549
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,860
 but homosexuality right now, this is a common argument.

550
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,540
 How come you can eat shrimp, but you can't be homosexual?

551
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,380
 Or we would say that would not be something to do.

552
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,300
 And the reason is, the reason God outlawed shrimp

553
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,100
 at this time, to the best of our understanding,

554
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,820
 is because in ancient, you can still research this today,

555
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,220
 in ancient cultures, the shrimp were bottom dwellers,

556
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,580
 and they were, because of the nature of that

557
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,200
 and the cleansing abilities at that time,

558
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,380
 they were unable to clean them.

559
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,540
 God basically says, I wanna protect you.

560
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,980
 The reason I don't wanna eat pig,

561
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,740
 pig has this worm that is unique to pig inside of it,

562
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,100
 if it's not cooked, or if it's in a pig herd,

563
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,460
 where they're infested with that,

564
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,540
 and God says, I want to protect you.

565
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,020
 I was gonna say, you guys know pigs don't sweat?

566
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,700
 That's another thing that kinda messes me.

567
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,300
 We're just gonna keep moving on.

568
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,500
 Maybe that, I wouldn't be surprised if we get up there

569
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,920
 and God's like, you ate the pig?

570
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,700
 Really, I told you not to eat the pig.

571
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,020
 Anyways, so the reason why we would say those things,

572
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,980
 because now we're able to, to the best of our ability,

573
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,500
 the intent behind the law was protection.

574
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,700
 Now, based on how we can clean things,

575
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,380
 we're no longer in danger of those certain things.

576
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,160
 Things like marriage, divorce, stealing,

577
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,860
 these things haven't changed.

578
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,180
 Homosexuality has not changed.

579
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,260
 And if that wasn't enough,

580
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,860
 the New Testament also addresses that issue.

581
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,700
 And if that's something you would love to hear more about,

582
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,860
 we'd love to talk to you.

583
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,020
 And there's resources on the Porch app

584
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,140
 we'd love to point you to, Same Love.

585
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,860
 There's a message JP did during Lyrics and Lies,

586
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,860
 it's one of the best messages I've ever heard on the topic.

587
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,380
 Please go listen to it.

588
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,660
 Okay, so moving on.

589
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,380
 And what does it relate to our ability to experience

590
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,740
 what the law was meant to point us to?

591
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,220
 Or what does Jesus have to say

592
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,660
 with our righteousness that heaven requires?

593
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,740
 What does Jesus have to say,

594
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,980
 which is what he's about to tell us?

595
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,900
 And he finishes and gives maybe the most radical statement

596
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,500
 Jesus ever gave, and he gave a lot of them.

597
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,220
 For I tell you that unless your righteousness

598
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,560
 surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,

599
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,260
 you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

600
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,580
 I'm gonna read it again.

601
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,380
 For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses

602
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,940
 that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,

603
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,140
 you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

604
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,980
 At this point, his audience is sucking air going,

605
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,020
 "What, what did he just say?"

606
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,860
 Okay, this guy needs to go back to carpentry

607
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,740
 'cause preaching is not his thing.

608
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,220
 They're all going, "How can that even be possible?"

609
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,660
 He uses the word, unless your righteousness surpasses,

610
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,660
 it's really the word excels abundantly.

611
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,500
 Unless your righteousness excels abundantly

612
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,300
 beyond the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,

613
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,140
 you won't enter.

614
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,460
 Who were the Pharisees and teachers of the law?

615
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,780
 They were the most religious men, disciplined men

616
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,140
 that the world had seen.

617
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,860
 Today, even the Hasidic Jews that we know of,

618
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,140
 pale in comparison to the laws

619
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,660
 that these men would have followed.

620
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,740
 They were men and women who kept not only all 613 rules

621
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,660
 in the Old Testament and memorized them,

622
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,980
 most of you haven't even read most of the Old Testament,

623
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,860
 they memorized it.

624
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,340
 And not only that, they added 1,500 different rules to it.

625
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,260
 They added a bunch of other rules

626
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,940
 to make sure they wouldn't get close to breaking the 613.

627
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,740
 And in order to not break the third commandment,

628
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,200
 you shall not take God's name in vain,

629
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,220
 they said, we're not even gonna say God's name.

630
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,260
 We're not even gonna mention it.

631
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,460
 So anytime we're gonna pray, we're just gonna go,

632
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,700
 you know what I'm talking about.

633
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,540
 That would be what they do.

634
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,380
 They wouldn't mention it today.

635
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,780
 I mean, you've probably seen this.

636
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,940
 They would not mention the law.

637
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,340
 They had this group of Pharisees

638
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,820
 that were like the super religious Pharisees,

639
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,900
 and they were the ones called the bleeding Pharisees.

640
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
 Here's why.

641
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,500
 Pharisees would walk around with their head bowed

642
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,260
 in order to not be tempted to look at a woman

643
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,100
 and have sexual temptation.

644
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,560
 And the bleeding Pharisees were the ones

645
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,300
 who were so committed that they kept on bumping into walls,

646
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,980
 and it was a badge of honor to be covered in blood

647
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,060
 because they were so committed to not breaking the law.

648
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,460
 They had laws around the amount of work.

649
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,980
 You could only carry a fig.

650
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,540
 Anything that weighed more than a fig on the Sabbath,

651
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,040
 you could not carry.

652
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,580
 These were the elite of elite.

653
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,620
 If anyone was good at being religious,

654
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,420
 at keeping the rules, it was them.

655
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,380
 And Jesus just said, not even they are even close.

656
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,100
 You need to excel abundantly beyond where they are.

657
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,700
 This is like me saying, look,

658
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,020
 this is how his audience would have heard it.

659
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,220
 Unless you're better at basketball than LeBron James,

660
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,260
 you will not enter the kingdom,

661
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,780
 or Steph Curry, based on his track record.

662
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,820
 Unless you're better than he at basketball,

663
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,940
 you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

664
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,440
 Or unless you're more generous than Bill Gates,

665
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,020
 who was named last week the most generous human

666
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
 that's ever lived.

667
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,220
 Unless you're more generous, you're going,

668
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,840
 what, that's impossible.

669
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,620
 Or unless you're more pure than Mother Teresa,

670
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,460
 you're going, what?

671
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,860
 Wait, David, she was a nun.

672
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,360
 She wasn't married.

673
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,740
 Yeah, unless you're more pure.

674
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,180
 Wait, but she never had sex.

675
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,380
 She never kissed a guy.

676
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,600
 Unless you're more pure.

677
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,900
 And his audience is going, what?

678
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,740
 How can this be?

679
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,920
 If that's the case, no one's good enough.

680
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,020
 How can that be possible?

681
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,340
 And if it wasn't bad enough already,

682
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,020
 Jesus, a few verses later, would say this.

683
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:56,700
 You, therefore, this is verse 48 of chapter five,

684
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,200
 must be perfect, as your heavenly Father

685
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,180
 is perfect.

686
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,740
 And they're going, Jesus, it was already hard enough.

687
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,000
 I mean, you're coming and making it even harder on us.

688
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,280
 How, no one can be good enough.

689
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,060
 And Jesus would say, that's the point.

690
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,580
 That's why he would start the message

691
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,820
 with his thesis statement we talked about last week.

692
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,520
 Blessed are the poor in spirit,

693
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,500
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

694
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,140
 In other words, what does God require

695
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,580
 in order to get into heaven?

696
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,020
 You gotta be perfect.

697
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,220
 What, Jesus, perfect?

698
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,480
 No one can be perfect.

699
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,280
 You gotta be perfect if you wanna experience heaven.

700
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
 Well, how does that connect to blessed are the poor

701
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,360
 in spirit, because Jesus taught in what

702
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,580
 the New Testament teaches is that there is

703
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,800
 a perfect righteousness that is only found in Jesus

704
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,000
 and that he offers freely to anyone who will take it.

705
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,340
 In other words, poor in spirit is someone

706
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,000
 who's spiritually bankrupt, who says,

707
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,860
 I know on my own, I can't get in.

708
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,560
 I do not deserve God's love.

709
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,380
 I do not deserve to experience eternity with him.

710
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,300
 I am spiritually bankrupt.

711
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,700
 And Jesus says, that's the person who's a perfect candidate

712
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,180
 to have a relationship with me, to have eternal life.

713
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,820
 But the person who says, no, no, no,

714
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,980
 I'm a pretty good person.

715
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,940
 I think I can do it.

716
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,860
 I'm gonna follow these rules.

717
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,260
 I'm gonna make sure I only carry a fig.

718
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,820
 That person, they'll never make it

719
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,400
 because you gotta be perfect.

720
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,220
 But the person who says, I know I'll never get there,

721
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,600
 Jesus says, yours is the kingdom of heaven

722
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,960
 because I've offered a free gift.

723
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,560
 If you'll just accept it, you can earn it.

724
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,240
 This is why Jesus would say later to the Pharisees,

725
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,420
 this religious, they always went to church.

726
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,840
 They were the seminary grads.

727
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,940
 The prostitutes go in before you do to the kingdom of heaven.

728
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,320
 You guys who have totally oriented your life

729
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,440
 around keeping God's law, the prostitutes,

730
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,200
 the thieves, sinners will enter the kingdom before you will

731
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,080
 because you're self-righteous.

732
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,900
 Here's the hard thing about self-righteousness.

733
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,960
 It's hard to see in the mirror.

734
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,800
 Like most of us in the room, we go,

735
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,960
 no, I'm not self-righteous.

736
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,080
 I mean, I'm great with carrying way more than figs on Sunday.

737
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,720
 I'm not self-righteous at all.

738
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,040
 The most common example of self-righteousness

739
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,100
 is really what I think is probably the most common belief

740
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,720
 in our country.

741
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,240
 It's the belief that I'm a pretty good person.

742
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,400
 Like if someone was to come up to you and ask,

743
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,880
 hey, if you were to die today,

744
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,920
 do you think you'd go to heaven?

745
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,080
 And your answer would be, yeah, yeah, I think so.

746
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,920
 And they said, well, why?

747
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,960
 And you said, well, I'm a pretty good person.

748
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,760
 I mean, I'm not the best, I'm not perfect,

749
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,040
 but I'm better than most people.

750
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,720
 I'm not Hitler and I pay my taxes

751
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,220
 and I try to be a nice person.

752
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,600
 Self-righteous, depending on yourself

753
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,700
 for your righteousness.

754
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,580
 All those things are connected to self.

755
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,820
 And Jesus says, if you are self-righteous,

756
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,140
 if you depend on yourself for righteousness,

757
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,200
 you will not be righteous enough

758
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,820
 because the standard is perfection.

759
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,580
 And I think the scariest thing

760
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,340
 is that so many of us in the room

761
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,020
 have bought into that lie,

762
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,980
 that I'm a pretty good person.

763
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,220
 I mean, I may have done some mistakes,

764
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,540
 but I try to be nice and I try to be kind.

765
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,140
 And really what we buy into is this idea

766
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,100
 that somehow our deeds,

767
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,060
 and this is every major world religion.

768
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,380
 So Jesus would say, all of them,

769
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,580
 if they wanna get in, they have to be perfect,

770
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,180
 unless they wanna accept me and my perfect righteousness

771
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,740
 that I'll give them freely.

772
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,540
 But he says, look, if you wanna depend on yourself,

773
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,340
 you've gotta be perfect.

774
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,500
 And all of us would say, look,

775
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,940
 I think God will probably,

776
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,780
 or a lot of us would say,

777
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,220
 God would probably accept me 'cause I'm a good person.

778
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,220
 I've done some bad things,

779
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,780
 but I try to outweigh them by some good things.

780
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,500
 And Jesus would say, that doesn't work.

781
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,540
 I mean, we know this doesn't work.

782
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:11,500
 If I was to hit your car or cause damage,

783
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,020
 burn down your house, and I won't.

784
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,360
 But if I was to do something to you,

785
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,020
 and then I was like, look, all right,

786
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,220
 so that's behind us.

787
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,380
 But how about I bring you Starbucks every Friday

788
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,220
 for the next six months?

789
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,060
 That would be nice, right?

790
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,340
 It wouldn't make up for it.

791
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,700
 We know that, and even if you're going,

792
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,620
 that's too extreme.

793
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,940
 Those are way on the opposite ends of the spectrum.

794
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,100
 If someone was to hurt your child,

795
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,740
 or hurt your parents, or kill your close friend,

796
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,200
 you wouldn't be like, yeah, that's fine.

797
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,140
 Just try to be nice to me.

798
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,540
 We know that it doesn't make up for it.

799
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,980
 And yet this is such a common belief

800
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,580
 that if we just are good,

801
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,760
 and Jesus says that's self-righteousness,

802
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,520
 and as long as you trust in self,

803
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,620
 you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

804
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,220
 You will go to hell.

805
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:08,620
 Jesus alone fulfills the law,

806
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,700
 and he alone offers the payment

807
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,340
 for the debt that our sin has created.

808
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,340
 What Jesus is showing in this verse

809
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,340
 is that you and I have an inability to keep the law.

810
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:30,740
 And not only that, we have an inability to pay for our sins.

811
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,060
 We can't afford it.

812
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,100
 It's too high.

813
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,420
 And even if we could, the sins keep piling up

814
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,460
 and piling up.

815
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,340
 But Jesus says, if you'll trust in me,

816
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,540
 if you'll trust in me,

817
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,260
 if you'll trust in my perfect righteousness,

818
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,180
 you can have eternal life

819
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,220
 based on whatever you've done,

820
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,860
 no matter what you've done.

821
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,040
 If you'll accept that free gift, it's yours.

822
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,800
 When I was, my first year on staff at Watermark,

823
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,060
 it was six years ago, and I was in grad school.

824
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,580
 And I was part-time here and full-time in school,

825
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,100
 and I was making 700 bucks a month.

826
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,540
 So I was rolling in it,

827
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,620
 and I was trying to make ends meet,

828
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,860
 and I'm trying to pay tuition bills.

829
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,420
 And I was literally homeless.

830
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,480
 I didn't have a home.

831
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,040
 I was living with this family in their spare bedroom,

832
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,260
 and doing odd jobs on the side,

833
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,980
 power washing and giving plasma,

834
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,340
 and trying to pay bills.

835
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,180
 And during that time,

836
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,260
 I was able to kind of make ends meet

837
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
 for one of the semesters,

838
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,100
 and then I was looking towards the next semester,

839
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,340
 and I still had debt behind me

840
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,820
 from already one semester of school,

841
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,180
 and I was looking towards the next one,

842
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,940
 and I got my bill for the second semester,

843
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,320
 and I was going, oh my gosh,

844
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,380
 I feel like I'm never gonna be able to pay this off.

845
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,540
 I'm never gonna get out of this.

846
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,600
 Because the minute that I can pay a little bit

847
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,580
 from this $700 a month,

848
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:59,340
 the higher and higher the debt continues to get.

849
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,300
 You have a debt, and I have a debt

850
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,340
 that we'll never be able to pay off.

851
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,620
 No matter how good you think you are,

852
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,820
 how good you could live for the rest of your life,

853
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,660
 the debt will only continue to grow,

854
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,860
 and get higher and bigger,

855
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
 and you'll never be able to pay it off.

856
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,740
 I went into the family's home

857
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,620
 to really kind of say goodbye.

858
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,460
 It was Christmas break,

859
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,600
 and I was gonna go home to Houston,

860
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,460
 which is where I was from, or am from.

861
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,500
 And I went in, and basically it was Christmas break,

862
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,340
 and so, hey, goodbye, Merry Christmas.

863
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,300
 And they handed me this letter,

864
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,460
 and they said, hey, we wanna give you something.

865
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,520
 And I opened it up, and it said, it's been paid for.

866
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,780
 We paid for the debt that you owed.

867
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,620
 We covered it.

868
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,780
 And immediately, I'm going,

869
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,780
 this mixture of like gratitude, and like what, how,

870
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,220
 and humbling, and I'm going, how's that even,

871
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,940
 how did you even know who to call to pay that off?

872
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,260
 How were you able to do that?

873
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,220
 I thought, no, no, no, this is too much.

874
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,060
 It's too much.

875
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,060
 I need to pay you back.

876
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,900
 I need to do something.

877
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,260
 I need to go, I'll mow the lawn for a while.

878
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,660
 And they're like, we have a lawn boy.

879
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,960
 We have several, actually, so you're not gonna make a debt.

880
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,240
 And it was in that moment, really,

881
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,240
 that I was reminded, that's what Christ has done for you,

882
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,740
 and for me.

883
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,740
 There's a debt that you couldn't pay

884
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,740
 that kept getting bigger and bigger,

885
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,060
 and he said, I'll pay it.

886
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,100
 I'll pay for it, and whoever will put their trust in me,

887
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,740
 I'll pay for it.

888
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,500
 Whoever will say, Jesus, on the cross,

889
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,060
 I believe that you died for me,

890
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,820
 for everything that I've ever done,

891
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,140
 and you paid for it on the cross.

892
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,660
 You paid for my abortion.

893
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,520
 You paid for my pornography.

894
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,660
 You paid for my materialism.

895
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,180
 You paid for my anxiety.

896
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,740
 You paid for it, and I don't deserve it,

897
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,340
 but I'm trusting in that.

898
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,060
 Jesus to that person says,

899
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:07,000
 you have perfect righteousness, now and forever.

900
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,940
 The sins you haven't committed, think about that.

901
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,540
 You haven't even committed yet,

902
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,120
 the sins in your future, paid for, totally paid for.

903
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,240
 And that's the message that Jesus offers,

904
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,300
 and standing on that hillside,

905
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,820
 he would go on to tell them,

906
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,200
 unless you have perfect righteousness,

907
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,640
 we can't be perfect, that's the point.

908
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,540
 But I am, and I've paid for it.

909
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,740
 Will you just accept it?

910
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,300
 But God, you don't know what I've done,

911
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,260
 or when I look behind me, I've stolen, I've cheated,

912
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,420
 I've committed adultery, I paid for it.

913
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,100
 I paid for it.

914
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,260
 Will you trust in me?

915
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,940
 All of the Bible can be summarized down to two words.

916
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,040
 Trust me, that God speaks to humanity.

917
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,400
 I love you, and I paid for it.

918
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,880
 Jesus is the fulfiller of the law.

919
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,580
 He's the only one who can keep it.

920
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:12,280
 And he's paid for all the lawbreakers like me,

921
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,640
 and like you, and anyone who would trust in him.

922
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,200
 I'm gonna pray that we do that.

923
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,540
 Father, we love you, some of us do.

924
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,780
 Regardless, we all need you.

925
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:33,780
 We all have sins in our past, actions,

926
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,740
 mistakes, things that we've done.

927
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,340
 Some that we regret, some that we don't even remember,

928
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,940
 and you speak over all of us.

929
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,300
 I've paid for them.

930
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,900
 Will you trust me?

931
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,220
 Father, I pray for my friends in the room

932
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,260
 who have a past of sin and pain,

933
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,440
 and poor decisions that mark all of us.

934
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,580
 But they don't know you.

935
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,660
 They're self-righteous, even though they don't know

936
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,820
 or believe that, they're trusting in themselves.

937
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,960
 Would you, by your Spirit, be heavy on their hearts now,

938
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,100
 reminding them and reminding us all that we need you,

939
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,700
 and you alone offer the payment

940
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,900
 for all that we've ever done?

941
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,380
 We love you, amen.

942
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:34,380
