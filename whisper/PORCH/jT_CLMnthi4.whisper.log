[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:36.640]   All right, Porsche, let's go.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.880]   How we doing?
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.600]   We doing OK?
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.440]   It's great to see you.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.840]   Man, it makes my week every weekend to be here with you.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.900]   Thanks so much for choosing to be here at the Porsche,
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.080]   not just in Dallas, Texas, but also all over the globe.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.160]   There's so many people tuning in with us all over the place.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.760]   And so we want to just say a special hello.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.880]   If you're tuning in with us online somewhere,
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.520]   from wherever it is you stream, or if you're listening to this
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.240]   at some point in the future, welcome.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.440]   We're really glad to have you here.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.520]   Special shout out to Portslife, Dayton, Scottsdale, and Boise.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.600]   Let's give it up.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.080]   Hey, I want to do an exercise with you.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.360]   Now listen, this is going to be a rhetorical exercise.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.980]   I do not need you to speak back to me.
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.840]   I need you to think in the quietness of your inner self.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.340]   I want you to go through the halls of your personal history
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.840]   back to that very first moment where you felt
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.640]   some sense of personal panic, like some social embarrassment.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.180]   You can work your way back there while I tell you about mine,
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.280]   because mine was when I was in the seventh grade
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.000]   and I joined the football team for the very first time.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.800]   I know.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.120]   I had not grown up playing football.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.880]   I had been around sports, baseball, soccer,
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.080]   but I had never really spent any time around football.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080]   I didn't watch it.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   I didn't know the rules.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.360]   I didn't know the position.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.040]   And yet what I knew is that I had a bunch of friends
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.440]   that were all joining the team, and so I was eager to jump
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.120]   on board with them as well.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.160]   So the day comes, and we make our way out
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.080]   to try out for a specific position.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.960]   But I didn't know anything about the sport,
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.040]   and so I picked the only position that I knew of.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.120]   I chose to try out for quarterback.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.120]   Did I know any professional quarterbacks?
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.840]   No.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.640]   Did I know how to spin the peel?
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.360]   No, I did not.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.480]   Did I know that it was the most important position
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.580]   on the team?
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.760]   Of course not.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.600]   I just simply knew that this was an important position to--
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.680]   this was a position that everybody knew about.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.400]   And so the day came for me to try out,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.440]   and what I found out is that the tryout's really
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.800]   just a matter of you self-selecting
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.640]   into what you wanted.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.840]   So I got put into this position, and it was amazing.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.720]   I started learning the role really well,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.640]   and then eventually, as season started to approach,
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.520]   we got delegated into a variety of different teams.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.360]   Much to my surprise, I was put on the A team, which
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.960]   was surprising to me because, listen, I was not
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.840]   under the illusion that I was God's gift to the sport
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.960]   of football.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.960]   I knew that I had worked really hard,
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.240]   that I had given it the good college try,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.920]   that I had showed up early and I had stayed late.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.240]   And I thought, man, this is just my coaches recognizing
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.680]   the fact that I had really gone for it.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.840]   And so they're rewarding all of my effort.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.160]   And so the day comes for us to make our journey
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.600]   to my very first football game.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.440]   I grab my gear.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.200]   I board the bus.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.400]   I say hey to my buddies, and we go to Paris, Texas.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.960]   And in Paris, Texas, we offload from the bus,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.720]   and I do what I always do.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.560]   I find my fellow quarterbacks, and I grab a ball,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.560]   and I start to warm up the old arm,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.360]   like eye socket to hip pocket.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.840]   I'm working my drills with these guys
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.520]   until eventually our coach comes over, and he does what he always
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.000]   does.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.800]   He does a head count.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.320]   And then he does a second head count.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.480]   And then he does a third head count.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.240]   Because come to find out, he had one more quarterback
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.400]   than he was expecting--
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.120]   me.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.000]   My name had accidentally been placed on the wrong roster.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.800]   And because I was not, in fact, qualified
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.400]   to quarterback the best of my 12-year-old companions,
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.440]   my coaches decided in that moment
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.760]   to remove me from the only position I was familiar with
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.640]   and put me in a completely different position
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.400]   that I had no familiarity with whatsoever.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.040]   This is the stuff of prepubescent panic.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.920]   OK?
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.960]   I was freaking out.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.880]   Like, my whole world had flipped upside down.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.240]   It felt like the sky was coming down on top of me
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.000]   because I was no longer playing on offense.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.800]   Now I was playing on defense.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.360]   I was no longer calling the shots on the field.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.560]   I was lost on the field.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.840]   I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.520]   I was not under the mistake that I was a part of the A team.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.640]   No, I actually thought that I had made the mistake
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.680]   of playing this sport to begin with.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.920]   You see, I had expected one thing,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.000]   but I experienced something completely different.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.440]   Now, why do I tell you that?
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.640]   Because for many of us, faith can feel the same way.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   Like you boarded the bus of belief
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.240]   and you made your way out to the big game
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.880]   and then you offloaded and you realized,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.680]   this is nothing like what I thought it was.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.720]   Like, I thought not just that I'm lost on the field,
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.560]   I'm actually lost in my faith.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.900]   It's not just that I am a part of the wrong roster.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.480]   I might be a part of the wrong religion.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.560]   It's not just that I'm questioning
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.640]   how to play this position.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.120]   I'm actually questioning all of my claims to belief.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.400]   Like, I'm in a position where I'm not sure
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.580]   that this is exactly what I thought it was supposed to be.
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.000]   I had some expectations,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   but my experience in walking with God
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.160]   has not panned out like I thought it would.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.920]   And the result is you've been left with disappointment.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.600]   Brene Brown in her book "Rising Strong,"
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.560]   she says, "Disappointment is unmet expectations."
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.320]   And the more significant the expectations,
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.080]   the more significant the disappointment.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.120]   And listen, there's nothing more significant
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.160]   about a person than what they believe about God.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.840]   Which is why today, many young adults,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.800]   some of you included,
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.080]   are actually on the road to deconstruction
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.960]   because your deconstruction from God
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.840]   is the result of your disappointment in God.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.040]   Now, here's the thing that we need to know.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.920]   When we wrestle with disappointment on God,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.280]   there's a variety of different reasons
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.160]   why that could be happening.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.820]   Like, it could be rooted
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.560]   in some sort of theological breakdown.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.480]   Like, you thought you believed one thing,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.120]   but then you learned something different,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.680]   and now your spirituality is spiraling.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.240]   It could be that you're facing a sociological dilemma.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.800]   Like, you know Christians, and you know what they claim,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.120]   but then you know the way they live,
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.760]   and all it feels like is hypocrisy,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.200]   and all you can do is question the claims they say
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.840]   are in fact true.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.400]   Maybe it's not theological, maybe it's not sociological,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.160]   maybe it's just circumstantial.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.360]   Like, you know God can show up,
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.520]   you know He will show up for others,
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.800]   but it just hasn't happened for you,
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.840]   and it feels like the circumstances in your life,
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.720]   they have gone from good to bad to worse.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.560]   And again and again, you found yourself
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.520]   facing the unfairness of life,
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.280]   having your hopes dashed against the rocks of reality.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.760]   Whatever the reason, for many people,
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.320]   their experience of Christianity
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.640]   is more synonymous with disappointment
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.220]   than enjoyment of God.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.220]   So, if you're here, and you're somewhere
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.460]   on the road to deconstruction,
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.340]   at the very least wrestling with your belief,
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.140]   and at the very most walking away from your belief,
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.300]   then you need to know this talk is for you.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.180]   Because we're gonna see Jesus engage with someone
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.040]   that is facing their own personal disappointment in God.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.860]   So if you have a Bible, you can grab it,
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.460]   and you can turn with me to Matthew chapter 11.
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.380]   We've been in a series called "Deconstructed"
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.060]   because we know now more than ever before,
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.500]   people are questioning their faith,
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.500]   and we don't think that's inherently a bad thing.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.300]   A.J. Swoboda says it in his book, "After Doubt."
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.660]   "Deconstruction is a double-edged sword.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.820]   "It can edify our faith
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.640]   "by helping us critically rethink wrong beliefs,
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.660]   "but it can also go too far and bring our faith to nothing."
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.580]   You see, there's a major difference in remodeling a room
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.540]   and tearing a house down.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.680]   One is taking a space and making it more livable.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.740]   The other is taking a space
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.940]   and rendering it completely inhospitable.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.900]   My goal in this series,
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.660]   if you're here for the very first time,
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.180]   is I want to make the space where your soul resides
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.340]   as livable as possible.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.460]   Like, I want your faith to flourish.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.460]   Like, I want your inner person to thrive.
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.940]   And yet what we often have to do
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.220]   is we have to critically evaluate our belief
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.540]   and see what parts are weak.
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.780]   Like, what in the foundation feels cracked?
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.540]   What do we actually need to reassess?
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.420]   And then what does it look like
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.080]   to not just deconstruct what feels weak,
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.100]   but actually reconstruct something strong in its place?
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.540]   That's what we've been doing.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.320]   And what we know is that as we step further
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.620]   inside the Christian story of reality,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.460]   what we often have to do
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.820]   is deal with the disappointments we feel about that reality,
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.700]   which is what Jesus is going to do
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.780]   with a guy by the name of John the Baptist tonight.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.780]   And so we'll pick it up
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.300]   as they kind of work through a series of steps
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.580]   on how to deal with disappointment.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.780]   So it says this, Matthew chapter 11,
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.740]   starting in verse one,
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.700]   we're just going to take it little by little.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.220]   "When Jesus had finished instructing his 12 disciples,
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.100]   "he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.600]   "Now, when John heard in prison
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.120]   "about the deeds of the Christ,
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.960]   "he sent word by his disciples and said to him,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.020]   "Are you the one who is to come
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.720]   "or shall we look for another?"
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.220]   Now, listen, if you know anything about John B,
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.660]   not John B from Outer Banks, but John B from the West Bank,
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.420]   what you need to know is that John the Baptist
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.020]   is Jesus' guy.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.460]   Like his entire story is one of effectively serving life.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.740]   Jesus is hype man.
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.580]   You know what that is?
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.620]   Like it's the guy that comes up
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.500]   before the main act takes the stage
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.780]   and gets the crowd excited
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.380]   and keeps injecting energy into the room,
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.780]   make sure the vibes are really great.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.980]   Like that's who John is.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.380]   He's the forerunner.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.180]   Like it says that he's the one
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.100]   who came to prepare the way for God's Messiah,
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.740]   the anointed one of Israel.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.100]   He baptized Jesus in the Jordan.
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.020]   He stood there and he heard the voice from heaven say,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.340]   "This is my son with whom I'm well pleased."
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.520]   He also was self-identified as the voice in the wilderness
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.540]   claiming make straight the ways of the Lord.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.640]   John was a spiritual giant.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.420]   Think about it in your own life.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.860]   Who is the best believer,
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.700]   like the fiercest of faith that you know?
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.860]   They don't stand a chance in comparison to John.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.180]   John is a spiritual savant,
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.020]   literally at the very beginning of his life
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.660]   while he's still in his mother's womb.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.860]   It says that he received the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.500]   The best of us does not have that going for him, okay?
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.460]   John was just built different.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.540]   And yet what we know is despite the fact that his history
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.780]   is marked by moments of incredible faithfulness
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.980]   in this story, what we find is a moment
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.140]   marked by weak faithfulness.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.140]   And the reason for that is disappointment.
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.860]   You see, John is in prison for doing the right thing.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.060]   He called out a wicked ruler by the name of Herod
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.700]   who had slept with his brother's wife, which is messed up.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.480]   She also happened to be Herod's niece,
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.380]   which is really messed up.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.580]   And so John is doing the only right thing
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.460]   and yet they're not facing judgment for their wrong.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.780]   He is facing judgment for his righteousness.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.740]   And that is disorienting.
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.460]   Like that's disillusioning.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.380]   That's disappointing.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.700]   Like, God, this is not the way it's supposed to be.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.180]   Like I'm doing the right thing.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.540]   I'm saying the right thing.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.060]   I'm taking the right stand.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.660]   Why God is this happening?
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.820]   Like Jesus, you're the one who's coming
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.620]   to deliver us from evil.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.420]   And yet it feels like I'm being delivered
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.860]   straight into evil's hands
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.540]   as I await my own execution.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.860]   If we're honest, some of us have felt that way
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.620]   or we feel that way here tonight with God.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.660]   We have felt disappointed with them.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.540]   We are asking the same question that John himself is asking.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.980]   Hey, are you sure you're the right one?
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.820]   No, no, no, hold on.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.640]   Let me clarify.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.820]   Are you actually the right one
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.340]   or do I need to be looking for someone else?
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.580]   Because I've had great expectations of who you are.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.660]   And yet my experience as I sit in prison
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.100]   for the last year to year and a half
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.620]   doesn't necessarily jive with what I expected.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:50.700]   You see, John is helping us realize the first point
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.300]   as we talk through disappointment tonight
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.900]   that disappointment can lead to disenchantment.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.840]   Disappointment can lead to disenchantment.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.620]   Like you know this feeling.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.980]   Like you go back and you watch a movie
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.260]   that you loved when you were a kid
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.220]   or you pull out all the toys that you used to play with
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.940]   or you go to the park, that place that you love
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.040]   from that time past or like me,
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.500]   maybe you collected rocks when you were a kid.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.660]   That's kind of a weird thing to admit,
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.020]   but you go back and you look at it
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:17.860]   and you're like, man, this is actually
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.380]   a pretty shambly collection of rocks.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.540]   I don't really know what I was doing.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.660]   I just kind of picked these things up
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.020]   at some point at some time in the past.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.780]   You look at the things you once took great delight in
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.460]   and yet you find them semi-disappointing
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.560]   because they're not what you thought.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.100]   And then really what it does
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.340]   is it disenchants the entire experience that you remember.
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.060]   That's what's happening right here.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.260]   That happens to Christians.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.800]   Like we experience something in the faith
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.660]   that doesn't match what we expect
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.540]   and it not only makes us sad, it makes us skeptical.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.060]   You wonder, Jesus, are you sure
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.860]   you're actually who you say you are?
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.060]   Are you someone different altogether?
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.540]   Because this is not playing out the way
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.020]   that I actually expected.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.600]   Maybe it happened in your own life.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.620]   Like you thought Jesus was supposed to be loving,
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.780]   but your experience with him has felt
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.620]   like he honestly could care less about you.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.740]   Maybe you thought Jesus was supposed to be in control
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.820]   and yet you're dealing with some stuff
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.140]   and it feels like he's nowhere to be found.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.100]   He has forgotten about you altogether.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.180]   Or maybe you thought Christianity
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.460]   was meant to be more fulfilling.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.260]   Like you've heard of this joy that Christians walk in
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.420]   and yet you've never found that.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.340]   You've heard of the peace
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.300]   that's supposed to surpass all understanding
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.980]   and yet you've never felt that.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.260]   You've heard of this forgiveness
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.780]   that transcends all wrongs
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.240]   and yet you don't know that you've ever received that.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.420]   Maybe it's not something
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.500]   that's actually happening in your life.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.340]   Maybe it's actually something
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.440]   that happened in someone else's life.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.420]   Maybe it's a youth pastor that you grew up knowing
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.140]   or maybe it was a senior pastor of a church that you loved.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.140]   Or maybe it wasn't that.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.540]   Maybe it wasn't someone that worked for the church.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.880]   Maybe it was someone that you went to church with,
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.740]   a parent or a brother or a sister
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.020]   or a spiritual mentor in your story.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.300]   That man, they loved God so much.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.540]   They loved God more than anybody you had ever known.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.420]   And then they decided to walk away from it all.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.600]   They punted on their faith.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.380]   They denied their devotion.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:20.260]   They went AWOL from everything they once believed.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.180]   And as you have seen them leave it all behind,
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.700]   it's only left you wondering in the process
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.180]   if it wasn't real for them.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.940]   Is it even real at all?
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.520]   That's what's happening to John in this moment.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.920]   He has faithfully lived his life doing the right things,
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.600]   following the right theology, living in the right way.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.280]   He has done everything right.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.320]   But in this moment, he wonders if it's all wrong.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:57.000]   Maybe you're here and you can resonate.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.880]   Your belief is burning out.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.760]   Your spiritual performance is exhausting.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.580]   Your convictions are actually cracking.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.640]   Your faith is growing faint.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.580]   And you get John's question, the brutal honesty,
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.860]   the guttural nature of his question.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.960]   Are you the right guy?
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.680]   He's, I'm not sure anymore.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.440]   It's to that question that Jesus responds
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.300]   because he doesn't want disenchantment
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.740]   to be the end of John's nor your story.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.780]   So he says this.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.720]   And Jesus answered them,
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.780]   "Go and tell John what you hear and see.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.740]   "The blind receive their sight and the lame walk.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.180]   "Lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear,
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.580]   "and the dead are raised up,
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.700]   "and the poor, they have good news preached to them,
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.400]   "and blessed is the one who is not offended by me."
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.580]   Like in response to John's question
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.500]   about Jesus being the Messiah,
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.140]   Jesus answers with a messianic response.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.700]   We won't go through all of the text,
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.340]   and yet what you see is Jesus pulls
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.180]   on four different messianic prophecies
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.820]   from Isaiah 29, 35, 42, and 61,
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.380]   all of which John would have been extremely familiar with
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.780]   because Jesus, he wants to engage John's disappointment
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.660]   and to keep it from becoming disenchantment.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.780]   He wants to speak the most enchanting words.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.620]   It's amazing.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.460]   It's really, it's actually pretty beautiful.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.420]   He's looking at him and he's saying,
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.700]   "Hey man, I know you think I'm not who I say I am,
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.500]   "and yet let me just tell you from the book you believe in
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.460]   "that I am in fact who you want me to be.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.480]   "Like I have done what only the Messiah can do.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.520]   "Like the blind can see, the lame can walk,
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.620]   "like the sick are healed,
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.000]   "the deaf can hear, the dead are raised.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.980]   "I am exactly who you want me to be."
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.920]   You see, Jesus, he does all of this for John
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.120]   and he does it for you and I
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.740]   because he wants you and me to know
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.980]   that Jesus turns rumors into reality.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.820]   Jesus turns rumors into reality.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.640]   You ever felt that?
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.780]   You ever read the Bible and wondered like,
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.180]   "Man, this feels like a joke."
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.460]   Or, "Man, this doesn't feel like a joke.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.640]   "This feels true, but that's definitely not real
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.940]   "in my world."
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.500]   Jesus is like, "Man, all of that biblical rumor, it's real.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.320]   "It's actually biblical reality.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.700]   "And I'm gonna help you find it."
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.380]   That's what Jesus is saying to John.
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.660]   That's what he's saying to us
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.180]   because the Christian life is not a sensible reality at all.
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.860]   It is a spectacular one.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.060]   Like according to the Bible, don't miss this,
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.940]   Christians, they not only believe that God exists,
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.900]   we believe that whole seas split in half,
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.640]   that heaven breaks into the earth,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.420]   that pillars of fire fall from the sky.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.340]   Whoosh, animals, they talk out loud,
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.200]   angelic armies, they appear to protect
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.380]   that the existence of an invisible reality
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.060]   actually does exist,
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.840]   that dragons and giants and demigods are all real,
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.840]   that supernatural gifts are given,
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.440]   not just to the people in this book,
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.880]   but to people like you in these seats.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.840]   We also believe that people speak in languages
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.280]   that they never learned at some point in the past,
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.040]   that the sun itself stood still,
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.740]   that a resurrection from the dead is possible,
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.520]   and there is life everlasting
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.280]   to anyone who believes in Jesus.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.200]   That's what we believe.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.940]   There's nothing sensible about that.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.040]   It is sensational.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.320]   Reality for the Christian is more magical than materialism.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.740]   It's more sensational than your circumstance.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.920]   That's why Jesus says to John,
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.620]   "Hey, everything that you've expected of me, it's true."
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.400]   The blind, they see.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.820]   The lame, they walk.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.980]   The deaf, they hear.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.240]   The sick are healed.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.120]   The dead, they rise.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.920]   Everything you expected is in fact true.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.940]   Do not let your circumstances dictate your judgment,
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.400]   which is a really fair warning for me and for you,
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.340]   because our expectations of Jesus,
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.160]   they can be clouded by our experiences in life.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.220]   Let me say it again.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.840]   In yours, in my expectations,
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.200]   they can be clouded by our experiences in life.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.160]   So think about it this way.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.080]   It's kind of as if the circumstances in your life
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.120]   are like the weather.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:44.800]   Some days, sun's shining, birds are singing,
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.360]   clouds are just floating by.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   You can make shapes of them if you like.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.360]   And Jesus is so very clear.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.000]   He's easy to see, even when you're not close to him,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.940]   when he's across the way,
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.260]   'cause you've not spent a lot of time together
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.240]   as of times recent, and yet you can still see him.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.000]   Yet there are other moments
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.560]   where the circumstances aren't so bright and shining.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:14.800]   Where storm heads roll forward,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.520]   the fog begins to rise,
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.940]   the thunder begins to rumble.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.060]   And Jesus isn't so easy to pick out any longer.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:33.600]   Porch, like the clouds,
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.800]   your circumstances are always moving.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.100]   It may be dark today, it will be bright tomorrow,
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.580]   but that which does not change is Jesus.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:48.040]   He stands with you, he stands for you.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.840]   You need only keep your eyes fixed on him.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.040]   It is possible for two things to be true.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.920]   Life can be hard, and yet God can be good.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.460]   Those two things can be true side by side at the same time.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.920]   Hebrews 13, eight tells us a really simple,
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.360]   but a really profound verse.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.280]   If you're in the business of trying to put things to memory,
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.780]   you should put this to memory,
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.880]   that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.640]   What does that even mean?
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.120]   It means that Jesus never, ever, ever changes.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.560]   His feelings for you, they are the same.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.720]   Yesterday and today and tomorrow.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.700]   Like you may feel shame for something
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.200]   that happened in the past,
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.920]   and yet his forgiveness still reaches for you right now.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.280]   Like you may be struggling against something
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.360]   here in the present, and yet Jesus wants you to know,
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.240]   my strength is sufficient for you today.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.680]   You may be feeling some deep sense of fear
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.500]   about something out in the future,
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.720]   and yet Jesus wants you to know,
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.500]   hey, I stand beside you and we will walk together
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.720]   towards it.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.960]   Like he never changes, and so our expectations of him
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.920]   should not change either,
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.080]   even when our circumstances say differently.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.160]   But Kylan, doesn't he have the power
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.480]   to change my circumstances?
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.560]   Yes!
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.540]   But that doesn't mean he will.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.040]   He absolutely has the power to change your circumstances.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.880]   He has the power to change John's circumstances,
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.040]   yet it does not mean that he will.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.020]   It's actually, it's really interesting.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.860]   If you look at the passage we're studying,
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.240]   the words that Jesus has John's disciples
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.240]   bring back to him, they're full of messianic prophecy,
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.680]   all of which Jesus is the fulfillment of.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:38.760]   And yet Jesus conveniently excludes
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.100]   one element of the prophecy.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.580]   He excludes
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.340]   (pages rustling)
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.380]   liberty of the captives,
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.240]   and the opening of the prison to those who are bound.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:04.980]   He does not, in anything that is so far from ironic,
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.100]   tell John what John wants to hear.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.500]   He has the power to change John's circumstance,
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.120]   but he chooses not to.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.780]   He can absolutely give to John what John wants,
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:23.020]   but he knows what John needs.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.980]   He knows that the best way to deal with disappointment
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.100]   isn't by changing your circumstances
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.940]   to accommodate your faith in God.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.200]   The best way to deal with disappointment
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.020]   is to grow your faith to deal with any and every circumstance
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.580]   that would test you from your God.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.940]   He won't give you what you want.
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.740]   He will give you what you need.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:49.460]   And the beauty of it is, it always leads you nearer to him.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.620]   He wants to keep you close by, near to himself,
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.460]   not dependent or satisfied or contented
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.280]   by anything else in this world.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.760]   No, he wants you to cling to him,
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.220]   not circumstantial comfort.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.860]   That's what he's doing for John.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.300]   That's what he'll do for you.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.980]   As it keeps going in verse seven, it says,
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.580]   "As they went away, Jesus began to speak
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.380]   "to the crowds concerning John.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.900]   "What did you go out into the wilderness to see?
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.400]   "A reed shaken by the wind?
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.080]   "What then did you go out to see?
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.980]   "A man dressed in soft clothing?
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.700]   "Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in king's houses.
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.640]   "What then did you go out to see?
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.120]   "A prophet?
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.560]   "Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.820]   "This is he of whom it is written,
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.900]   "Behold, I will send my messenger before your face
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.300]   "who will prepare your way before you.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.040]   "Truly I say to you, among those born of women,
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.660]   "there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist,
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.620]   "yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.940]   "is greater than he."
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.660]   I love this.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:02.700]   Jesus is not frustrated with John in this moment.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:08.420]   He hears word of John's doubt, even John's disappointment.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.500]   And he's not annoyed by it.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.060]   He looks at the crowds that are listening in
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.040]   and he's like, "Hey, this is my boy, John.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.740]   "There's no one born among women who is greater."
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.860]   That's a high compliment.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.060]   That's a big thing to say.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.620]   He also looks at the crowds and he's like,
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.660]   "What did you go out to see?
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.180]   "A reed shaken in the wind?"
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.380]   John, he's not concerned with public opinion.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.820]   He doesn't care what you think about him.
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.180]   He cares what God thinks about him.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.500]   What, you went out to see if he wore soft clothing?
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.220]   No, like he isn't allured by creature comforts.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.200]   He doesn't need to sit in the halls of power
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.940]   like king's courts because he sits with God.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.580]   John is not concerned with you.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.420]   He does not do what he does
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.760]   by way of the dictation of others.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.380]   He's a prophet.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.540]   He's my prophet.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.580]   He's the greatest among women
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.740]   or the greatest among those born of women.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.620]   Jesus is not in the slightest disappointed with John,
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.780]   which should be wildly encouraging to us
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.340]   because we may grow disappointed in God from time to time,
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.700]   and yet God does not grow disappointed in us.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.460]   God does not magnify your mistakes.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:29.140]   He magnifies his grace.
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.260]   Like he doesn't fixate on your sins.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.660]   He forgives them instead.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.900]   He doesn't emphasize your shortcomings.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:42.180]   He embraces you despite them.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:48.220]   You may be disappointed with God at times,
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.620]   yet he is never disappointed with you.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:56.660]   Romans 8, one, famous verse,
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.580]   which you should preach to yourself daily says,
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.780]   there is therefore now no condemnation
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.300]   for those that are in Christ Jesus,
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.520]   not even a condemnation which you might ascribe
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.220]   as true of yourself.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.420]   There's none.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.580]   You can self-condemn, but it is not what God condemns
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.820]   because we know for the law,
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.140]   the spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.660]   from the law of sin and death.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.820]   Now, let me be abundantly clear.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.500]   This does not mean that we should overlook our sin.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.220]   Doesn't mean that we should pacify our depravity.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.620]   We should leverage grace like a license
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.840]   or hall pass to do whatever we want.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.580]   That's not what this is saying.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.460]   And yet what it is saying is that though we may feel
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.940]   despondent in life and disappointed in God,
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.020]   we do not run from him.
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.100]   We run towards him.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:51.180]   Because when there was good reason
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.980]   to be disappointed in you,
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.900]   he did not run from you.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.620]   He ran to you.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.780]   He came after you through hell and high water.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:05.500]   He made quick haste to get to those whom he loved,
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.060]   though there was nothing lovable about them.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.700]   This is who our God is.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.940]   He's not disappointed with you.
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.740]   He's wildly crazy about you.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.340]   And yet it's not because of something that we've done,
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.740]   nor we've earned, nor we've merited,
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.100]   but simply because he chooses to lavish love.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.100]   He welcomes your questions.
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.140]   He's not afraid of your doubts.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.540]   He's not offended by your frustrations with him.
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.140]   Eugene Peterson says,
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.760]   "The reason many of us do not ardently believe
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.500]   "in the gospel is that we've never given it
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.460]   "a rigorous testing.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.820]   "We've never thrown our hard questions at it.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.060]   "Face it with our most prickly doubt."
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.660]   What's Eugene saying?
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.580]   True faith does not walk out on Jesus
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.380]   when he fails to meet our expectations.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:59.000]   It leans into Jesus that he might help you sort it out.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.380]   And the reason for that is because there is no road
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.140]   to maturity without disappointment.
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:10.260]   There's no road to maturity without disappointment.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.940]   There was no one like John B, okay?
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.980]   Like he was the greatest born among women,
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.900]   and yet what we know is that John's maturity
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.180]   was not the result of an absence of disappointment,
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.360]   but the presence of it.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.320]   How do you grow in maturity?
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:33.260]   Not by age, not by intelligence.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.160]   You grow through experience.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.600]   Don't miss this.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.000]   Especially those experiences
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.880]   which do not meet your expectations.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:50.340]   Those experiences which lead to your disappointment.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.040]   That's why you can't just apply
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.840]   for whatever job you want in life.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.380]   Some of you are in the job hunt right now,
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.300]   and yet what you need to know
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.080]   is that some positions require experience.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.580]   Because at some point,
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.840]   as you ascend into the heights of hierarchical power
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.880]   within corporate America,
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.240]   it doesn't matter how many degrees you have,
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.060]   it doesn't matter how many letters are after your name,
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.880]   or how many books nor knowledge you know,
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.600]   what matters are the problems you've solved,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.760]   the issues you've addressed,
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.720]   the challenges you've faced.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.640]   You need experience,
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:30.160]   which is not learned, but lived.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:36.760]   You and I, if we want to grow,
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.200]   particularly into godliness,
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.560]   we need to live through some disappointment.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.800]   We need to be willing to undergo some adversity.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.920]   Now, let me just say, in a room this size,
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.640]   I'm not too naive to know
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.960]   that the amount of disappointment felt is deep,
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.560]   and the source of that disappointment is broad.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.520]   But I'm also not too naive to know
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.560]   that God is working through those disappointments
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.400]   for your good.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.640]   Like, some of you are so disappointed
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.720]   that your walk with God doesn't feel sensational.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.960]   It feels sensible.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.600]   But what you need to know is that God is at work.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.080]   Like, God is stirring up in you a holy discontent
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.400]   to break you out of your sensibilities.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.400]   He wants you to wrestle and question and struggle
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.160]   and wonder for more of him.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.880]   This has been my reality for the last two years.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.680]   I'll just level with you, porch.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.680]   I don't want to play the Christian game.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.720]   I don't want to stand on stage and look the part.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.240]   I don't want to say the right things
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.600]   yet not actually mean them.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.180]   I don't want to read this book and know it's true
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.180]   yet not actually believe it.
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.560]   I want this to be real.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.720]   Like, I want this book and the lessons I've learned
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.640]   and the lives I've seen to be real in my own experience.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.320]   I pray every single day,
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.400]   God, would you be real to me?
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.200]   Would you be real to me?
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.860]   Would you be real to me, God?
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.200]   I don't just want to live in a world full of rumor.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.040]   I want to live into the kind of reality
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.080]   that you've come to bring.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.880]   Help me, God.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.680]   Unlock me from these sensible ways
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.760]   and unleash me, God, into a spectacular life.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.080]   And by his grace, he's doing it.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.840]   If he'll do it for me, he will do it for you.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.480]   I promise you he will.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.000]   Not because you earned it, man, you deserve it.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:46.840]   You know what?
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.800]   You look like you actually could use it.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.360]   No, he will do it just simply because he cares
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.440]   for you to know him as he is.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.240]   Does anybody want that?
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.880]   It's available.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.860]   It's available.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:07.200]   Some of you are disappointed that you know what's true,
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.840]   you just don't feel what's true.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.740]   But God's at work.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.260]   Like, he's renewing your mind beyond sterile knowledge
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.800]   in leading you into a beautiful and bold belief.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.920]   Like, here's the thing.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.920]   Maybe instead of just doing Christianity the right way,
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.320]   you should do it in the way that works for you.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.760]   Maybe you should read your Bible at night.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.040]   Maybe you should read through your journal.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.760]   You should draw in your journal.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   Like, maybe you should read books.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.160]   You should listen to audio books.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.800]   But man, that's not as spiritual as those guys
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.360]   that sit down, they just read book after book
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.200]   after book after book.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.120]   Who cares?
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.700]   Like, the right way of doing things is the way
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:48.700]   that leads you to love Jesus as revealed by his word more.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.460]   So do that.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.180]   My goal every day is to end the day and love Jesus more
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:57.600]   than I did at the beginning of it.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   I will relentlessly pursue that in my life.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.160]   And I am giving you permission to do the same.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.940]   Some of you were disappointed that God hasn't answered
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.820]   that prayer that you've been praying.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.380]   But listen, man, he is at work.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.820]   He is inviting you not just to trust in him,
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.500]   but to process with him, to plead with him,
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.400]   to implore him, to not pull your punches,
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.900]   to maybe forget your manners when you pray to him.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.320]   Maybe to yell.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.080]   God had no issue with those that grumbled to him.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.540]   He took issue with people that grumbled about it,
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.860]   but wouldn't actually come and talk to him about it.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.260]   He can handle your problems.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.280]   He already knows.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.060]   It's not secret.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.900]   He's very clearly aware of what's going on in here.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.700]   So why don't you tell him about it?
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.060]   He's already aware.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:51.900]   And the beauty of it is,
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.020]   is he actually wants to listen to you.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.620]   Isaiah 62, 6, 7, it's amazing.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.620]   It says, "On your walls, O Jerusalem,
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.980]   I have set watchmen all day and all night.
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.140]   They shall never be silent.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.160]   You who put the Lord in remembrance, take no rest.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.940]   Give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.660]   and makes it a praise in the earth."
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.700]   What's that saying?
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.740]   God is saying, "Don't quit asking me.
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.100]   Don't quit talking to me.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.540]   Don't quit processing with me.
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.620]   Don't quit praying to me.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.240]   Don't quit pleading with me.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.140]   Give me no rest.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.580]   Be in constant, incessant annoyance in my life
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.940]   because I love you and I want to hear from you."
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.440]   Some of you are disappointed that God hasn't given you
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.460]   what you really and rightly have wanted.
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:43.180]   A husband, a wife, a job,
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:50.260]   some opportunity, rest, healing, friends.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.940]   You have rightly wanted and you have patiently waited.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.780]   But God's at work.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:05.700]   He's calling you to wait with him, not just on him.
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.620]   Not just on him.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:18.380]   He would be glad to let you wait longer
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:23.140]   if it brings you closer
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.680]   because he cares about you that much.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.780]   Some of you have waited for so long.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   To God, a day is, a year is but a day.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.860]   Time is so very far outside of him.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.940]   If it feels like it's taking long,
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:48.000]   it's because he wants longer with you.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.280]   Maybe instead of waiting on him,
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.780]   you just need to wait with him.
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.960]   God does not waste disappointment.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.020]   He wants to use it.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.060]   Last story.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:06.540]   In 1951, shortly after relocating his family to Switzerland,
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.460]   Francis Schaeffer, a theologian and an apologist
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.900]   who defended the Christian faith
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.820]   following the post-war era,
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.140]   he underwent the most influential faith crisis of his life.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:22.780]   Today, we know that his crisis
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.940]   was known as the Hayloft experience
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.780]   where for three months,
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.140]   he plunged into the darkness
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.140]   of his own personal deconstruction
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.660]   and paced the Hayloft of his Swiss chalet
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.100]   seeking answers about God.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:40.780]   You see, Francis had been one of the lead members
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.740]   in a brand new evangelical movement,
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:47.500]   one that was zealous for theological precision
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:51.380]   and ecclesiological correctness,
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.940]   and yet as he spent time amongst this movement
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.340]   and they began to build momentum,
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.860]   he grew disappointed
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.980]   in the fact that they were zealous
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.980]   for all manner of other things
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.060]   except loving their neighbors.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.620]   And so it was out of this movement,
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.300]   frustrated by the fact that people
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.380]   were more focused on serving Jesus
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.600]   than actually enjoying Jesus,
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.140]   that he took an existential hiatus
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.820]   and he sought after God
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.860]   and he set himself to answer this question
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.060]   as quoted by him,
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.900]   if so many zealous Christians
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.940]   were lacking the reality central to Christianity,
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.860]   is Christianity itself even real?
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:47.180]   As he recalls, he had known that,
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.740]   he had to know that Christianity was real,
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.300]   that one could experience a true sense of God's presence
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.420]   and that the scriptures were in fact
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.900]   God's revelation to man.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.500]   And he committed that if by the end of his questioning,
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.980]   he couldn't emerge from his hayloft
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.460]   with a deep sense of the reality of it all,
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.060]   then he would altogether abandon the faith forever.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:12.060]   By the end of those three months,
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.700]   pacing back and forth in his Swiss chalet,
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.220]   Francis emerged
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:24.700]   and what was once an existential crisis
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.780]   was replaced by existential bliss
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.500]   as he learned,
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.500]   my God is real,
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.420]   his word is true
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.860]   and he does save.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.940]   I will go to him,
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.620]   I will be with him
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.940]   and I will be his forever.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:48.660]   Francis made a commitment in conviction,
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:53.580]   believing all these things are actual reality,
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:58.300]   stepping further into the experience that God was inviting
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.780]   and because he did,
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.020]   his life changed,
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.620]   his family's life changed
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.340]   and the entire world changed
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.820]   to the point that we're standing in a room
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.460]   with several thousand young adults
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.820]   talking about it right now.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:14.940]   Friend, are you disappointed with God?
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:22.380]   Perhaps your experience does not meet your expectation
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:26.980]   because Jesus is calling you to a new experience
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.180]   that you know not even to expect.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.060]   That's what the gospel promises.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.660]   The gospel is a message of God liberating us
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.820]   out of the disappointment of our status,
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.540]   lost in sin,
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.940]   estranged from God,
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.500]   enemies to one another
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.260]   and hating our brother
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:54.620]   and yet Jesus came to solve the disappointment in our life.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:58.500]   All the fulfillment we sought,
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.340]   yet could never find,
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.340]   he came to give.
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.060]   All the purpose we longed for,
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.980]   yet could never find,
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.260]   he came to offer.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.180]   All the hope that we wanted,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.420]   yet could never attain,
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:12.700]   he came to bestow.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.020]   You see, Jesus,
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.420]   he came to enchant the disenchanted.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.460]   (gentle music)
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.460]   Son of God,
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.580]   enthroned in glory,
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.580]   become son of man,
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.100]   down here with the lowly
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.340]   because he wanted to take you,
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.780]   a disenchanted poor soul
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.500]   and enchant you
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.620]   into the experience of a son and daughter of God.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:46.100]   Jesus came to turn a rumor into reality.
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:50.460]   Rumor has it that we had no hope,
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:55.700]   yet Jesus knew he could change that story
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.540]   by living the life we could not,
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.660]   dying the death we deserve,
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.100]   being buried in our place,
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.780]   yet rising forth from the grave
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.460]   to replace the rumor of your eternal condemnation
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.500]   with one of everlasting life.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.860]   And Jesus came to mature the immature,
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.220]   not apart from our disappointment,
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:20.100]   but by bearing our disappointment,
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.340]   the disappointment of our sin in himself.
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:27.580]   There's an experience of God that will never disappoint
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:33.380]   because that experience of God has a name
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.460]   and his name is Christ,
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:36.980]   Jesus Christ.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.780]   He's come to seek the lost.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.660]   He's come to save.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.820]   He's come to save the dead,
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.340]   liberate the captive
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:54.340]   and give you the enjoyment
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:59.180]   you so very much long for in this life.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.300]   Do you believe it's true?
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.140]   Because it quite in fact is.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.020]   Let me pray you would.
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.020]   God, we love you.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.660]   Oh God, I pray
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.060]   that you and I,
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:18.460]   we have talked about this so much,
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:27.540]   that God, I want the porch
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:32.820]   to be a place
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:37.100]   of experiential spirituality
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:42.100]   where everything we read is true.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:46.140]   We would realize as true in our own lives
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:50.020]   that God, we would know
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:54.460]   your presence isn't just something we study about.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.180]   It isn't just something we know about.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.260]   Your presence is here
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:03.700]   and we get to be loved by you.
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:08.340]   Oh God, I pray that you would pierce
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:14.060]   whatever barriers exist within this room
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.860]   and over our hearts, God,
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.860]   and you would liberate us from sterile Christianity,
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.820]   boring spirituality,
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.540]   and you would lead us, God, into an experience,
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.460]   not an emotional experience,
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.820]   but God, a real and genuine experience of you
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.900]   that leads us, God, to claim this must be true.
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.300]   There's no other explanation
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.580]   than the fact that God is who he says he is,
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.900]   that Jesus Christ has come to save
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.260]   and he has in fact saved me.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.420]   I pray, God, that even in this next moment,
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.260]   we would stand to our feet,
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.220]   we would not rush from this room,
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.020]   and we would sing to you,
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:03.740]   not at you, but to you.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.660]   We would pray to you,
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.460]   not at you, but to you.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.380]   And God, we would hear from you
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:18.660]   because one word from you can change a person forever.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.900]   We love you.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.100]   And it is in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.900]   Hey, porch, let's stand to our feet.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:30.580]   Everything we just talked about, we are about to do.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.100]   We have worshiped, we have taught,
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:40.100]   and now we're going to experience the goodness of God.
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.740]   We're gonna declare to him
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:46.020]   that he and he alone is worthy of our pursuit.
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.300]   So let's sing to him now.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.340]   If you need to pray with people,
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.300]   we've got folks down, the stage left, stage right,
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.820]   they'd love to engage with you.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.620]   The time is yours, the king is here.
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.980]   Let's sing to him together.
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:05.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
