1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,480
 - Let's go, let's go!

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,940
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,320
 Hey, it is good to be back,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,160
 speaking at the porch with all of you.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,400
 You guys are my favorite.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,120
 I'm so excited to be here.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,080
 Hey, I wanna give a quick shout out to our friends,

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,840
 our live locations, tuning in online.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,160
 We have Porch Houston, Porch Sweetwater,

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,300
 Porch Missouri City, and Porch Cedar Rapids.

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,760
 And of course, a big hello to my friends in the room

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,280
 tonight here in Dallas, Texas.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,620
 So, hey, if we haven't met, my name is JD,

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,040
 and I am so excited.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,400
 We're gonna get right in because I got 30 minutes.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,800
 I got in trouble last time for going too long,

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,000
 so we're gonna stick to 30 minutes.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,440
 So here we go.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,840
 Sophomore year of high school, there I am, my brother,

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,400
 my little brother, who you need to know

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
 is a lot bigger than me.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,080
 A lot of things happened, and the point is,

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,600
 a very brother-on-brother situation happened

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,180
 where I had the remote, he wanted the remote,

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,040
 he's here tonight, he wanted the remote,

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,600
 and he came over to me with his manly self,

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
 and at this point, I'm like this tall,

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,400
 and he walks over and says, "Give me the remote."

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,880
 And I'm like, "No."

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,320
 And he's like, "Give me the remote."

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,340
 And he starts to do that thing

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,080
 where you start to bend back someone's finger,

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,160
 and I'm like, "Uh-uh, uh-uh."

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,760
 And he's like, "Let go of the remote."

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,740
 And I look at him, and I say,

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,160
 "You are not gonna get this remote

38
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,800
 "unless you don't have to break my finger.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,480
 "If you want this remote, you're gonna break my finger."

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,680
 And he looks down at me, right in the eye,

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,440
 and he just goes, (imitates gun firing)

42
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,360
 (congregation laughing)

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,580
 And I pull away, and I'm like,

44
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,320
 "Oh, take your stupid remote."

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,880
 And I throw it, and I walk in my room,

46
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,680
 and I look down, and I could not believe it.

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,080
 My finger is facing this way.

48
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
 He literally broke my finger.

49
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,680
 And I walk in, and I'm like, "Oh, my God."

50
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,760
 He's like, "Ah!"

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,720
 We're like, "Ah!"

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,160
 And I run into my mom, and we're like, "Ah!"

53
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,600
 And she's like, "Oh, ah!"

54
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,280
 We all just, she's like, "Get in the car.

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,120
 "Get in the car."

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,000
 My brother's like, "Can I come?"

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
 And she's like, "No, you've done enough."

58
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,000
 And we get in the car, and we get to the hospital,

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,160
 and I'm thinking I'm gonna walk out of there

60
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,440
 with one of these guys.

61
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,820
 Everyone ever had those finger splint things?

62
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,240
 Because of the nature of the break,

63
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,360
 I had a cast to my elbow.

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,720
 Imagine walking to high school,

65
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,760
 into high school the next day,

66
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,560
 and all your friends are like, "What'd you do?

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,640
 "How'd you break your arm?"

68
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,840
 And I'm like, "My little brother

69
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,240
 "literally broke my finger with his man hands."

70
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,160
 That's what I had to tell people,

71
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,580
 and it was embarrassing, humiliating.

72
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,400
 And I had to walk around with a big old cast for six weeks.

73
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,640
 And six weeks came, and the doctor said,

74
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,520
 "Hey, now you have to do the hard part."

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,840
 That was the easy part.

76
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,600
 "Now you have to do physical therapy.

77
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,760
 "And if anyone's had physical therapy, no one likes it.

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,320
 "Especially when it's your little finger.

79
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
 "One and two and one and."

80
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
 It's just not fun, and it's painful.

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,180
 And so what did I do?

82
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,560
 I was a drummer, I liked volleyball, I was very active,

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,280
 and so I wanted to get back in the game as soon as I could,

84
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,960
 so I would just pop the pain meds,

85
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,680
 deal with the little bit of temporary pain,

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,840
 get back in the game.

87
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,000
 And I never really actually did physical therapy,

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,920
 and because of that, my finger can't function

89
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,760
 how it's supposed to.

90
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,940
 I literally cannot bend it in.

91
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,880
 There is too much cartilage built up

92
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,720
 because I did not do physical therapy.

93
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,960
 This is how it's supposed to be.

94
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,280
 This is how it is.

95
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,440
 My finger will never ever be able to fully function

96
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,000
 the way that it was intended to,

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,880
 because I was not willing to put in the work for a season,

98
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,040
 although painful, I wasn't willing to do it.

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,860
 I just ignored it.

100
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,960
 I didn't address it, and now my finger won't bend.

101
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,640
 And I start there because in a lot of the same ways,

102
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,380
 you and I know that we're broken.

103
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,900
 We know that we're messed up.

104
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,720
 We know there are things that have happened in our life

105
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,620
 that require maybe a spiritual therapy,

106
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,540
 that require us to step into a season

107
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,980
 of maybe short, temporary pain, because let's be real,

108
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,780
 it's hard to address really broken things,

109
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,460
 and instead of using our decade of decisions

110
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,600
 to decide to actually deal with these things,

111
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,340
 we actually turn to numbing and coping mechanisms,

112
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,500
 and that's what I wanna talk about tonight.

113
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,300
 I wanna talk about tonight how you need to make sure

114
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,300
 that this next decade is defined by you taking the time

115
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,180
 to experience spiritual therapy now, not later,

116
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,780
 because that is what your young adult year

117
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,080
 should build upon, is you taking the time to get healthy,

118
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,260
 to get healed, and to get free.

119
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,300
 But so many of us waste our young adult years,

120
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,900
 and we turn to things to numb the pain

121
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,660
 and to cope with things, to get through a season,

122
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,660
 and we walk and we limp the rest of our life

123
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,020
 because we never dealt with our pain.

124
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,220
 We never dealt with it.

125
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,060
 And so I'm gonna talk about tonight God's plan,

126
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,840
 because so many of us are walking around,

127
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,300
 dealing with things like depression, fear and anxiety,

128
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,140
 insecurity, guilt and shame, disappointment, loneliness,

129
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,740
 all of these things make us so broken

130
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,080
 and leave us with so many questions,

131
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,200
 because the world we live in is broken.

132
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,260
 Can we just be real for a moment and acknowledge

133
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,160
 that we live in a very messed up time?

134
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,740
 The world is crazy.

135
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,260
 I don't even know anything about politics

136
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,040
 to know that the world is crazy, okay?

137
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,180
 You can see it everywhere.

138
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,100
 And what I have come to realize though,

139
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,700
 is that because being a young adult,

140
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,220
 no one really gives you a manual.

141
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,860
 Like college needs to work on teaching you actual things

142
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,820
 that are applicable to life.

143
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,800
 Can I get an amen?

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,300
 Like you get done, like you get the piece of paper

145
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,700
 and you get chunked into society,

146
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,820
 like a little, like the world is savage

147
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,020
 and you just get chunked out there with no manual.

148
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,740
 And they just expect you to know how to do things,

149
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,080
 how to pay for taxes, how to get your debt covered

150
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,300
 and to defend for yourself.

151
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,420
 It's a lonely, lonely place.

152
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,420
 And because of that, we search to find any kind of escape

153
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,260
 through avenues like numbing and coping mechanisms.

154
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,100
 So that's what we're talking about tonight.

155
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,520
 Tonight, I wanna talk about how we can stop numbing

156
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,440
 and start healing.

157
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,020
 That we can use our roaring 20s,

158
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,140
 that we can use this decade

159
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,240
 as we're deciding to do so many things

160
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,480
 to make the time to put in the necessary work,

161
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,400
 although painful for a short season to actually heal

162
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,720
 so we can function how God always intended

163
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,440
 for you and I to function.

164
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,480
 He did not intend for us to walk around with a limp

165
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,680
 and live life partial.

166
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,300
 He meant for life to be full.

167
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,280
 And God has something to say about how we're meant to live

168
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,020
 and how we're meant to heal.

169
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,120
 And so just a quick preview,

170
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,040
 tonight we're talking about three steps

171
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,920
 to stop numbing and start healing.

172
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,840
 Three steps to stop numbing and start healing.

173
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,680
 I want you to remember these.

174
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,960
 I made them really easy for the note takers in the room.

175
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,960
 Three A's, A, A, A, admit, allow, address.

176
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,600
 Admit, allow, address.

177
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,480
 Say it with me.

178
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,340
 Admit, allow, address.

179
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,080
 Because what you don't want to happen is

180
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,160
 you don't wanna keep turning to coping

181
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,440
 because one day you're gonna wake up

182
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,880
 and realize that it's too late.

183
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
 You're now that weird 40 year old man at the bar

184
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
 by himself reminiscing on the glory days

185
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,620
 with guys who don't care.

186
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,280
 You don't wanna be that mom

187
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,320
 that is wearing inappropriate clothes

188
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,080
 and it's like, you're like, oh, please cover that up

189
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,060
 because she's trying to get some attraction

190
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,900
 from younger guys.

191
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,040
 You just don't wanna be that person.

192
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,560
 And those people became those people

193
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,880
 because they never dealt with their pain

194
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,000
 in their young adult years.

195
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,320
 You don't want that to be your story.

196
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,600
 And God has a better story for us.

197
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,660
 So let's talk about it.

198
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,960
 The first step and how to stop numbing and start healing

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,800
 is to admit that you're numbing.

200
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,940
 Admit that you're numbing.

201
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,560
 It's not really rocket science.

202
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,600
 A lot of us, we have not been able to find a way

203
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,760
 to stop numbing is because we haven't even admitted

204
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,760
 to ourselves that, hey, I think I'm numbing.

205
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,280
 And I don't wanna assume that everyone here

206
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,360
 knows what I mean when I say numbing or coping.

207
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,920
 So here's just some examples really quick.

208
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,780
 You might be numbing or coping

209
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,320
 if you can't wait to get home from work

210
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,840
 to drink that glass of wine every single day.

211
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,440
 Your credit cards are maxed out

212
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,120
 and somehow you're still managing

213
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,560
 to buy that drink every single weekend.

214
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,960
 You work out again and again and again,

215
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,580
 and you're so anal about everything you eat

216
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,360
 because you think, man, if I just looked like so-and-so.

217
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,840
 Just a quick list of other things.

218
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,480
 You might be buying things that you know you don't need.

219
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,000
 You might be actually going through cutting.

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,860
 People literally, I mean, I know

221
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,680
 that you can get to such a place that you're like,

222
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,920
 I just wanna feel something.

223
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,640
 So you resort to self-harm.

224
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,320
 And I don't mean for this to be light.

225
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,320
 I don't mean for this to be just a quick thing on a list.

226
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,000
 This is serious stuff that we're talking about.

227
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,200
 And there's a way out of these things.

228
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,160
 You might be numbing with pornography,

229
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,280
 popping constantly Xanax, Adderall,

230
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,080
 hitting a quick blunt every morning,

231
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,840
 eating disorders, Instagram,

232
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,520
 getting drunk and living for the weekend,

233
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,040
 having sex, zoning out.

234
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,600
 Literally, like if your life has zero silence in it,

235
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,880
 if you can't stand being alone,

236
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,680
 so every time you're alone at a red light,

237
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,880
 at a stop sign even, you're just checking your phone

238
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
 or you're playing video games for hours,

239
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,680
 anything to allow you to zone out, that is numbing.

240
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,520
 That is coping because you're not wanting to face reality.

241
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,180
 And so some of you, to be able to admit that you're numbing,

242
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,020
 you first have to come to grips

243
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,880
 with understanding what numbing is.

244
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,360
 And then if you do anything kind of in this wheelhouse,

245
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
 anything that you look to as an escape to avoid reality,

246
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,920
 you're numbing.

247
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,160
 Others of you are like, yeah,

248
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
 I know this stuff isn't good for me.

249
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,000
 I know this stuff isn't what I'm supposed to be doing,

250
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,160
 especially if I call myself a Christian.

251
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,720
 I know these things aren't right,

252
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,720
 but my pride will not let me admit that I'm numbing

253
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,080
 or that I'm coping.

254
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,960
 Here's why.

255
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,440
 You don't wanna admit that you're numbing

256
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,240
 because you know that that actually means

257
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
 that you will have to admit that something is wrong

258
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,840
 because no one just numbs for the sake of numbing.

259
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,160
 If you don't wanna admit that you're numbing or like,

260
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
 yeah, I know these things aren't good for me,

261
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,720
 but I'm not gonna admit it.

262
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,900
 I'm good, I'm just having fun.

263
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,640
 Or this is just what you do when you're young.

264
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,700
 Like if you're so afraid to admit it,

265
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,400
 it's because you're so afraid to admit that you're weak

266
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,900
 and that you have a need.

267
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,200
 You would rather, actually we would rather,

268
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,880
 as a generation laugh about these things.

269
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,480
 Literally, I was just looking up all the things

270
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,760
 about numbing and coping

271
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,640
 and what something actually triggered in my mind

272
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,320
 was these really popular memes

273
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
 that people kind of made around this topic.

274
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,880
 So this first one, therapists, remember these?

275
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,560
 And what do we say when we feel like this?

276
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
 More espresso, less depresso.

277
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,980
 Therapists, no.

278
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,800
 Next one.

279
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,840
 What's your unhealthiest coping mechanism?

280
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,560
 Listening to depressing songs when I'm depressed

281
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,640
 to increase my depression.

282
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,080
 Anyone been there before?

283
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,960
 You're like, I don't know why I'm listening to this.

284
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,800
 I don't know why I'm doing it.

285
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,640
 I know I shouldn't.

286
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,320
 And it's like, we just do it.

287
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,720
 The next one.

288
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,960
 Therapists, and what do we do when we feel like this?

289
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,040
 Redownload Tinder to feel validated by strangers.

290
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,000
 No, no, this explains a lot.

291
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,940
 We are not, this isn't new information to most of us.

292
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,120
 We know it so well.

293
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,840
 We know that we do these things.

294
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,720
 We are so aware of it that we literally make memes about it.

295
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,120
 We literally are like, yep, this is me.

296
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,780
 I mean, I know coping mechanisms.

297
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,620
 I'm the guy, I mean, that's just me.

298
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,000
 And I would say to you, although we can laugh

299
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,480
 and although we can joke, how long?

300
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,120
 Like how long are we gonna laugh at the fact

301
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,080
 that there are people in our generation,

302
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,400
 there are people our age who are coping

303
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,840
 because they're searching.

304
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,240
 And wisdom would say that you can laugh

305
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,000
 and you can reject and you can dismiss the idea

306
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,400
 that you're numbing and you can be prideful

307
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,480
 all you want, but it will only lead you to more hurt.

308
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,160
 Proverbs 16, 18 says, "Pride goes before destruction

309
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,060
 "and a haughty or arrogant spirit before a fall."

310
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,960
 Pride comes before the fall.

311
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,180
 Literally, if you keep this up,

312
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,600
 it'll only last you for so long.

313
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,760
 If you're someone that's going, that's not me, man.

314
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,040
 Like you don't know me, you don't know why I do

315
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,440
 the things I do, you just need to chill out.

316
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,040
 I would say really check yourself

317
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,480
 because I would say that it looks like you're going

318
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,480
 down a path that leads to destruction.

319
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,920
 It's only gonna end up bad for you.

320
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,480
 And the thing about being a Christ follower,

321
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,580
 that's so cool about being a son and daughter

322
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,080
 that I've come to realize is I used to like be this guy

323
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,400
 that didn't wanna admit that I was actually

324
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,240
 dealing with things.

325
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,040
 And so when I started to read the Bible,

326
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,280
 I started to see that Paul actually tells us

327
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,620
 in 2 Corinthians 12, nine, he says,

328
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,320
 "My grace is sufficient for you."

329
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,560
 So that's what God says to us.

330
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,120
 "My grace is sufficient for you,

331
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,880
 for my power is made perfect in weakness.

332
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,000
 Therefore, we can boast all the more gladly

333
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,440
 in our weaknesses so that the power of Christ

334
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,800
 may rest upon us."

335
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,320
 Here's what Paul is saying there.

336
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,700
 Your weakness needs to be on full display

337
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,160
 because when you're weak, that's when the world gets to see

338
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,840
 just how strong he is.

339
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,280
 And so the best thing you can do is quit trying

340
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,180
 to put up this image that I'm all good.

341
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,840
 I'm not numbing, I just like to have fun.

342
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,920
 It's just the things that I do.

343
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,520
 No, I'm weak.

344
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,660
 I have a problem and I need Jesus.

345
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,300
 So for some of us, the most courageous thing we can do,

346
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,280
 listen, the most courageous practical next step

347
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,280
 that you can take is to go and be alone as soon as you can

348
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,080
 or look yourself in a mirror or get in your car

349
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,200
 and put your hands on the driver's, the steering wheel

350
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,420
 and say to yourself, things that you have suppressed

351
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,740
 and denied for so long that you know are there.

352
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,400
 Some of you might need to say things like,

353
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,320
 I don't like myself.

354
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,640
 I really just actually struggle with self-loathing

355
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,160
 and I don't like what I see when I look in the mirror.

356
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,680
 Some of you need to say, I blame God that I'm still single.

357
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,720
 Some of you should say, I think my dad will genuinely

358
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,280
 never be proud of me and give me that attaboy

359
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,520
 like I've craved for my whole life

360
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,420
 until I'm actually really successful.

361
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,460
 Or maybe it's, I don't actually know where I'm going

362
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,300
 when I die.

363
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,740
 If I were to get in a car wreck on the way home,

364
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,040
 there's something that keeps playing in the back of my mind

365
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,540
 that I don't know what's next, therefore I escape

366
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,300
 because I don't wanna think about that, that scares me.

367
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,380
 And so step one is admit that you're numbing

368
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,260
 because that is the first step to admit

369
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,720
 that there is a deeper problem going on, that you're weak.

370
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,340
 But when you start to do this, I don't want you to think

371
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,820
 that, oh, I admitted it, it's out there,

372
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,980
 things are gonna get easier.

373
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,860
 I would actually argue, now it gets harder

374
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,700
 for a little bit.

375
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,140
 It's actually gonna get tougher when you start

376
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,240
 to admit these things because these are feelings

377
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,860
 and thoughts and lies that you've suppressed for so long.

378
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,460
 And when you begin to speak them and say them,

379
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,380
 you start to have all these feelings and emotions,

380
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,300
 especially for you men that aren't used to expressing

381
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,420
 feelings and emotions.

382
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,940
 Obviously I'm a very hyper emotional guy more than most,

383
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,660
 but when you do it, it starts to come out of you,

384
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,540
 rush out of you and you start to feel things

385
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,500
 you never felt before and you start to go,

386
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,020
 wait, this is really hard.

387
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,700
 I don't know what to do with all this.

388
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,780
 And you begin to go, what do I do?

389
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,080
 I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out,

390
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,340
 which then leads to the perfect setup for step two.

391
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,200
 Step two is allow others in.

392
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,400
 Allow others in.

393
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,060
 God never intended for us to do this life alone.

394
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,700
 He never wanted you to deal with these things in isolation.

395
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,020
 He saw from the very beginning that it was not good

396
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,300
 for man to be alone.

397
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,140
 So what did he do?

398
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:38,980
 He gave him woman.

399
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,420
 God made us in his image.

400
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
 He is three in one.

401
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,640
 He literally exists in togetherness.

402
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,460
 You and I, we crave and we desire to be known

403
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,080
 and to be with other people.

404
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,340
 So stop trying to carry these things alone.

405
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,220
 Stop trying to do life alone.

406
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,260
 It's so much better when you do life together with people.

407
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,820
 And here's why.

408
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,420
 You're searching for healing.

409
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,940
 You're searching to get away from these problems

410
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,780
 that you're running from.

411
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,020
 You're searching for true freedom.

412
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,340
 Here's what I've come to find

413
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,580
 in the past like eight months.

414
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,020
 What I've come to find is healing requires revealing.

415
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,600
 Healing requires revealing.

416
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,440
 Why?

417
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,260
 I'll tell you why.

418
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,140
 Literally, God says so.

419
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,420
 James 5, 16, "Confess your sins to one another."

420
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,260
 Why?

421
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,700
 "So that you may be healed."

422
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,220
 We're all looking for prescriptions and medications

423
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,060
 and drugs and alcohol and anything,

424
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,780
 girls, relationships, marriage, kids, success,

425
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,620
 so many things to provide healing and freedom

426
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,780
 from all the things we're running from.

427
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,860
 And he's saying right here,

428
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,860
 "Confess your sins to one another."

429
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,680
 Why?

430
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,020
 "So that you may be healed."

431
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,860
 Allowing others in when these things

432
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,500
 that you've admitted are surfacing

433
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,980
 allows you to share that burden

434
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,580
 and God has built up people to carry it with you.

435
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,960
 Proverbs 18, one says,

436
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,580
 "Whoever isolates himself, seeks his own desires,

437
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,260
 "he breaks out against all sound judgment."

438
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,560
 Proverbs 28, 13 says,

439
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,140
 "Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,

440
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,060
 "but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy."

441
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,940
 So if scripture is constantly pointing us

442
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,520
 to allowing other people in, why do we forsake it?

443
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,940
 Why are we so quick to withdraw and be like,

444
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,480
 "No, I got this, I got this, look, I got this, I'm fine."

445
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,460
 Everyone see, on Instagram, look at me, I'm fine.

446
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,420
 Like we do all these things

447
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,180
 to make the world convinced that we're fine

448
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,740
 and we know we're not.

449
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,860
 Why is that?

450
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,300
 Maybe it's 'cause we're embarrassed.

451
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,880
 Maybe it's 'cause we think I'm too much, this is too much.

452
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,080
 Like, man, I'm too far into this friendship

453
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,620
 and if I start to just randomly start to like,

454
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,160
 let out all these feelings and like my past,

455
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,500
 they're gonna run.

456
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,660
 I don't wanna be alone.

457
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,200
 Maybe you think like, man, if I tell them,

458
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,400
 it'll change everything they think about me.

459
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,060
 And I would just tell you from personal experience,

460
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,020
 that's not true.

461
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,060
 What you wanna look for is people

462
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,700
 that when you start to tell them your stuff,

463
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,380
 they will actually lean in, not run away, not pull back.

464
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,620
 And here's what they're gonna be able to help you to do.

465
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,980
 They're gonna be able to help you separate truth from lies.

466
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,920
 They're gonna be able to help you decide next steps

467
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,780
 and plans for actions and not only just help you decide it,

468
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,340
 but keep you accountable to it.

469
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,380
 They're gonna be able to put healthy parameters

470
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,060
 and boundaries in your life to say,

471
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,820
 hey, I don't think that's a good idea.

472
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,100
 Hey, I don't think that relationship is best for you.

473
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,060
 I don't think you drinking this much is God's best for you.

474
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,340
 But ultimately, they're gonna just be able to love you.

475
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,020
 That is the best feeling of looking someone in the eye,

476
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,100
 getting down to level and saying,

477
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,460
 hey, here's everything, everything I've done.

478
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,220
 The worst thing about me that I have concealed for so long,

479
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,560
 here it is.

480
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,540
 And they look at you right back in the eye and lean in

481
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,120
 and say, thank you, I love you.

482
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,780
 There's no better feeling than that

483
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,500
 because I think ultimately it's what we crave

484
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,160
 because that is what the Father does for us.

485
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,000
 So that's the benefit of allowing others in.

486
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,400
 When I got to Watermark back in July,

487
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,740
 it was the first time I really experienced

488
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,580
 something like this.

489
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,180
 I had kind of thought, okay,

490
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,140
 just confess your sins to one another.

491
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,100
 So like one person knows my stuff, I'm good.

492
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,180
 And I actually started to see what it looks like

493
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,660
 to walk in freedom and walk in the light in this place.

494
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,940
 I was shook.

495
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,380
 I was getting here and leaders were getting up on this stage.

496
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,100
 Women were getting on this stage,

497
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,980
 looking at this room full of people saying,

498
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,260
 I struggle with masturbation.

499
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,100
 And I was like.

500
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,020
 (congregation laughing)

501
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,380
 Did she just in front of, you know?

502
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,780
 And then like guys would get up and be like,

503
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,020
 yeah, I'm on staff here

504
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,420
 and I struggle with same sex attraction.

505
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,180
 I'm like, oh my gosh,

506
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,440
 he just put that out there for everyone to hear.

507
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,640
 How can he do that?

508
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,820
 And I started to wrestle and go,

509
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,740
 why can't I walk like that?

510
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,780
 And I started to actually go,

511
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,860
 okay, I think maybe I can do this

512
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,740
 'cause look, all they have around them is love,

513
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,300
 fully known, fully loved.

514
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,220
 And I started to confess and say things

515
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,300
 in front of groups of people.

516
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,060
 I started to confess a past of sexual sin and addiction

517
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,900
 that I have kept covered up for so long

518
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,260
 and I've experienced freedom

519
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,780
 and what it looks like to walk in the light.

520
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,580
 And it's the best decision I've ever made.

521
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,680
 And so whatever you're concealing,

522
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,860
 you will never find healing until you start revealing.

523
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,940
 So just start revealing it,

524
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,380
 start allowing others in.

525
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,880
 And the last thing I'll say is,

526
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,980
 a lot of us do not want to address step one.

527
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,780
 Like we don't want to admit that there's a problem.

528
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,180
 We don't want to allow others in

529
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,220
 because we know what that means for us.

530
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,300
 We know that that means

531
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,500
 that they're gonna actually lean in more and more

532
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,420
 and they're gonna make us do step three,

533
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,500
 which is address the roots.

534
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,620
 And some of you maybe have heard this language before

535
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,140
 and you're already like, uh-oh,

536
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,020
 'cause this is not fun.

537
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,540
 Like this is the source of all the problems.

538
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,820
 This is why we cope.

539
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,180
 This is why we numb.

540
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,480
 This is why we run to different things.

541
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,860
 This is why you run away

542
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,300
 and try to get that moment of escape

543
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:20,300
 is because you are so afraid to address the roots.

544
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,860
 And here's what I mean by addressing roots.

545
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,340
 I mean, really making yourself surface

546
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,620
 and think and deal with the things

547
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,700
 that have deeply wounded you.

548
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,300
 The things that have really hurt you

549
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,620
 or the thing that you have never told someone

550
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,420
 or that you're most ashamed of or you're most hurt by,

551
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,900
 you're gonna have to actually think about those things

552
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,740
 and that is not fun.

553
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,500
 I always say, let's be real,

554
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,380
 it hurts to think about the things that hurt you.

555
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,500
 We all agree?

556
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,340
 Like it hurts.

557
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,160
 No one wants to sit there

558
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,460
 and think about the time they were cheated on.

559
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,620
 I mean, it was like, you want me to what?

560
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,940
 You want me to think about that?

561
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,960
 And it's like, yeah, I do.

562
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,180
 No one wants to think about the things that hurt them,

563
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,800
 but it's what you have to do.

564
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,300
 If you want to experience healing now,

565
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,760
 if you wanna stop running to numbing and coping,

566
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,580
 you have to address the roots.

567
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,020
 So what do I mean by that?

568
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,320
 What do you mean by addressing the roots?

569
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,380
 Here's just some examples of what I mean,

570
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,640
 what it really looks like practically

571
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,380
 to address where you're numbing

572
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,480
 and how it's 'cause you're trying to escape

573
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,620
 because you don't wanna address roots.

574
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,860
 Some of you, after you eat, you go into the bathroom

575
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,680
 and you make yourself throw up

576
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,360
 and you've convinced yourself, here's why.

577
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,540
 I just wanna be skinnier

578
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,000
 and I just wanna be more attractive and this is how I do it.

579
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,860
 It's just a quick way to be skinnier.

580
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,360
 And no, that's not why.

581
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,200
 You do it because that is the one time in your life

582
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,360
 that you have total control

583
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,920
 of what's going on in your world.

584
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,400
 And that's all rooted in your parents' divorce

585
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,200
 in junior high that you had no control over.

586
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,320
 So therefore you've experienced such instability

587
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,580
 all of your life that has produced so much pain

588
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,200
 that now you're a control freak

589
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,720
 and you choose to throw up

590
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,140
 because it's when you actually have control.

591
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,980
 Throwing up is not your problem.

592
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,420
 You've made it your solution.

593
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,120
 Your problem is that you need to address

594
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,720
 that your parents' divorce deeply hurts you

595
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,400
 and that you felt rejected and not thought of

596
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,280
 and it created something in you

597
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,280
 that is now producing something that you never wanted to do.

598
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,720
 For some of you, you're the weekend warrior.

599
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,800
 You live for the weekends.

600
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,200
 You're the life of the party.

601
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,420
 You go out, you get high, you get blackout,

602
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,720
 you hook up, you're on your game.

603
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,860
 You told yourself, that's just what we do.

604
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,080
 That's just who I am.

605
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,280
 It's just fun, YOLO.

606
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,380
 That's not why.

607
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,560
 You do it because you moved to Dallas

608
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,760
 pursuing to climb the corporate ladder

609
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,640
 and you thought in the end it was results

610
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,800
 and you being validated

611
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,160
 and having some kind of significance to your life

612
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,840
 but you have to actually know that the reason why you do it

613
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,560
 is because you're miserable Monday to Thursday

614
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,400
 if you're honest.

615
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,360
 And so your weekend is the time where you shine

616
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,480
 and where you escape

617
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,000
 from how pathetic you feel Monday through Thursday.

618
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,440
 Alcohol is not your problem.

619
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,160
 Partying is not your problem.

620
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,920
 You've made it your solution.

621
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,160
 Your problem is that you are searching for significance

622
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,320
 in a job and in a position

623
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,720
 and climbing a ladder that has no end.

624
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,200
 Pornography, something we talk about a lot here.

625
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,840
 So many of us struggle with pornography.

626
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,480
 Some of you can't even remember when it began.

627
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,160
 It's just, it's everywhere.

628
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,040
 It's such an epidemic and it is ruining.

629
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,440
 It's a plague across this world.

630
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,440
 And we tell ourselves, everyone does it.

631
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,640
 It's casual, man.

632
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,960
 It's not hurting anyone.

633
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,800
 It's just me.

634
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,640
 It's just a quick fix.

635
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,360
 It just feels good, dude.

636
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,400
 No, that's not why.

637
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,280
 You do it because you're insecure

638
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,200
 about maybe your body

639
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,320
 or the fact that no one's ever asked you on a date

640
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
 or because every time you ask someone on a date,

641
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,480
 you get rejected

642
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,320
 or whatever it may be that produces that insecurity in you.

643
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,360
 And in that moment, you have control, you have pleasure.

644
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,440
 And on top of that, you feel more masculine.

645
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,840
 Or if you're a woman, you feel more desirable.

646
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,600
 That's why you look at it.

647
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,840
 Pornography, it's not your problem.

648
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
 You've made it your solution.

649
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,440
 Your problem is that you are searching for satisfaction.

650
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
 You are searching to be validated

651
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,020
 by something that will never satisfy.

652
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,720
 You're looking for it in all the wrong places.

653
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,600
 And right now, some of you are like, oh, it stings.

654
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,560
 I know for me, I'm like, oh,

655
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,440
 there are still deeply rooted things going on in my life

656
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,000
 that hurt, that I need to address.

657
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,720
 But if you want to actually experience the healing

658
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,080
 and freedom that Christ offers,

659
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,460
 you have to start with addressing the roots.

660
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,960
 And the way that you do that, the way that you get healthy,

661
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,920
 the way that you can actually address roots

662
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,740
 is to know truth, to know truth.

663
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,700
 When you know truth, you're able to identify lies.

664
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,060
 You're able to identify things

665
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,600
 that just aren't actually happening.

666
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,920
 You're able to like go, hey,

667
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,240
 these aren't actually my problems.

668
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,340
 These are my problems because I know truth.

669
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,600
 Jesus literally said in John 8, 32,

670
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,960
 "And you will know the truth

671
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,180
 and the truth will set you free."

672
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,800
 You're looking for freedom, know truth.

673
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,260
 We're walking around with a bunch of people right now

674
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,080
 who don't know truth.

675
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,020
 They don't open up their Bible to their believing lies.

676
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,820
 They're being fed what culture says, this will satisfy.

677
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,360
 This will bring you what you want.

678
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,200
 You want a way out?

679
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,520
 You want to escape?

680
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,480
 We have it for you.

681
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,480
 Take it, take social media, perform for other people,

682
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,000
 drink alcohol, have sex, watch pornography, take it.

683
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,720
 And we take it because we don't know truth.

684
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,700
 Because if you actually open up the Bible

685
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,280
 and you believed what it said,

686
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,120
 you would know that there is nothing but death

687
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,640
 in those things, but there's nothing but life in Jesus.

688
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,800
 And so we need to be a generation that opens up our Bible

689
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,020
 in a world with so many false narratives,

690
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,280
 so many things, so many mixed messages,

691
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,280
 open up our Bible and know and study truth.

692
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,400
 And when you know truth and when you read it,

693
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,500
 here's what you're gonna know.

694
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,300
 That the truth is above anything else,

695
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,400
 that God is in the business of restoration.

696
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,740
 He is looking to restore you.

697
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,880
 These things that are deeply rooted in you,

698
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,720
 He wants to restore them.

699
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,360
 And when you begin to open up your Bible and read the story,

700
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,280
 here's what you're gonna read.

701
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,760
 You're gonna read the greatest story of all time,

702
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,060
 that a father God saw the need of his children,

703
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,400
 saw the brokenness that was coming into your world,

704
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,120
 and he sent his one and only son to earth to bear your sin,

705
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,280
 bear your shame, bear your anxiety,

706
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,560
 bear the things that happened to you

707
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
 that you couldn't control.

708
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,520
 He bore it.

709
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,000
 He bore all the darkness, all the lies.

710
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,560
 He bore it and he died.

711
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,800
 He was the perfect sacrifice for me and for you.

712
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,120
 And not only did he die, but they buried him,

713
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,240
 but they could not keep him there

714
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,440
 'cause three days later, he rose victoriously from the tomb,

715
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,840
 conquering sin, conquering shame, conquering your mess,

716
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,760
 the thing that you are running to numbing and coping

717
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,000
 and all these things for,

718
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,600
 he actually died so you could stop running to those things

719
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,680
 and start running to Jesus.

720
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,440
 Start running to Him.

721
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,960
 And we, as people, are spending our young adult years,

722
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,760
 the most formative years of your life.

723
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,260
 You are spending your years running to something

724
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,640
 that has nothing for you.

725
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,080
 Even though you know truth, I'm telling you truth,

726
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,880
 you can run to Jesus because when he died and rose again,

727
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,960
 it was paid in full.

728
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,240
 Here's what Isaiah says.

729
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,800
 Isaiah 53, five says,

730
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,040
 "But he was pierced for our transgressions.

731
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,520
 "He was crushed for our iniquities.

732
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,760
 "The punishment that brought us peace was on him

733
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,960
 "and by his wounds, we are healed."

734
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,520
 In summary, we're wrapping up.

735
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,400
 Here's what I want you guys to know.

736
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,100
 Because of the blood of Jesus,

737
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,740
 because of the sacrifice that he paid for us,

738
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,360
 you are able to go home tonight

739
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,520
 and first admit that you are weak

740
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,080
 and that you have a problem.

741
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,540
 You're able to admit that

742
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,880
 because Christ and his sacrifice for you

743
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,440
 allows you to be weak because he goes,

744
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,320
 "I know you're weak. I know you're broken.

745
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,080
 "Father says, that's why I sent my son."

746
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,880
 You're able to then allow others in

747
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,640
 because God said, "Hey, I am so good.

748
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,160
 "I love you so much

749
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,800
 "that I never wanted you to do this alone.

750
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,880
 "You have me and then I'm giving you my people."

751
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,880
 And then you're also able to lastly address the roots,

752
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,240
 the things that you've believed for so long,

753
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,680
 the things that have wounded you for so long.

754
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,480
 You are able to actually experience.

755
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,040
 Some of you don't believe this still

756
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,320
 no matter how much I tell you,

757
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,880
 but let me tell you, listen,

758
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,360
 you are able to experience actual healing

759
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,360
 and freedom in fullness, fullness.

760
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,600
 You don't have to walk around

761
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,000
 like my finger partially healed.

762
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,880
 You don't have to walk around with a limp all your life,

763
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,240
 wounded and addicted and enslaved.

764
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,640
 I'm so tired of people saying

765
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,480
 that they are image bearers of Christ

766
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,680
 yet walking around limping and weak.

767
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,240
 He did not die for that.

768
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,240
 He died, He died so that you could be strong and victorious.

769
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:48,520
 He died, He bore physical wounds

770
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,600
 so that your spiritual wounds could be forever healed.

771
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,540
 By His stripes, we are healed.

772
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,400
 You wanna find freedom?

773
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,520
 You wanna make the decision to stop numbing,

774
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,440
 stop coping, stop running to the things of this world,

775
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,440
 start running to the Father.

776
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,160
 I don't care how many times you have to run,

777
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,640
 keep running and keep running and keep running

778
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,780
 because His arms are open for you.

779
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,400
 And He's sitting here saying,

780
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,400
 "Hey, you're searching and I've already done everything.

781
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,440
 It's not about what you do,

782
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,880
 it's about what I have already done.

783
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,720
 I have bore the stripes so that you may be healed,

784
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,680
 that you may be free.

785
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,760
 So maybe walk out of here tonight,

786
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,320
 not enslaved people, but free people."

787
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,100
 Let's pray.

788
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,760
 Father,

789
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:52,480
 I know the things that I have done

790
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,480
 and I know where my heart is prone to wander

791
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,720
 and not want to really address what's really going on.

792
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,840
 I don't really want to admit that I am so broken

793
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,480
 and so lonely apart from you.

794
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,300
 And so I come here with my friends

795
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,720
 just saying, "We need you, Jesus.

796
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,040
 We need you, Holy Spirit, to come and change our hearts

797
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,920
 and to remind our minds that in you,

798
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,560
 in you alone is freedom."

799
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,960
 When the course of this world

800
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,280
 is throwing things at us saying,

801
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,120
 "Here, taste this, taste this."

802
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,280
 And we just go again and again

803
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,560
 and we just remain thirsty and searching.

804
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,700
 May we remember tonight,

805
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,600
 may tonight be the night that we decide

806
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,280
 that I am going all in with the sufficiency

807
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,420
 and the satisfaction that is in the fullness

808
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,400
 of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

809
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,840
 And I'm never going back.

810
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,800
 I am taking a drink of the living water

811
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,460
 and I am never going to thirst again in Jesus' name.

812
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,840
 If there are people here tonight

813
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,360
 who don't even know what it looks like

814
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,520
 to have a relationship with you,

815
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,040
 I pray that they would first

816
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:14,740
 allow themselves to come to you, confess,

817
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,780
 and to receive all that you have for them.

818
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,000
 But for the rest of us that know you

819
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,920
 but don't live like it all the time,

820
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,720
 we come here tonight saying we need you and we want you,

821
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,000
 and we're gonna keep running to you.

822
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,180
 No longer running to the things of this world,

823
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,680
 but running to you.

824
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,520
 It's your name that I pray, amen.

825
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,320
 You guys can stand and sing with us.
