1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:24,960
 Thank you, Josiah.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,400
 Was anybody here alive in 1950?

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,360
 OK, that's when I came on the scene.

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,720
 I saw the porch.

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,920
 I saw a watermark when it was just a gleam

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,560
 in the eye of a bunch of guys.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,840
 So this is a special delight from the prayers

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,960
 that went up for you before you were ever here.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
 I want to show you something, because we're about to start

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,560
 Ecclesiastes.

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,000
 Is that right, Josiah?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,880
 Says you to me, we're going to start Ecclesiastes.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,280
 Could you teach something on this?

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,360
 I said, man, I wrote a book on this.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,440
 It's sold dozens of copies over these years.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,400
 Take a look in your Bible at the book of Ecclesiastes,

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,600
 or your computer machine, or your phone,

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,560
 or whatever you have there.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,920
 And so in Ecclesiastes chapter 1, in your Old Testament,

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,000
 you've got the history from Genesis to Nehemiah.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,720
 And then after that, you've got the prophets

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,680
 from Isaiah to Malachi.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,840
 That's the beginning and end of your Old Testament.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,220
 And right in the middle, you have

26
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,080
 what are called the wisdom books.

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,760
 Psalms, Proverbs, Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,440
 I forgot one.

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
 Job.

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,520
 All of those books are kind of the philosophy books.

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,760
 They're called the poetry books, because they deal

32
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,560
 with the heart issues of life.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,920
 What got them in trouble in the history books,

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,040
 what got them prophesied about in the prophets,

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,280
 that of man and sin in this world.

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,720
 And so those five books right in the middle

37
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,320
 they're kind of philosophy poetry books

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,560
 about the issue of living your life in a world that has fallen.

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,400
 Let me ask you, can you torch your life real quickly

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,440
 by bad decisions?

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
 Yes, you can.

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
 Or you can make it a joy.

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,400
 You can build it on sand, build it on the rock, either way.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,040
 And so these books talk about the moral decisions.

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
 It's almost like they say, here's

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
 what you should have done in the history

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,640
 so you won't end up like you're going to be in the prophets

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,920
 if you'd have done this.

49
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,800
 So you stay with me right here.

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,200
 Ecclesiastes.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,480
 Whenever you talk to people that are having a problem with God,

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,680
 the Bible, Christianity, it's usually

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,280
 because of four things.

54
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,560
 They see a problem between God and reason.

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,600
 The Trinity, the virgin birth, the death, burial, resurrection.

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,440
 That doesn't fit into my grid of what I've experienced.

57
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,080
 Secondly, they'll have a problem between God and science.

58
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,800
 Darwin says this.

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,040
 This guy says this.

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,520
 Stephen-- what's his name?

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,920
 Stephen Hawking.

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
 He says this.

63
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,400
 The Bible says this.

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,520
 I got a problem with God and science.

65
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,240
 Got a problem with God and the news.

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,360
 Got a problem with God and national geographic.

67
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,560
 Who do I believe?

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,240
 And then they'll have a problem between scripture

69
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,680
 and scripture.

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,520
 Matthew says this, but Mark says it.

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,400
 Luke says this.

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,760
 John says this.

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,680
 Judges says this.

74
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,600
 Joshua says this.

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,960
 King says this.

76
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,360
 Chronicles says this.

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,280
 Whenever you get parallel accounts,

78
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,400
 they're never going to be identical.

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,040
 They'll be not contradictory, but complementary.

80
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,720
 And so they'll see those and demand

81
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,080
 of those which you would demand of no other works.

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
 And so they'll have a problem with what they

83
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,560
 see as internal inconsistency.

84
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,480
 And then the other problem is what Ecclesiastes is about.

85
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,360
 And this is a problem with God and evil.

86
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,840
 It's called theodicy.

87
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,200
 Theodicae.

88
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,760
 Dicae means judgment.

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 Theo means God.

90
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,480
 God under judgment.

91
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,560
 It's when man calls God to the bar of human reason.

92
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,360
 How many of you have ever had the experience

93
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
 or know somebody that's had it that will not entertain

94
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,680
 the notion of God because something so painful

95
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,560
 happened to them that they cannot figure,

96
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,440
 how could a loving God dot, dot, dot?

97
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,520
 And it goes like that.

98
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,200
 How could a loving God let my parents divorce?

99
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,320
 How could a loving God let my brother die of cerebral palsy?

100
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,480
 How could a loving God allow a Holocaust?

101
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,560
 How could-- and all of us have had things happen in our lives

102
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,400
 that we wondered where God was.

103
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,720
 The psalmist reflects it.

104
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,400
 Proverbs reflects it.

105
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
 Job majored in it.

106
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,720
 And so yeah, Ecclesiastes is about living

107
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,680
 in a world that is not the best of all possible worlds,

108
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,400
 but it's on the way to the best of all possible worlds.

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,200
 It's God and evil that we deal with.

110
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,320
 The first two chapters, the name God

111
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,280
 is only going to be mentioned in passing.

112
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,120
 We're going to look at what life is like under the sun.

113
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
 We're not going to look at what God says about it.

114
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,160
 We're not going to quote in the Old Testament.

115
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,800
 We're just going to look at life down here under the sun

116
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,040
 and where we're going to find answers if God does not speak.

117
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,680
 It's a very melancholy two chapters.

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,960
 You want to hear it and go throw yourself off a bridge.

119
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
 OK.

120
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,680
 But hang on.

121
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,160
 All right.

122
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
 Are you with me so far?

123
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,000
 God under the sun.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,960
 How do I coexist in a world that has evil?

125
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,160
 He begins in verse 1, the words of--

126
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,440
 and it's a Hebrew word called the koheleth, the preacher.

127
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
 When you think of preacher, you think of the word

128
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,880
 of God being heralded.

129
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,480
 He begins very optimistically.

130
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,360
 I'm going to tell you something that is divine truth,

131
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,880
 and it's going to carry you through life.

132
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,480
 Now, I want to assure you what I'm going to teach you here

133
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,980
 and what Josiah is going to bring you

134
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,960
 for the next few weeks, you will apply it.

135
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,680
 A lot of you are going to apply it before you even got here.

136
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,320
 It's Ecclesiastes.

137
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,640
 It's the koheleth, the preacher, the son

138
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,200
 of David King in Jerusalem.

139
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,720
 That is Solomon.

140
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,600
 Solomon is the richest guy that ever lived.

141
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,200
 He is the most hedonistic guy that ever lived, 700 wives.

142
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,560
 Are you serious?

143
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,840
 He is the most intellectual man, called

144
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,720
 the wisest man of his day.

145
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,280
 So if you have wisdom, you have money, you have pleasure,

146
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,360
 you would think you've got it all.

147
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,760
 God's going to take a guy.

148
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,040
 Francis Schaeffer, the great theologian,

149
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,320
 apologist said back in my day, he

150
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,640
 said God took Solomon, a guy with all the smarts,

151
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,440
 all the money, all the pleasure, and he propels him

152
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,160
 to the end of the universe to see what

153
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
 life is like without God.

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
 And he comes back and says, if you've got wisdom,

155
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
 you've got money, you've got pleasure, and you don't have

156
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,720
 God, you've got nothing.

157
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,240
 You have got vanity, vanity, all is vanity.

158
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,680
 Be encouraged, OK?

159
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,600
 Verse 2.

160
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,200
 So let's see what Solomon found in his journey.

161
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,080
 If some guy like me goes out and says

162
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,560
 there's no life without God, you're

163
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,160
 going to say, well, you ain't that smart,

164
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,800
 you're not that rich, you ain't got that much hedone to enjoy.

165
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,480
 Solomon can trump every one of us

166
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,520
 as far as money, wealth, and pleasure.

167
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,560
 He's had it.

168
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,680
 If he can't find it, you're not going to find it either.

169
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,000
 So he says in verse 2, "Vanity of vanities."

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,120
 Just like in Israel, you had the holy of holies.

171
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,480
 Of all the holiness there was, this was the holy place.

172
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,000
 "Vanity of vanities," says the preacher.

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,360
 Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.

174
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,080
 Incidentally, one of the first guys in the Bible

175
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,000
 is named Vanity.

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,520
 Adam and Eve had a kid named Cain.

177
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,760
 He didn't work out real well.

178
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,320
 And we had a kid that took his place in the line that

179
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,760
 would produce Messiah.

180
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,320
 And his name was Abel.

181
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,920
 And that's what the word vanity is in Hebrew.

182
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,120
 Abel.

183
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,520
 Because she had a kid named Cain and named him

184
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,400
 begotten with the help of God.

185
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,200
 This is the child that maybe is going

186
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,880
 to be the seed of woman that will crush the serpent's head.

187
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,800
 And after he had been around a little while,

188
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,040
 she named the next kid, you're a loser.

189
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,280
 That's what it means.

190
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,120
 All right.

191
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,600
 Abel.

192
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 It means vanity.

193
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,920
 This kid ain't going to make it on his own.

194
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,080
 And so in verse 3, or rather verse 2,

195
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,960
 he says, "Abel, Abel, all is Abel."

196
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,000
 In verse 3.

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,360
 Now, he's going to explain what vanity means.

198
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,600
 He doesn't mean that life is meaningless.

199
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,200
 He means that life is, in verse 3,

200
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,120
 what advantage does man have in all of his work?

201
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,720
 It's the Hebrew word prophet, P-R-O-F-I-T.

202
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,240
 What prophet?

203
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,320
 When you die, Josiah, how much are you

204
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,680
 going to leave behind?

205
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,280
 Everything.

206
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,480
 It's all gone.

207
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,760
 No U-Hauls following a hearse.

208
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,480
 All right.

209
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,640
 You're going to leave it all.

210
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,160
 Mark Twain, an agnostic, he said, "When man dies,

211
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,360
 the world laments him for an hour and forgets him forever."

212
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,080
 You're gone.

213
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,760
 It says that at the end of his life,

214
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,560
 God bestows on him the only untainted gift

215
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,240
 he ever received, death.

216
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,880
 Depressive guy, Mark Twain.

217
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,240
 And so what prophet does a man have in all of his work,

218
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,320
 which he has done?

219
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,920
 And he uses this term, under the sun.

220
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,360
 It's Solomon's term about life.

221
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,240
 We're not going to talk about God the creator making himself

222
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,920
 known through his word, whereby I might have new birth.

223
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,080
 That's another sermon for another day.

224
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,480
 We're talking here about the college scenario.

225
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,360
 About have you all discovered that at college,

226
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,760
 they don't play Amazing Grace on the chimes?

227
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
 It's not a Christian place generally.

228
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,360
 It's a place that is secular.

229
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,280
 It's man trying to find his answers.

230
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,840
 And so he says, what prophet does a man have under the sun?

231
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,720
 Life without the Bible, life without God,

232
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,360
 just a complete secular man.

233
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,800
 And in verse four, he says, here's what prophet you have.

234
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,360
 A generation goes, they die.

235
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,200
 A generation comes.

236
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,720
 The earth remains forever.

237
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,760
 A guy is born.

238
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,120
 He goes a number of years.

239
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,200
 He dies.

240
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,600
 But the earth keeps on going.

241
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,200
 The world does not reward you.

242
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,800
 The world life does not hit a climactic point

243
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,360
 that you find ultimate joy, peace, and nirvana.

244
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,160
 You don't explode into space, like Stephen Will said

245
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,040
 in my day.

246
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,080
 Anybody?

247
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,760
 OK.

248
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,960
 And so he says, a generation is going to be born.

249
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,360
 They're going to die.

250
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,720
 And we're all going to grieve over you, wipe our eyes,

251
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,320
 then head off downtown, eat some Tex-Mex.

252
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,400
 All right.

253
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,440
 And you're done.

254
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,800
 Welcome to the porch, OK?

255
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,320
 He says in verse five, in verse five, verse six, and verse

256
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,960
 seven, are wheels of the cosmos.

257
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,880
 There's always this tension between man,

258
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,040
 a sentient being with knowledge and longings,

259
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,760
 and a cosmos that is nothing more than animals that

260
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,120
 are hardwired and plants that have life cycles.

261
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,200
 There's nothing to give us ultimate meaning.

262
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,240
 And so in verse five, the sun rises, sun sets,

263
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,000
 hastening to its place.

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,560
 It rises again.

265
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,080
 Look at it.

266
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,600
 It's going.

267
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,840
 Big pocket, pocket, pocket, pocket, pocket, pocket,

268
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,360
 pocket.

269
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,080
 The sun is rising and falling, and it keeps going.

270
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,760
 It does not applaud you.

271
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,040
 It does not reward you for anything that you do.

272
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,280
 It just grinds you up.

273
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,560
 And here in verse six, blowing to the south,

274
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,640
 turning to the north.

275
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,480
 The wind continues swirling along on its circular courses.

276
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,960
 The wind returns.

277
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
 So we got the sun.

278
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,360
 Pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket.

279
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,480
 And then we got the wind.

280
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
 Kee-yoo, kee-yoo.

281
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,600
 Pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket to kee-yoo, kee-yoo.

282
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,240
 So we've got these wheels going right here.

283
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,920
 And then in verse seven, the rivers flow into the sea,

284
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,880
 yet the sea is not full.

285
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,840
 To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.

286
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,320
 Why?

287
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,280
 Because we've got evaporation.

288
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,520
 The rivers come in, evaporation.

289
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,200
 Shee-psh, shee-psh.

290
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,160
 Pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket.

291
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,760
 Shee-yoo, shee-yoo.

292
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,640
 When I've done this in past days, Josiah,

293
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,720
 I would have three guys stand up here.

294
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,920
 And one of them be this, one of them be this, one of them

295
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,400
 be this.

296
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,160
 And it is.

297
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,040
 It's like a big machine, and it's grinding you up.

298
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,360
 You're going to hit your physical prowess at 27.

299
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,200
 How old are you, Josiah?

300
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,480
 40, sorry.

301
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,320
 Yeah.

302
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,640
 You're going to start going down.

303
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,320
 Can you stuff now?

304
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,400
 Enjoy.

305
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,360
 All right.

306
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,840
 Because you ain't in a little bit.

307
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,000
 You white?

308
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,680
 All right.

309
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,760
 White boys can't jump.

310
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,720
 That's just the way they are.

311
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,880
 Verse 8.

312
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,440
 In verse 8, we're looking at the machine.

313
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,200
 And Solomon says, all things are wearisome.

314
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,480
 You ever hear the guy that just said the world

315
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
 was a merry-go-round?

316
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,760
 I want it to stop and let me off.

317
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,640
 I want to stop and have some kind of meaning and rest.

318
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,880
 Does the world ever hit a climactic place

319
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,680
 that it just awards you?

320
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,160
 It doesn't.

321
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,040
 You are young.

322
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,920
 You get older.

323
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,800
 You hit adolescence.

324
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,920
 You start going downhill.

325
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,080
 Your kids come out.

326
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,760
 You get my age, where your kids are going through your house

327
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,800
 going, that's mine.

328
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,600
 That's mine.

329
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,160
 How long you going to live, Daddy?

330
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,660
 OK.

331
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,000
 [LAUGHTER]

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,640
 So you're heading down.

333
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,920
 OK?

334
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,880
 And so all things are wearisome.

335
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,840
 Are you all with me so far?

336
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,600
 Life is going to grind you up.

337
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,080
 When you go back for your first reunion, you're only about 28.

338
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,200
 Your body's looking pretty good, see?

339
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,720
 At 38, everybody's getting a little bit humbler, OK?

340
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,200
 Because your marriage is now trying not to tank.

341
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,120
 About 48, you now got kids.

342
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,080
 And you're going to find out why in nature,

343
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,920
 mothers eat their young, all right?

344
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,040
 Because them kids are going south on you, all right?

345
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,680
 [LAUGHTER]

346
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:45,000
 I just got back from a reunion, our 50th reunion, OK?

347
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,080
 [APPLAUSE]

348
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,880
 Oh, man.

349
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,280
 Man, humility sets in, because everybody looks really bad,

350
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,640
 all right?

351
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,560
 Lord.

352
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,240
 And so in verse 8, even though all things are wearisome,

353
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,760
 what's the next line says?

354
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,240
 "Man is not able to tell it."

355
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,720
 Man will not back off and say, man in himself,

356
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,160
 with his reason, with his experience,

357
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,480
 is not going to find ultimate answers of his origin,

358
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,600
 his nature and dignity, his moral code, what evil is,

359
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,800
 redemption is, where history is going.

360
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,840
 He's not going to find it.

361
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,880
 Are you all noticing the word God hasn't been mentioned?

362
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,280
 That's for a reason.

363
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,400
 He's looking at life under the sun.

364
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,280
 He's not going to mention God here for a while.

365
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,200
 It's been said that in this book,

366
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,640
 the name Yahweh, for God, is not used,

367
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,400
 the covenant name of Israel.

368
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,840
 It's the word Elohim, the generic name,

369
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,440
 that it's a book not just to the Jew.

370
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,040
 He only mentions one aspect of the law in chapter 5.

371
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,920
 But it's a book that the Gentile can read.

372
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,840
 Can man find life, meaning and joy without God?

373
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,400
 Can you do it?

374
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,640
 When Adam is created,

375
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,200
 the first thing he sees is a theophany,

376
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,440
 God making himself known in a human form

377
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,840
 because Adam corresponds with who God is.

378
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,800
 God is more human in that sense than we are.

379
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,600
 We reflect him or in his image.

380
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,120
 He sees God.

381
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,320
 And in the light of God,

382
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,640
 God says, "This is what the stars are.

383
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,320
 This is what the ground is.

384
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,880
 This is why your hand is cool when it rushes

385
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,520
 because there's something out here."

386
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,920
 And it's called the firmament, and it's for you to breathe.

387
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,400
 And the plants take in the CO2.

388
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,720
 What's CO2? Don't worry about it.

389
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,760
 All right?

390
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,440
 And they're going to give off oxygen,

391
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,640
 and we're going to have a little cycle.

392
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,600
 And these are animals.

393
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
 They're not you, but they're hardwired.

394
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,280
 They're going to act a certain way.

395
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,560
 You're going to have joy.

396
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,440
 And so before Adam does anything, Adam is a theologian.

397
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,160
 He knows who God is.

398
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,400
 And now you can understand life.

399
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,360
 Now, Adam, do you understand who I am?

400
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,200
 Yes.

401
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
 Now you can have a wife.

402
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,040
 What's a wife?

403
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,080
 Lay down.

404
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,200
 All right.

405
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,840
 Out she comes, Adam.

406
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,120
 This is bone of your bone.

407
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,360
 Eve, this is the one created first.

408
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,920
 He's bigger than you, hairier than you.

409
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,400
 He's going to take care of you.

410
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,240
 All right.

411
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,160
 So there's order.

412
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,280
 And so in the original creation,

413
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,600
 everybody knows who God is.

414
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,680
 And now you start living.

415
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,000
 That's the way it has to work.

416
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,720
 You've got to know God.

417
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,520
 Then you can have relationships and a job

418
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,560
 and handle your money and have friends.

419
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
 If you don't have God,

420
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,120
 you're like an astronaut on a spacewalk.

421
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,120
 What's the most important bit of uniform that he has?

422
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,080
 It's his tether that holds him to the mother's ship.

423
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,640
 Because when you cut that tether,

424
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,800
 you are lost in the vacuum.

425
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,760
 What's the tether that holds you to reality?

426
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,040
 It's God.

427
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,920
 So you can be brilliant, wealthy, and everything else.

428
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,800
 You lose touch with God

429
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,280
 and it's going to suck you into the vacuum.

430
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,040
 And so he's trying to get us reconciled

431
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,880
 to the infinite personal God.

432
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,000
 Our country started that way.

433
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,680
 We drifted and have only in little periods come back.

434
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,000
 But that's been the story of man.

435
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,880
 The story of man is Genesis 1, Revelation 22.

436
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
 Man in the garden, man recreated

437
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,240
 and a new heaven and new earth garden.

438
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,200
 And in between is a footnote

439
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,640
 to how screwed up this thing has become.

440
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,840
 But that's the alpha and the omega of your Bible.

441
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,280
 Man reunited with God.

442
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,320
 So if you are wealthy, handsome, smart,

443
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,520
 and all those things, you don't know God,

444
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,560
 you ain't got a cut dog's chance.

445
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,160
 And I don't know what that means.

446
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
 (congregation laughing)

447
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,280
 But you ain't got one.

448
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,440
 Can I preach here?

449
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,640
 Keep looking right here.

450
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,360
 Are you with me so far?

451
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,200
 All right.

452
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,520
 And so man isn't able to tell it.

453
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,680
 Life ought to discourage you at age three.

454
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,240
 But man will not embrace a system that holds him guilty.

455
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,440
 That's why you can preach any other religion

456
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,800
 and everybody will respond.

457
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
 They don't hold you guilty.

458
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,320
 The Bible says, welcome,

459
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,720
 your deeds of righteousness are filthy rags.

460
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,320
 And now we get in line to be forgiven

461
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,160
 and to become morally accountable.

462
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,800
 And so man cannot figure this out.

463
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,040
 As a result, the eye is not satisfied with seeing.

464
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,680
 The ear is filled with hearing.

465
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,800
 Man's always looking and listening.

466
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,280
 Maybe somebody somewhere in some religion

467
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,360
 can give me something that'll make me have meaning.

468
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,800
 Man's always in a quest.

469
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,080
 As a matter of fact, when they kick Cain,

470
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,040
 no, no, no.

471
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,200
 Yeah, Cain out of the garden.

472
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,080
 It said he settled in the land of Nod.

473
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
 That means wanderer.

474
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,320
 Always looking for something.

475
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,360
 I was in the '60s.

476
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,160
 We were trying drugs.

477
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,120
 We were trying money.

478
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,800
 We tried communism.

479
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,400
 We tried, you name it.

480
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
 We tried everything we could.

481
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,240
 We tried success.

482
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,160
 We couldn't find it.

483
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,800
 By God's grace, we had a Jesus revolution.

484
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,920
 People came back.

485
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,360
 But we could not find any ultimate meaning

486
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,920
 until a bunch of us found Jesus Christ

487
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,080
 that brought us back dead center to God.

488
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,320
 Well, he says, man is gonna keep looking.

489
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,640
 That's why in about the 15th century,

490
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,680
 Europe had gone to pot.

491
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,880
 And so they now start coming west.

492
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,520
 Maybe over here we can find the cities of Cibola.

493
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,120
 Maybe over here we can find the Fountain of Youth.

494
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,720
 Maybe we can find a unicorn or two,

495
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,640
 or a mermaid, or something over here that can give us life.

496
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,600
 Well, we came over here.

497
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,560
 You know what we found?

498
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,040
 The same as Europe.

499
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,960
 We found a bunch of sinners.

500
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,840
 And so that's why there's always this longing.

501
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,480
 That's why whenever I was around y'all's age,

502
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,640
 we had the drug culture.

503
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,160
 It wasn't for recreation.

504
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,080
 It was philosophy.

505
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,080
 The word psychedelic means mind expanding.

506
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,080
 Maybe in an LSD trip, I can find truth and God out here.

507
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
 But you couldn't.

508
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,400
 That's why there's so much of a preoccupation today

509
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,560
 with UFOs.

510
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,360
 Man can't fix it.

511
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,240
 Maybe Saturn can.

512
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,800
 And so maybe some guy,

513
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,080
 but they always land at a double wide in West Virginia.

514
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,440
 Have you ever noticed that?

515
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,080
 I don't know why that is.

516
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,000
 I can't find, and anyway, I've seen all them UFO movies.

517
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,320
 When they land, they eat you.

518
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,160
 All right?

519
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,880
 So you take off running if you see one of them land.

520
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,080
 Maybe some guy from Venus can fix this.

521
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,440
 All right?

522
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,440
 And so maybe science can, maybe artificial intelligence.

523
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,280
 Maybe that can, maybe we'll do a revolution every four years

524
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,080
 and get a new president and he'll lead us on.

525
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,400
 Maybe we'll elect new guys.

526
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,960
 They'll lead us on.

527
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,600
 We're always, man is not able to tell it.

528
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,160
 We're always clawing and looking.

529
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,600
 Amen?

530
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,200
 Keep watching here.

531
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,080
 And verse nine, that which has been, past,

532
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,160
 is that which will be, future.

533
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,720
 That which has been done, past, is that which will be done.

534
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,200
 Your attempts have already been tried.

535
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
 You want to find life?

536
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,520
 Get you a white belt and some bell bottoms.

537
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,440
 We tried it.

538
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,640
 Smoke you some dope.

539
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,560
 We tried it.

540
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,840
 How about free set?

541
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,720
 We tried it.

542
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,840
 You name it, we did it.

543
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,240
 It's doom.

544
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,520
 Be encouraged.

545
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,280
 And so in verse nine, there is nothing,

546
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,640
 look close at your Bible.

547
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,800
 Watch the word.

548
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,400
 There is nothing new.

549
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,480
 Nothing novel.

550
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
 Nobody from Venus.

551
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,560
 Nobody from Portland.

552
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,800
 Nobody's gonna find something new.

553
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,280
 All the philosophies have been tried.

554
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,600
 We've run the gamut.

555
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,680
 We're now in existentialism,

556
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,840
 where you don't create, God doesn't create you,

557
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,080
 you create God.

558
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,840
 What do you want truth to be?

559
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,640
 What's your truth?

560
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,480
 Find it.

561
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,680
 That's where we are now.

562
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,440
 Man now has become God.

563
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,640
 So he said, there's nothing new.

564
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
 Incidentally, do y'all remember

565
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,800
 when Paul is at Mars Hill at Athens,

566
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,520
 all the philosophers gathered daily

567
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,720
 to talk about anything,

568
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,880
 anything new.

569
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,360
 That's why you went to Mars Hill.

570
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,200
 Is anybody saying anything that hadn't been said?

571
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,360
 Paul started preaching and they called him a name.

572
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,680
 They said, yeah, this guy's a spermalogus.

573
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,080
 You ever been called a spermalogus?

574
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,560
 That'll make you a fight, my friend.

575
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,280
 You don't even know what it means.

576
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,000
 Sperm means a seed.

577
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,560
 Logos means to speak or to pick.

578
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,040
 A spermalogus is a seed picker.

579
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,720
 And it means he doesn't say anything new.

580
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,040
 He's just taking a little eclectic,

581
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,120
 taking a little something here,

582
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,960
 a little something here,

583
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,880
 a little something here,

584
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,440
 repackaging it, and it's the old stuff.

585
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,680
 But a bunch of guys listening to Paul said,

586
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,440
 oh no, Acts 17.

587
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,280
 He speaks of strange deities.

588
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,040
 It's the Greek word heteros, different.

589
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,920
 He's speaking of a God we've never heard of

590
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,680
 because he spaketh of Jesus and the resurrection.

591
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,080
 He's talking about God becoming one of us,

592
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,840
 dying on a cross, rising from the dead,

593
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,560
 saving us by faith, returning someday.

594
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,280
 And so the old philosopher said,

595
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,280
 oh no, we've never heard nothing like this guy.

596
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,960
 So man's looking for something new.

597
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,200
 You must be born again.

598
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,360
 It's gotta be a new birth.

599
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,800
 Well, in verse 10,

600
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,120
 is there anything of which somebody might say,

601
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,160
 see, this is new.

602
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,680
 It's existed for ages, which were before us.

603
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,920
 Solomon said, I've been around the block.

604
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,820
 You can't tell me anything the Egyptians hadn't tried.

605
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,360
 The Babylonians, the Syrians, all these guys,

606
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,300
 we've all tried it.

607
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,340
 In verse 11, man is doomed to repeat his error.

608
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,160
 There is no remembrance of earlier things

609
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,280
 or of later things which will occur.

610
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,460
 There'll be no remembrance among those who come later still.

611
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,360
 Man is doomed to be confined

612
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,800
 within the limits of his own reason,

613
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,840
 his own experience and his own guilt,

614
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,360
 that he can't go outside of himself

615
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,800
 to see who the infinite personal God is.

616
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,840
 What's the most important verse in your Bible?

617
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,880
 It's Genesis 1.1.

618
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,360
 There's a beginning of the creation.

619
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,320
 God was there, made the heavens, made the earth, made you.

620
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,720
 We invade upon his existence.

621
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,520
 The only reason the universe exists is because of him.

622
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,440
 Once we begin there, we can let this God speak

623
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,320
 and he can show us who we are, what is our duty,

624
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,960
 what sin is, how redemption comes,

625
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,520
 what eternity will look like.

626
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,160
 Can you dig it?

627
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,360
 It's the ultimate belief system, is Christianity,

628
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,880
 because it deals with eternity.

629
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,400
 Had a guy say to me in a gym one time,

630
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,740
 he said, you know, you're a Christian.

631
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,180
 Don't you know that a nice guy is finished last?

632
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,680
 I said, yeah, but bad guys go to hell.

633
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,520
 Okay.

634
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,360
 So you got to deal with eternity.

635
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,120
 I don't know where that conversation went, but.

636
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,720
 I'm gonna stop right there just a second.

637
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,920
 Are you with me so far?

638
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,680
 So you notice he hadn't talked about God.

639
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:48,600
 It's talked about man under the sun, making life on his own.

640
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,960
 If you don't know the God of the heavens and the earth,

641
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,220
 that incarnated himself into creation through his word,

642
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,900
 died and physically rose and can bring conversion

643
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,600
 from the outside in, you have not got a chance

644
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,020
 in this earth.

645
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,680
 If it could have been found, it would have,

646
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,200
 and we haven't found it.

647
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,280
 And so he says, because think about it, Josiah,

648
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,440
 before you get saved, you got to get lost.

649
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,240
 He's getting you lost in space.

650
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,160
 In verse 12 and following,

651
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,800
 and I'm just gonna touch on these.

652
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,280
 He's gonna show you the three options

653
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,600
 that men try without God.

654
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,460
 First, he's gonna try in verse 13, knowledge.

655
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,080
 I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom

656
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,840
 all that's been done under heaven.

657
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,840
 He's studying history, politics, philosophy, economics.

658
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,720
 Have y'all ever gone to college with a perennial student?

659
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,920
 That's just always learning.

660
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,320
 Well, that's what he's trying to do.

661
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,520
 It's your freshman year when you're gonna go

662
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,540
 and learn stuff, hypothetically.

663
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:13,080
 And he says in verse 13, to do this is a grievous task

664
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,440
 God has given, the Hebrew says, to the sons of Adam.

665
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,680
 We're fallen.

666
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,640
 So if you're gonna search and find through Freud

667
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,240
 and Nietzsche and Socrates and the Gilgamesh epic

668
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,800
 and all of these, if you're gonna find truth, good luck.

669
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,800
 Solomon says it's a grievous task to try to do this.

670
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,200
 He says in verse 14, I've seen all the works

671
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,000
 which has been done under the sun

672
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,160
 and behold, it's vanity.

673
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,160
 We don't find any solutions

674
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,740
 because what's crooked can't be straightened.

675
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,740
 Life is immediately screwed up.

676
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,160
 Humans are screwed up.

677
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,920
 The family is screwed up.

678
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,560
 The government is screwed up.

679
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,940
 Human religions are screwed up.

680
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,840
 He says, it's crooked.

681
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,400
 He goes on and says, what's lacking can't be counted.

682
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,900
 Everything falls short.

683
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,080
 Tom Brady after Super Bowl V, he said,

684
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,280
 you're never satisfied.

685
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,120
 I gotta do Super Bowl VI, then VII.

686
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,700
 You never have enough money.

687
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,880
 What's lacking can't be counted.

688
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,400
 And I said, look, I've magnified and increased wisdom

689
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,200
 more than all who were over Jerusalem before me.

690
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,800
 My mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.

691
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,280
 He said, if I couldn't find it,

692
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,800
 you guys aren't gonna find it.

693
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,680
 He says in 17, I set my mind to know wisdom

694
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,480
 and then madness and folly.

695
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,000
 I looked at the good guys and I looked at the bad guys

696
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,240
 and I realized this is striving after wind

697
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,280
 because in verse 18, in much wisdom, there is much pain.

698
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,680
 In increasing knowledge, there is increasing pain.

699
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,880
 I see the problems, but I can't fix them.

700
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,480
 They're unalterably messed up.

701
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,560
 It's like man had a conversation with the devil

702
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,760
 or something.

703
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,080
 Let me bring you back to that.

704
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,280
 In the Garden of Eden, God says to Adam and Eve,

705
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,560
 here's the tree of life.

706
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,900
 You take it like communion.

707
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,140
 You fellowship with me.

708
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,600
 Over here is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

709
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,160
 where you will try to know good and evil by yourself.

710
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,600
 It's the tree of alienation, or we would say humanism,

711
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,320
 of man making himself God.

712
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,100
 Here comes the serpent.

713
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,200
 He says to the woman, has God said,

714
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,960
 you shall not eat from any tree?

715
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
 From any tree of the garden, you can eat freely.

716
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,260
 From the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

717
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,040
 you don't eat or touch it, lest you die.

718
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,860
 You shall not surely die.

719
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,420
 That's a myth, Eve.

720
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,220
 To try to know good and evil on your own

721
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,760
 and to make it in life without God, that is not a bad thing.

722
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,540
 The reason that that's wrong is that God can't be trusted.

723
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,340
 He's a bad guy.

724
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,720
 And he knows the day you eat of it,

725
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,020
 you're gonna know good and evil

726
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,340
 and you won't need him anymore.

727
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,280
 So Eve, the worst thing ever happened to you

728
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,180
 was God who wants to dominate you.

729
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:36,180
 You break free and follow, well, me, and will be free.

730
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,640
 Get your motor running, way out on the highway,

731
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,040
 looking for adventure in whatever comes your way.

732
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,040
 Like a true nature's child, you were born to be wild.

733
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:58,580
 Fire all your guns at once and explode into space.

734
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,860
 Y'all ever hear that when you go to college?

735
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,780
 You still go to church and read your Bible?

736
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,940
 Child, you need to grow up and fly, little bird.

737
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,740
 Let's smoke this, drink that, do this.

738
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,820
 And you'll find life.

739
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,300
 God said, in the day you eat of it,

740
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,820
 you will surely, you're a dead man.

741
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,220
 We have cut your tether and you're gone.

742
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,860
 Chapter two, I said to myself,

743
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,540
 come now, I'll test you with pleasure.

744
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,120
 So we've tried intellectualism, let's try hedonism.

745
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,820
 We're now in our sophomore year.

746
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:44,600
 We're gonna pledge Kappa Alouette over here, okay.

747
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,900
 He said, I'll test you with pleasure.

748
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,020
 I love the next phrase, enjoy yourself.

749
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,260
 Like a commercial, go for the high life.

750
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,180
 And I said of laughter, I said, it was futility.

751
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,700
 I said of laughter, it's crazy.

752
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,440
 I remember in my pagan days,

753
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,060
 I went to the University of North Texas.

754
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,540
 Did you tell them I was one of the great quarterbacks

755
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,060
 in the history of college football?

756
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,300
 Led my team to seven wins in four years

757
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,660
 that I was at North Texas.

758
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:23,180
 Ever so often, we'd come down to Dallas

759
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,060
 and just get wasted.

760
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,060
 We'd go to a place called the Lemon Tree Lounge.

761
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,840
 And you know, there's all kinds of stuff.

762
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,860
 There's women, there's men, there's booze, there's music.

763
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,940
 That ain't a good mix right there.

764
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,100
 And they're playing all this music.

765
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,300
 And I remember looking over in the bar mirror

766
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,860
 and seeing myself.

767
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,940
 All right.

768
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:54,720
 (congregation laughing)

769
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,720
 And I just looked at myself and everybody else.

770
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,800
 And I said, this is a bad deal right here.

771
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,420
 Somebody's gonna get shot.

772
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,560
 I just looked at it and I said,

773
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,960
 every time Josiah, I read that verse too,

774
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,720
 that's me at the Lemon Tree Lounge.

775
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,080
 This is madness.

776
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
 What does it accomplish?

777
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,080
 I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine

778
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,920
 while my mind was guiding me wisely.

779
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,060
 That means I got drunk and took notes.

780
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,640
 Are we having fun?

781
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,480
 No.

782
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,080
 To see what good there is.

783
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,800
 So we've tried intellectualism.

784
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,900
 We tried hedonism.

785
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,780
 How much drinking do you have to do?

786
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,360
 How much sex do you need to have?

787
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,720
 After a while, it's just old stuff.

788
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,440
 So he says, it didn't work.

789
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,160
 So now we go to our junior year.

790
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,120
 Verse four, we're gonna try materialism.

791
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,840
 We'll make a billion dollars and move to Dallas.

792
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:05,000
 And so I enlarge my works and build houses for myself,

793
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,120
 vineyards for myself, parks for myself.

794
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,660
 Verse six, water for myself,

795
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,920
 all the way down to where else?

796
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,120
 Let's see.

797
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,920
 Verse eight, collected for myself, silver and gold,

798
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,000
 the treasure of kings and many concubines.

799
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,880
 So I made all the money, all the pleasure

800
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,960
 and all the learning I could have.

801
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,920
 And verse nine, I became great and increased more.

802
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,560
 I was the greatest.

803
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,280
 Verse 10, all my eyes desired, I didn't refuse.

804
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,360
 My hands in verse 11, he says in verse 10,

805
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,680
 I didn't withhold my heart from any pleasure.

806
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,220
 My heart was pleased because of my labor.

807
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,920
 What that means, Josiah, is I did have pleasure

808
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,860
 clearing the land, building a park,

809
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,180
 building a house, planting vineyards.

810
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,140
 He said that was fun.

811
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,180
 It is fun to be like God and with opposable thumbs

812
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,300
 and radiuses and balls and socket,

813
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,820
 we can do all kinds of things and we can make things.

814
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,660
 That's fun.

815
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,480
 Remember when you were a little boy,

816
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
 they give you a Christmas present,

817
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,900
 throw the present away and play with the box.

818
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,180
 You remember that?

819
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,180
 Because you like creating.

820
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,240
 So Solomon says, it's great to create,

821
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,500
 but ultimately he says, there's no profit in them.

822
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,820
 He says in verse 12 and following,

823
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,980
 I've learned that it's better to be wise than an idiot.

824
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,980
 But in verse 14, one fate befalls them all.

825
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,100
 What's the one fate that befalls wise men

826
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,680
 and idiots alike?

827
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,520
 Death.

828
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,760
 I don't care who you are.

829
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,820
 You're gonna die.

830
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,540
 And then you're gonna leave it to your kids.

831
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,380
 God help you.

832
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,700
 And they're gonna put it on the curb

833
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,180
 'cause they want to jet ski.

834
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,220
 All right.

835
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,780
 So they're gonna sell all your precious stuff

836
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,740
 to get a tent when they travel.

837
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,740
 And so in verse 17, we've tried them all.

838
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,460
 Here's the conclusion.

839
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,540
 Verse 17, read that Josiah out loud.

840
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,540
 I hated life.

841
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,900
 Verse 18, read that Josiah.

842
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:25,760
 I hated my work.

843
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,400
 Verse 20, Josiah.

844
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:36,980
 I despaired.

845
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,680
 You see what the results was?

846
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,520
 I hated life.

847
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,140
 I hated all the work that I'd done.

848
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,760
 And I am despairing.

849
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,280
 Francis Schaeffer said, he's now suicidal.

850
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,480
 And Solomon says, I've been there.

851
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,720
 You're never gonna have the pleasure I had.

852
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,780
 You're never gonna have the money.

853
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,000
 You're never gonna have the knowledge.

854
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,940
 And I'm telling you right now,

855
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,520
 once you get through building and having fun,

856
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,460
 it goes into the ground, you die, and it's done.

857
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,760
 Grass covers you up.

858
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:13,620
 He said, man without God is suicidal, Solomon.

859
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:19,380
 And so in verse 24, and we conclude,

860
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,540
 he hasn't mentioned God, but once in passing.

861
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,240
 Now he's gonna give you a solution.

862
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,380
 Would y'all agree that he has shown you the problem?

863
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,300
 That's the mark of a good Koheleth.

864
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,180
 You show the problem and you show the solution.

865
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,740
 And so he says, look,

866
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,380
 now there's two interpretations to this,

867
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,980
 two translations that get to the same place.

868
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,900
 I'm gonna give them both to you.

869
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,700
 One is, there is nothing better for a man

870
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,820
 than to simply enjoy life.

871
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,780
 Eat and drink.

872
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,300
 Your labor is good.

873
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,020
 Enjoy your food, enjoy your company,

874
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:01,020
 enjoy your labor, because it's from the hand of,

875
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,820
 what's the last word?

876
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,780
 God.

877
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,820
 Solomon says in verse 25,

878
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,140
 "Who can eat and drink and have enjoyment without him?"

879
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,940
 He stops and he says, readers,

880
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,020
 you cannot enjoy life without God.

881
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,200
 In other words, he ends this text

882
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,240
 with the Westminster Confession.

883
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,420
 The chief end of man is to know God

884
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,420
 and to glorify him forever.

885
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,900
 Incidentally, the book is gonna end the same way.

886
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,900
 When all has been said, fear God, keep his commandments,

887
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,380
 this is the whole of man.

888
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,840
 We're gonna end the book with the Westminster Confession,

889
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,580
 with Adam in the garden.

890
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,780
 Without God, well, what Francis Schaeffer say,

891
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,900
 "When there is no absolute by which to judge society,

892
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,140
 "society is absolute."

893
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,620
 You're gonna discover through history,

894
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,600
 take it from an old man, man makes for a bad deity.

895
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,340
 He's not a good God.

896
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,540
 Man will screw it up every time.

897
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,060
 And so that's one interpretation,

898
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,940
 is that you cannot enjoy life without God.

899
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,580
 You better get him straight.

900
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,620
 Whenever you have kids, I have two of them,

901
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,780
 Terminator and Rambo, okay?

902
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,660
 (congregation laughing)

903
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,980
 My two boys.

904
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,940
 And I raised them as good as I could,

905
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,020
 but when they were four years old,

906
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,620
 they put their trust in Christ.

907
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,740
 With me and my wife, they prayed,

908
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,140
 one is a detective in Fort Worth,

909
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,460
 the other's in the secret service,

910
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,060
 they put on Kevlar and shoot people.

911
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,780
 All right, that's their job.

912
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,060
 But they know God, they'll shoot you well

913
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,500
 to the glory of God.

914
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,920
 (congregation laughing)

915
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,100
 They love their wives, they love their kids.

916
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,660
 So my boys are good boys.

917
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,140
 Now that you know God, do you know where you came from?

918
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,380
 Yeah, you know who you are?

919
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,700
 Yeah, you know where evil's from?

920
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,980
 Yeah, you know how it's taken away?

921
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,260
 Yeah, you know what your duty is?

922
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,860
 Yeah, you know where the universe is going?

923
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,620
 Yeah, you're cool, you're set right there.

924
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,980
 Now just fill in the gaps and learn stuff and enjoy life.

925
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:14,060
 So he says, without God, you're not gonna make it.

926
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,900
 The other interpretation is by a guy named Walt Kaiser,

927
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,400
 best Hebrew guy I've ever known.

928
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,740
 His interpretation is in verse 24,

929
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,020
 the word better should not be there.

930
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,780
 He said the word better shows up

931
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,940
 throughout the book of Ecclesiastes.

932
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,340
 It's nothing better for a man than to do this.

933
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,940
 He said in the Hebrew, the word better,

934
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,740
 right here is not there.

935
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,660
 That's why some of you have better in italics.

936
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,820
 It's added by the interpreter.

937
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,740
 And so he feels that it should say,

938
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,100
 there is nothing in a man

939
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:55,540
 to eat and drink and tell himself his labor is good.

940
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,540
 This I have seen is from the hand of God.

941
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,220
 He says that this is the greatest philosophical statement

942
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,060
 of the Bible.

943
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,820
 There is nothing within finite man to be an infinite

944
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,180
 by which he will understand life,

945
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,340
 enjoyment and his labor than God.

946
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:16,500
 If you don't know God, you cannot, verse 25,

947
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,260
 eat and drink and have joy.

948
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,180
 It's always going to be depressing.

949
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,100
 It's always going to be anxiety.

950
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,940
 You've gotta know God.

951
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,500
 I like that second interpretation.

952
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,900
 I believe he says, there is nothing for a human being

953
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,700
 to eat and drink and enjoy and tell himself his labor

954
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,060
 is good is from the hand of God,

955
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,380
 who can eat and who can have enjoyment without him.

956
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,500
 Without God, you're not gonna make it.

957
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,200
 In verse 26, and incidentally, Josiah,

958
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,420
 that's the first laborious time he uses the term God.

959
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,660
 He showed you without God, you're a dead man walking.

960
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,540
 With God, you're gonna make it.

961
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,700
 In verse 26, to a person good in his sight,

962
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,780
 he's given wisdom, divine wisdom, divine knowledge,

963
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,660
 and just thus joy.

964
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,380
 The sinner, he's given the task of gathering and collecting

965
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,540
 that God can give it to the one who is good in his sight,

966
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,580
 that God can save you and then God can guide your life.

967
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,660
 Without God, you're a dung beetle.

968
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,780
 You ever seen a dung beetle?

969
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,980
 A dung beetle just collects his own crap

970
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,300
 and takes it into the house.

971
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,060
 That's man without God.

972
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,660
 You're just a dung beetle.

973
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,500
 All right.

974
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,220
 Great title for this sermon.

975
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:32,220
 And so, there is the end of the book.

976
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,740
 When I was in college, I went to college,

977
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,620
 nobody in my family had ever been to college.

978
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,320
 I went to college on a scholarship at North Texas

979
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,320
 and I went through intellectualism, hedonism, materialism,

980
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,540
 and I reached the end of my tether

981
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,540
 and I did not know what I was gonna do.

982
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,340
 And I ran into one day, a campus crusader,

983
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:01,340
 came to my room in 1972 and he said to me,

984
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,580
 "I'm taking a survey, can I ask you a question?"

985
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,180
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, hurry up."

986
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,220
 And I'm trying to get out of the room.

987
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,600
 So I got out of the room, I went up to the elevator.

988
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,520
 "Can I ask you why we're standing at the elevator?"

989
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,360
 "Yeah, sure."

990
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,820
 Go ahead.

991
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:14,740
 What do you call yourself?

992
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,020
 Christian, Muslim, Hindu, what?

993
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:16,980
 I said, "I'm a Christian."

994
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,060
 I was raised Methodist in Waco.

995
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,820
 I said, "I'm a Christian."

996
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,060
 And he said, "What do you think a Christian is?"

997
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,060
 What a rude question.

998
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,980
 He said, "What do you think a Christian is?"

999
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,140
 And I said, "Somebody that keeps the 10 commandments."

1000
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:35,160
 And he just looked at me and he said,

1001
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,960
 "You think that's a Christian?"

1002
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,360
 Like I could be wrong.

1003
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,260
 I was a quarterback.

1004
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:49,680
 He said, "You think that's a Christian?"

1005
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,520
 And I said, "Yeah."

1006
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,640
 And about that time, the elevator goes,

1007
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,920
 ding, going down.

1008
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,020
 And so he just kind of left me going to hell

1009
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:56,860
 and didn't tell me.

1010
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,200
 (congregation laughing)

1011
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,300
 A couple of weeks later,

1012
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,060
 I picked up a magazine called "Athletes in Action."

1013
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,860
 They had a testimony in there of a guy named Terry Pape,

1014
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,740
 linebacker from Stanford.

1015
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,740
 I read his testimony so many times.

1016
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,700
 I knew the answer was in there,

1017
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,260
 but I couldn't understand it.

1018
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,220
 He talked about being lonely, aloof,

1019
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,180
 no meaning to life, took long walks at night,

1020
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,780
 reaching inside of himself, couldn't find anything,

1021
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,100
 heard the fact that God had made himself known.

1022
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,460
 His son was the central point of his word

1023
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,060
 who became one of us and died.

1024
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,020
 I mean, Jesus went to the nerve center of the problem.

1025
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,460
 I'll be a man and I'll die for what you did

1026
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,020
 and rise for what you didn't, and we can do an exchange.

1027
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,580
 And he said, "I heard that."

1028
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,780
 And I said, "Jesus, I've tried for 22 years

1029
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,620
 "and I failed.

1030
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,940
 "Come into my life and save me."

1031
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,900
 The guy's name was Terry Pape.

1032
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,100
 I read it so many times that I memorized what he had said.

1033
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,380
 I ran into the guy at Dallas Seminary in the library

1034
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,660
 and I said, "Hey, you don't know me,

1035
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,100
 "but you helped get me saved."

1036
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,020
 And so I read that testimony, but it didn't do anything.

1037
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,000
 A short while later, I go into my room.

1038
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,700
 I've got this roommate that's 6'7" by 270

1039
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,340
 from Houston, Cypress Fairbanks.

1040
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,500
 There's a little guy that's about 2'1", okay?

1041
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,460
 (congregation laughing)

1042
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,060
 And he's talking to him and I looked at him

1043
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,260
 and I sat on my bed and my roommate said,

1044
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,060
 "This guy's name's Jerry,

1045
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,420
 "and he's talking to me about God."

1046
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,580
 And I'm thinking, "You let him in?"

1047
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,300
 Yeah, because he was just going door to door.

1048
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,140
 Hello, I'm Jerry Cook.

1049
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,380
 I'd like to tell you about the person that Jesus Christ,

1050
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,820
 thank you.

1051
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,740
 Hi, I'm Jerry Cook.

1052
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,100
 And for some reason, my roommate let him in.

1053
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:43,940
 And I don't know why he did

1054
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,940
 because Cartoon Carnival's on

1055
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,140
 and that mean he had to turn it off, all right.

1056
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,140
 My roommate didn't miss Cartoon Carnival, okay.

1057
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,580
 And so he's sitting in there and Jerry's talking to him.

1058
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,420
 And I listened over his shoulder.

1059
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,100
 He's not even looking at me.

1060
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,660
 And he says to my roommate, "What are you?

1061
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,780
 "Are you a Jew?

1062
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,620
 "You're a Christian?

1063
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,780
 "You're a Hindu?

1064
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,620
 "You're a Muslim?

1065
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,700
 "What are you?"

1066
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,160
 Same as the guy asked me.

1067
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,180
 My roommate says, "I'm a Christian."

1068
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,180
 And he says, "What is a Christian?"

1069
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,980
 Deja vu, this is happening again.

1070
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,300
 He says, "What is a Christian?"

1071
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,260
 And my roommate says,

1072
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,760
 "It's somebody that keeps the 10 commandments."

1073
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,900
 And I'm like mouthing the word.

1074
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:31,820
 Now I got the answer.

1075
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,700
 And he looks at my roommate

1076
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,500
 and he could have said a number of things.

1077
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,860
 Am I going too long here, Josiah?

1078
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,820
 Am I okay?

1079
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,020
 We got people going to hell

1080
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,020
 and I'd like to tell them how not to go.

1081
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,340
 (congregation laughing)

1082
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,840
 (congregation applauding)

1083
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,340
 Where was I?

1084
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:59,720
 He says to me, he could have said to my roommate,

1085
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,860
 "Name 'em."

1086
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,460
 And we'd have been in trouble.

1087
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,900
 Or he could have said, "Find 'em."

1088
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,100
 All right, we'd have really been in trouble.

1089
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,220
 All he said was this.

1090
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,880
 And by this time, I'm not reading my book.

1091
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,400
 I'm listening 'cause I'm thinking the hound of heaven,

1092
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,080
 somebody's after me.

1093
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,120
 'Cause I knew it wasn't Rex.

1094
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,160
 I knew he was going to hell.

1095
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,720
 All right, so I didn't even count that.

1096
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:28,520
 This guy says, he just looks at my roommate and he says,

1097
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,560
 "You keep 'em.

1098
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,640
 "You keep 'em."

1099
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,120
 My roommate was silent.

1100
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,520
 Habakkuk 2, the Lord is in his holy temple.

1101
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,360
 Let all the earth keep silent.

1102
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,100
 God has shut up all in disobedience.

1103
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,240
 My roommate couldn't say a word and I couldn't either.

1104
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,880
 And then this guy just ground the knife in.

1105
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,280
 He said, "When I say keep 'em,

1106
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,800
 "I don't mean just mean the peaks.

1107
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,220
 "I mean the valleys.

1108
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,980
 "You hadn't just murdered anybody.

1109
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,180
 "You've never called anybody a name.

1110
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,140
 "You're not just an adulterer.

1111
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,380
 "You've never looked at a woman with lust.

1112
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,460
 "You're not just a bad kid.

1113
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,760
 "You've never ever disobeyed your parents.

1114
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,980
 "You've never lied.

1115
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,920
 "You've never coveted anything ahead of God Almighty.

1116
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,600
 "You've sought Him with all your heart."

1117
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,600
 My roommate was silent and I was silent.

1118
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,300
 And I was just looking at his back.

1119
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,000
 And then he said to my roommate words

1120
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,080
 that all of the universe opened right here.

1121
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,700
 He said to my roommate,

1122
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,000
 "God didn't give the 10 commandments

1123
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,480
 "primarily for us to keep.

1124
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,820
 "He gave them as boundaries, but primarily,

1125
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,980
 "He gave 'em to show us His nature

1126
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:49,560
 "and that we could not keep them, that we are guilty."

1127
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,620
 And he said to my roommate,

1128
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,060
 "That's why the Bible doesn't end

1129
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,980
 "with the 10 commandments.

1130
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,380
 "It goes on to people that broke 'em

1131
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,340
 "and then His Son came to die.

1132
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,980
 "That He lived perfectly under the law.

1133
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,340
 "He died to the punishment of the law

1134
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,100
 "and He rose from the dead.

1135
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,180
 "So our victory was won by Him.

1136
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,900
 "And by receiving Him," he said,

1137
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,160
 "It's not just enough to know this.

1138
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,880
 "You have to receive Him into your heart

1139
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,200
 "and you personally with God have gotta have an encounter.

1140
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,480
 "You and God have gotta have an encounter.

1141
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,740
 "And you've gotta either accept this gift or reject Him.

1142
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,340
 "And if you accept Him,

1143
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,920
 "He's gonna turn your life upside down

1144
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,820
 "and you're gonna have to explain it

1145
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,500
 "and stand before the world with that knowledge."

1146
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,860
 And then he left.

1147
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:42,240
 My roommate became a bouncer in a Houston topless bar.

1148
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,780
 He was a defensive end.

1149
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,300
 Okay.

1150
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,500
 It hit me and I went out of there

1151
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,580
 and I thought, "If that's not true, it oughta be."

1152
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,180
 Because I found nothing like that.

1153
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,800
 And I, make a long story short,

1154
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,820
 God brought me to the end of my rope

1155
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,500
 and I got home, I knelt by that bed,

1156
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,920
 locked the door and got on my knees.

1157
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,920
 And I said, "God, I have tried for 22 years to find meaning

1158
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,220
 "and I can't find it."

1159
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,900
 I've never, 'cause I can never remember, Josiah,

1160
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,740
 ever in my life repenting.

1161
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:24,740
 I can never remember feeling guilty before a holy God.

1162
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,740
 I felt bad I got caught sometimes.

1163
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,360
 My conscience had bothered me.

1164
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,820
 But I never, ever before a holy God said,

1165
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,020
 "I am in a heap of trouble and I need you to save me."

1166
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,180
 I would pray when we were gonna play Arkansas.

1167
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,020
 Okay, our father who art in heaven.

1168
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,220
 (congregation laughing)

1169
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,920
 But that's all.

1170
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,220
 And I died.

1171
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,260
 I didn't know I got heaven out of the deal.

1172
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,000
 I just wanted to die and give my life to somebody else.

1173
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,820
 The next morning, something was changed.

1174
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,060
 I was like a baby that had come out of the womb.

1175
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,620
 Everything looked different.

1176
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,860
 I opened the Bible, it made sense.

1177
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,380
 Shortly after that, I tore up my knee,

1178
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,100
 missed my senior year.

1179
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,980
 They brought in a coach named Hayden Fry, anybody?

1180
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,820
 College Hall of Fame.

1181
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,340
 And I thought, this is why God let my knee get injured,

1182
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,760
 so I can play my fifth year and be Heisman Trophy winner.

1183
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,600
 God is good.

1184
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,420
 (congregation laughing)

1185
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,020
 And Hayden Fry called me into his office.

1186
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,340
 He said, "Tommy, you're a fifth year senior."

1187
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,420
 Yes, sir, I am.

1188
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,780
 "Why'd you wanna come back your fifth year?"

1189
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,660
 Well, frankly, I wanted to play for guys like you.

1190
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,020
 He said, "Well, we are flattered.

1191
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:40,020
 "However, we're gonna lose this year

1192
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,940
 "and I can't lose with a fifth year senior."

1193
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,700
 And so Tommy, Arriva Dirty,

1194
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,860
 Chili Con Carne,

1195
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,220
 ciao,

1196
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,620
 bye-bye.

1197
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,740
 And I got cut.

1198
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,140
 Shortly thereafter, I started working

1199
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,020
 at Louisville High School, getting my student teaching in.

1200
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,420
 This guy comes to me, he says, "Hey, you're a Christian?"

1201
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,240
 Yeah, I was a coach.

1202
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,780
 "Could you come talk to my FCA group?"

1203
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,180
 16 kids.

1204
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,100
 I got up, I had it written down what I was gonna say.

1205
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,620
 It was called God's Plan.

1206
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:17,620
 And so I said, "Hey, it's good to be here talking to y'all."

1207
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:22,140
 And I talked about God's love, man, sin, Christ, death.

1208
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:22,980
 When I finished, I said,

1209
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,420
 "I don't guess any of y'all wanna be Christians."

1210
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,180
 Eight of 'em said we do.

1211
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,420
 Later on, they said, "Could you speak to the school?"

1212
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,220
 And I said, "God, you'll be sorry."

1213
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:36,500
 I was Barney Fife with one bullet, all right.

1214
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,300
 I'll do it.

1215
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,260
 And God got me up there and I shared my faith

1216
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:48,020
 and the place went silent and God blessed His Word.

1217
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,500
 And I found out you could get paid for this.

1218
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,540
 And here I am.

1219
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,620
 My point is,

1220
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,540
 God has something.

1221
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,460
 He broke me up with my girlfriend, dated her four years.

1222
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,100
 There was somebody, she much better off now,

1223
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,780
 but God brought me to the woman

1224
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,180
 He wanted me to have the kids

1225
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,940
 and He has led me all the way.

1226
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:17,620
 So if you died right now, stood before God,

1227
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,740
 and He said, "Why should I let you in my heaven?"

1228
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,940
 What would you answer?

1229
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,560
 If your answer is anything other than Jesus,

1230
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,820
 you better stop because before you can go on to anything,

1231
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:33,220
 you've got to settle this issue of you, God, and eternity.

1232
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,540
 What's it gonna be?

1233
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,660
 You still get salvation the way Adam did.

1234
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,160
 You eat from the tree.

1235
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,220
 You're a cross runner.

1236
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,580
 That's the tree.

1237
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:46,060
 You go to it and you receive Christ.

1238
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,740
 He that opens the door, I'll come in

1239
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,900
 and I'll sup with Him and hymn with me.

1240
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,700
 Father in heaven, I thank you for this book

1241
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,160
 and it has laid the foundation right here.

1242
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,620
 Man without God is in the desert

1243
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:06,020
 and money and pleasure and intelligence

1244
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:10,740
 is not gonna satisfy us.

1245
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,860
 That there is nothing in a man to enjoy life

1246
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,300
 and say his labor is good.

1247
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,220
 This is from the hand of God.

1248
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:24,220
 Adam must know God before he knows anything else.

1249
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,860
 And these young men and women, I have been where they are,

1250
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,980
 I've sat in these chairs,

1251
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,700
 and there's a whole lot of messages going out around them.

1252
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,700
 And none of them are about the infinite personal God.

1253
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,280
 They are all applauding the next generations,

1254
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,040
 discovering something that man has not found since Adam,

1255
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,980
 and that is eternal life.

1256
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:53,980
 May this very night, you have a come to Jesus meeting

1257
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,220
 in the heart of these young studs

1258
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,300
 and you would guide them all of their lives

1259
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,280
 into the blessedness of knowing God.

1260
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,680
 In whose name we pray, amen.

1261
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,680
 - Thank you. - Good.
