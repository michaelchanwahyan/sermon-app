[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:26.160]   All right, well, hey, welcome everybody in the room, everybody
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.600]   tuning in online.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.720]   And at the 14--
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.760]   thank you--
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.360]   PortsLive locations, we are continuing this series.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.360]   We're all freaking out, and why we don't have to,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.720]   talking about really crucial topics of mental health,
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.840]   anxiety, soon depression, stress,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.080]   and what God has to say about these crucial topics.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.680]   So tonight, we're going to look at what
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.200]   I think is one of the key contributors
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.080]   to the experience of being robbed of peace
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.120]   and experiencing anxiety and stress and panic.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.560]   And to do so, I'm going to start by showing y'all a picture of what
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.680]   was one of the first clocks in Europe.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.240]   Now, you look at that, and you wonder, where is the clock?
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.700]   Because it doesn't look like there's any part of that clock.
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.320]   This was one of the first clock towers ever erected,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.400]   or the first clock tower ever erected in Milan, Italy.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.620]   Shout out to everybody who got a big Milan porch group out there.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.760]   And that's not true at all.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.800]   But this clock was erected and was transformational
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.440]   in the relationship that the West or Europe and eventually America
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.200]   would have with time itself.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.920]   But here's what's crazy about this clock.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.720]   Like I said, there's no face.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.680]   There's no dial.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.680]   It was a clock that was programmed to beat every hour.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.560]   And the number of times that it beat throughout the city of Milan
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.360]   would indicate the hour of day that it was.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.640]   So at 1 o'clock in the morning, it would beat one time.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.400]   At midnight, it would be 24 times.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.480]   At 2, it would beat 2.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.040]   At 6, it would beat 6.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.800]   And here's why this was transformational.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.280]   Prior to this, and eventually after it was erected in Milan,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.800]   the clock spread like wildfire, and specifically
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   a public clock in town spread all throughout Europe
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.600]   and became a normal part of everyday life.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.440]   But imagine how transformative that would have been.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.920]   Prior to this time, the relationship people had with time
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.400]   was all based around the sun.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.960]   In other words, sun goes up, time to get up and start the day.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.480]   Sun goes down, not exactly sure what time it is.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.000]   Is it 7?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.400]   Is it 8?
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.200]   It doesn't matter.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.160]   There's no electricity.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.440]   We're all going to bed anyways.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   And the clock introduced a new relationship
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.080]   where no longer was society or humanity governed by the sun.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.480]   One writer wrote that it was an act of rebellion by saying,
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.760]   we are no longer living underneath the jurisdiction
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.560]   of the sun.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.520]   Now we have been liberated.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.000]   And now if we want to get up and meet at 6 in the morning,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.360]   we can go meet because we got six drumbeats that just happened.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.040]   And that began to spread like crazy.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.880]   And the pluses and minuses of living
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.760]   in a world that can be governed by the 9 to 5, 24 hours a day,
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.600]   7 days a week began to be a part of everyday normal life.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.520]   And then fast forward a few centuries later
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.080]   and something was introduced called the light bulb.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.200]   And our relationship previously to the light bulb,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.400]   even though the clock was around, we know it's 7 o'clock,
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.720]   but you light a fire and that's basically what you do.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.640]   Everybody's camping essentially for all of life.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.280]   And then we get something called electricity and the light bulb.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.320]   And we're able to say, man, just give the middle finger basically
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   to the sun and say, we don't even need you anymore.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.760]   We can work all the way into the night.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.680]   And society and culture continued
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.160]   to get faster and faster and work longer and longer.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.560]   And the modern age began.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.680]   And we live in a time in world history
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.840]   that is relatively new, speaking,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.080]   where our understanding and having a clock is just
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.040]   a normal part of everyday life and electricity
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.480]   and doing things into the evening.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.000]   I mean, the porch could not have existed 100 years ago
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.040]   because or 150 years ago because of electricity.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.960]   It's pretty crazy to think about.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.920]   And yet all of that transformation
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.640]   has also increased something in our society called stress,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.480]   where despite the fact that now the blessing of being
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.240]   able to work and work and work has also come with the curse
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.840]   of being able to work and work and work
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.680]   and take all of the side effects that come along with that.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.480]   America as a country is one of the most overworked nations
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.000]   on Earth.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.800]   If there was a gold medal for most rested,
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.040]   America would not come close.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.720]   There are more unused vacation days for the average American
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.400]   than any other country on Earth.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.200]   86% of men and 67% of women work over 40 hours a week.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.360]   It is one of the most highly overworked group
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.120]   on the planet that takes the least amount of vacations
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.680]   and experience some of the highest levels of anxiety,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.800]   stress, and depression.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.300]   Here's something further that's crazy.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.480]   This was crazy, man.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.080]   Just give them this for free.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.960]   Until about the 1920s, the term that we use,
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.800]   if you talk to your friends, probably today,
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.560]   and you ask like, man, how's your day?
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.400]   How's life going?
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.900]   You're catching up.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.040]   They'll be like, good, just under a lot of stress.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.560]   Did you know that phrase would not have made sense
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.800]   100 years ago?
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.560]   I'm talking like the beginning of the war in '20s.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.280]   Nobody would have understood what do you even mean
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.440]   I'm really stressed?
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.320]   Why do I say that?
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.740]   Because prior to the 1920s, the use of the word stress
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.680]   never was used to describe an emotional experience
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.080]   or a person's life or a season that they were in.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.960]   It wasn't personal.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.160]   It was always physics.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.120]   In other words, stress would have been a term
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.800]   that was used in the world of physics
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.040]   when someone would see maybe a metal beam
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.340]   or see some object having weight placed on it
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.660]   and a beam would have been stressed out
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.300]   when it reached the breaking point.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.720]   Does that make sense?
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   And it's almost as though somebody saw a beam
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.960]   like, man, it's about to snap,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.840]   and I feel like that's my life.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.920]   And they began to say, I feel so stressed out,
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.520]   and it caught on like wildfire,
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.160]   and now we say it all the time.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.120]   You, of course, understand.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.160]   Somebody says I'm stressed, you're like, oh, man, same.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.280]   Who's not?
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.880]   'Cause we understand.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.860]   And yet, one of the key contributors
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.300]   to you having anxiety or key things
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.320]   that will inhibit you from experiencing the peace
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.740]   that God wants to mark your life
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.920]   is stress, being overwhelmed, panicked.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.720]   And so we're gonna look at some of the truths
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.980]   that God has given in a story
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.940]   that was recorded thousands of years ago
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.960]   because God is passionate.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.220]   He does not want that to mark your life.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.480]   He wants you to experience peace,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.200]   this ability to catch your breath,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.560]   to not feel like, man, I'm constantly overwhelmed,
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.400]   but to feel peace.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.360]   And we're gonna do so by looking at a story
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.280]   that points to some of the sources of stress
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.700]   that are still common today,
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.020]   some of the side effects that,
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.460]   anytime stress is present in our life,
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.780]   are often present, and then the solution
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.000]   to experiencing a life that's not marked by stress,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.680]   but by peace through our relationship with Christ.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.780]   So we're gonna look in Luke, chapter 10.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.240]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open to Luke, chapter 10.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.400]   It's a very famous story.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.820]   If you grew up in church, you probably heard it,
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.400]   but you may have misunderstood, actually,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.360]   the profound teaching Jesus gives us.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.400]   It's Jesus's interaction with two ladies,
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.600]   sisters named Mary and Martha,
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.640]   who were two of Jesus's closest friends.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.200]   They had another sibling named Lazarus.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.120]   And Mary and Martha were two disciples
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.620]   who knew Jesus, ran with him.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.200]   And in the interaction they have with Jesus,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.480]   we're given some of the glimpses into our own experience
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.440]   and interaction with stress
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.620]   and what Jesus has to say about it.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.120]   So I'm gonna read through this story really quick,
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.680]   and then we'll point through the sources,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.200]   side effects, and solution.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.840]   It says this in verse 38.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:49.200]   As Jesus and his disciples were on their way,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.140]   he came to a village where a woman named Martha
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.380]   opened up her home to him, invited him in.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.880]   She had a sister called Mary,
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.880]   who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.340]   But Martha was distracted by all the preparations
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.380]   that had to be made.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.940]   She came to him, Jesus sitting in the living room,
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.060]   all the disciples around, Mary sitting there,
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.540]   and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.220]   "has left me to do all the work by myself?
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.220]   "Tell her to help me."
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.780]   "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered,
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.940]   "you are worried and upset,
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.600]   "or troubled," your translation may have,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.900]   "about many things, but few things are needed,
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.040]   "or indeed only one.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.040]   "Mary has chosen what is better,
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.840]   "and it will not be taken away from her."
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.560]   So pretty simple story.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.240]   Jesus goes into his town, this village.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.280]   There's a woman named Martha.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.480]   She owns a home.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.360]   She invites Jesus in, and she's gonna whip something up.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.640]   She's getting hummus and chopping up tomatoes
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.160]   and doing whatever she's doing in the kitchen,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.960]   and she begins to feel overwhelmed.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.900]   And Mary, her freeloader sister,
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.820]   'cause it's not Mary's house, it's Martha's house.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.940]   Martha's paying the mortgage, and Mary's just in there,
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.420]   sitting like a freeloader at the feet of Jesus,
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.140]   and she comes to Jesus and says,
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.660]   "Man, hook your sister up.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.860]   "You're just gonna leave me out here,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.980]   "make me chop up all of the olives in here by myself?
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.100]   "Can you help me out and tell my sister to come help me?"
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.440]   And Jesus says, "Man, you are overwhelmed
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.420]   "and worried and stressed,"
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.540]   and he addresses something going on on the inside.
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.060]   And he gets to something incredibly profound
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.160]   that we'll cover here in a second,
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.480]   but the first I did wanna talk about
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.560]   is some of the sources of stress,
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.240]   because the sources of stress that Martha exhibits
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.880]   are some of the same sources that we all exhibit.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.720]   I mean, you gotta feel it.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.060]   Like, here's my hot take on Martha.
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.240]   Martha gets a bad rap.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.720]   I think if you lived in the first century
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.440]   and you were a guy, you wanted to date and marry Martha.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.680]   If Chris Harrison was around,
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.280]   well, I guess he's not around anymore anyways,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.600]   but if Chris Harrison or Bachelor was around back then,
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.880]   and they were looking for a bachelorette,
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.720]   I think Martha is at the top of the list.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.140]   She's a go-getter, she's responsible, she owns a house.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.340]   Mary is some hippie on the floor,
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.960]   and Martha's in there cooking dinner.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.660]   She's making a meal.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.000]   I mean, this is a girl that there's a lot to respect about.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.100]   And yet, with all that respectability also came
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.260]   that she was carrying a lot of stress,
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.380]   particularly even stress that was attacking
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.220]   and impacting her relationship with Jesus,
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.780]   the Son of God sitting in her living room.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.580]   And so I wanna walk through a few of the sources of stress,
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.660]   because I think they're so parallel to the same things
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.940]   that are sources of stress in our life,
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.860]   that if we're gonna experience more freedom from it,
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.940]   I believe God tonight wants to deepen
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.640]   the amount of peace in your heart.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.900]   But to do so, we've gotta address some of the sources
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.140]   that are filling our heart with stress.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.100]   Well, the first source of stress is she had stress
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.500]   from all she had to get done.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.540]   Let me read the text again, 'cause this is our life.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.220]   But Martha was distracted by all the preparations
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.180]   that had to be made.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.900]   Who said they had to be made?
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.260]   Jesus, we're not told Jesus commanded,
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.440]   "Hey, Martha, I want you to go in there
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.960]   "and make that favorite dish, a little soup.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.940]   "If you wouldn't mind, bring me a tub of Chico as well."
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.620]   We're not told he said any of that stuff.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.740]   We're told that Martha just said, "Jesus is coming over."
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.020]   She feels the all that has to be done,
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.400]   pressure on her life, that I have to do this.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.460]   I have to get something ready and the guys are coming in
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.540]   and I gotta make something special.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.540]   I mean, it's Jesus, can't just give him fish and loaves.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.560]   That's just an everyday meal.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.100]   Gotta whip up something good.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.820]   And she begins to build into this pressure
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.300]   of all that had to be done.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.460]   We're not told that anything had to be done.
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.020]   But this is the same stress source
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.800]   that impacts so much of our life.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.180]   Where I can find myself going, "Man, I have to do this.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.020]   "I have to do this."
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.060]   Or you can find yourself believing,
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.720]   "Man, I have to go to that happy hour
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.620]   "if I'm gonna get in a good relationship with my boss.
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.380]   "Oh man, I have to be on social media
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.900]   "in order to have some interactions,
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.360]   "keep up with people from high school.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.660]   "I have to start a side hustle,
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.220]   "probably Etsy, in order to keep up.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.620]   "I have to be on dating apps in order to find a relationship
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.540]   "where I'm gonna be the cat lady for forever.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.260]   "I have to be, I have to be, I have to be.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.460]   "I gotta go to church, have to get in a small group,
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.220]   "have to pay more bills, have to get a new car."
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.700]   When you don't have to do any of that.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.980]   Or we just fall victim to this, "Oh, I have to, I have to."
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:16.980]   Who said you had to?
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.560]   If anything, you get to.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.120]   But you're gonna experience stress when you live in this,
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.220]   "Oh no, I have to, I have to, I have to.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.000]   "I have to make sure that it's my friend's birthday.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.560]   "I have to make sure that I send a message
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.660]   "of it's happy birthday, I have to, I have to."
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.780]   And Martha fell into that little whisper,
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.780]   "You have to, you have to, you have to."
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.860]   Which anytime is present and acted on
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.700]   just increases stress inside of our life.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.640]   A friend of mine this week said,
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.860]   "Instagram is like a living to-do list for me."
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.420]   I thought this was brilliant.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.940]   And by that, she meant, "I go on there
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.960]   "and I am confronted with the things that I need to do
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.940]   "that I wasn't even thinking that I needed to do."
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.940]   Here's what I mean.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.900]   I get on there and somebody posts their picture
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.240]   of their engagement and I'm like,
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.100]   "Oh man, add to the subconscious to-do list,
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.440]   "find a boyfriend or just a guy.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.720]   "Add to the to-do list when I see someone's car,
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.280]   "man, my car is total garbage.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.140]   "Or when I see someone's vacation,
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.900]   "add to the to-do list, make more money
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.640]   "so that I can go on vacations,
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.620]   "that it just feeds this, feeds this, have to."
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.900]   And like Martha, anytime that's present,
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.240]   it's gonna just fuel stress.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.140]   There are a few things you have to,
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.260]   there's a lot of things you get to
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.220]   and hit the pressure relief.
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.980]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.260]   Another source is the idea that it all depends on me.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.300]   Martha was operating underneath this mentality of,
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.400]   man, it all depends on me, it all depends on me.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.140]   I mean, she could have gone into Jesus.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.260]   What's crazy is like three chapters earlier before this,
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.880]   Jesus takes a kid's Lunchable
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.580]   and he turns two fish and a few loaves
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.820]   into enough to feed 5,000 people.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.300]   I mean, previously, he'd already turned water into wine.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.540]   Imagine if Martha was like,
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.960]   "Look, hey, Jesus, you didn't really give me a lot of time.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.680]   "There's no clocks here, so we wouldn't have known anyways.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.740]   "But point being, how about we do that water into wine thing
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.860]   "or the fish and loaves thing
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.140]   "and you multiply it to feed the boys?
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.120]   "'Cause mama ain't got time right now."
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.780]   And she could have had everything that she needed.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.340]   But she bought into this mentality of,
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.700]   man, I need to do it on my own, it all depends on me.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.420]   Another source of stress we see from Martha
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.980]   is she was distracted.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.420]   She was distracted.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.840]   That's what the text says in verse 40.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.820]   Just like that phone is distracted right now.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.340]   She was distracted.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.180]   What do I mean?
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.840]   The word that's translated for distracted
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.740]   is to be pulled in many directions.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.740]   It was actually an ancient form of torture, French torture,
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.700]   an execution that was called death by distraction.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.780]   And it was a medieval practice where they would tie ropes
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.780]   around each four limbs.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.700]   So rope on your leg, each leg, rope on each arm,
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.460]   and then they would tie those ropes to horses
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.460]   and have the horses run in four different directions
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.220]   in order to have death by distraction, being pulled apart.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.600]   And that same idea is still relevant today
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.520]   where distraction and being pulled
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.260]   in every different direction
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.700]   can bring death into our lives.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.060]   Death with relationships.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.140]   Death in your ability to be present with other people.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.080]   Death in your intimacy with God.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.540]   That there still can be distraction,
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.820]   and Martha was distracted with all that she needed
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.800]   to get done.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.260]   It wasn't even sinful things.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.700]   Like this is what's really important.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.620]   You can experience a level of distraction
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.620]   that impacts your relationship with God in a negative way,
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.900]   and it's not even bad things.
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.980]   You're not choosing between, hey, today should I go
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.060]   commit armed robbery or go to church?
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.020]   It's just being bombarded with a bunch of distractions
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.740]   which right now you can't even focus on what I'm saying
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.540]   because you're bombarded with all the things,
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.980]   emails you may not have sent,
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.580]   or what somebody may have liked or commented on a post
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.160]   that you had, and it's just fueling distraction.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.060]   It's probably never been easier thanks to the iPhone.
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.740]   2011 or 2007, Steve Jobs created a device
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.620]   that transformed or has transformed our world
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.340]   as much as the printing press did in 1490,
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.040]   where now we live with portable computers
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.380]   that bombard us with information,
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.780]   and part of it is amazing.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.500]   Like you can be sitting right now where you're at
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.940]   and order something from Amazon,
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.980]   and it will beat your house by the time you get there.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.820]   You wanna know the best sushi place in town?
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.740]   Wonder No More.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.300]   There's an app called Yelp.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.620]   Fastest way to get home?
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.460]   Waze app.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.420]   Got you all day long.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.340]   Whatever you wanna know, what are the symptoms of measles
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.600]   or the black plague?
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.100]   Check out WebMD, it's got it.
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.120]   And yet at the benefit of all that information,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.340]   it's also study after study showing
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.140]   it is impacting our physiological stress levels.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.260]   Heart rates, ability to sleep
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.500]   are all being negatively impacted.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.520]   The average young adult, one study showed,
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.520]   touches their phone between 2,700 and 4,000 times a day.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.400]   You're asleep for eight of those hours, hopefully.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.020]   Do the math.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.420]   It's just touching, swiping, clicking.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.420]   And this incredible gift has also come
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.260]   at an incredible ability, or with an incredible ability,
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.500]   to distract our ability to be present.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.340]   So I wanna do something
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.500]   that you probably have not done in a long time.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.100]   I want you to take your phone right now, take it out.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.940]   Everybody take their phone out, okay?
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.060]   Lift it up.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.240]   All of you rule followers doing it,
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.780]   the ones who are not rule followers,
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.860]   the ones that are not doing it,
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.220]   take your phone out right now, got it?
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.200]   Okay, I want you to bring 'em up to the stage.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.460]   We're gonna give 'em, no, I'm just kidding.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.960]   I want you to take your phone.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.260]   I want you to turn it off.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.220]   I want you to say,
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.400]   "Man, this thing's not my master for 20 minutes."
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.780]   And half of you are gonna do it,
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.100]   the other half are gonna show and prove my point
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.060]   that it is your master.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.260]   So I want you to take it right now.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.240]   And you haven't done this, you may not have ever done this.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.620]   So if you have an iPhone, I can walk you through it.
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.220]   You push this button and this button, and you slide it off.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.380]   If you have an Android, you are dismissed.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.020]   And I'm totally kidding, it's a joke.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.700]   It's a joke.
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.500]   I love the Android people.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.940]   Don't email, it's a total joke.
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.940]   Can't email on an Android though, I feel like I'm safe.
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.140]   But the point being, turn off your phone.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.020]   What am I doing, I'm roasting Android people?
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.100]   And for the next 20 minutes, 20 minutes,
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.500]   look at me right now, 'cause half you guys,
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.020]   or a third of you, you still haven't done it,
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:36.980]   and you're like, "No, I'm not gonna do it,
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.260]   "I wanna keep checking TikTok."
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.060]   Turn it off for 20 minutes.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.340]   And you'll experience more peace,
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.460]   and I'll tell you why at the end.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.780]   Which is for the next handful of minutes,
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.620]   and I know what you're thinking,
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.900]   what if there's an emergency?
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.860]   Our tech team is gonna keep their phones on,
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.180]   so if we get bombed by China, they're gonna let us know.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.140]   Or whoever, I'm gonna get another email for that,
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:02.980]   good grief.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.580]   And everything's gonna be okay.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.300]   Everything's gonna be okay.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.720]   But that ability to be somewhere,
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.140]   and be constantly bombarded,
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.740]   where you're even trying to read the Bible app,
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.060]   and you're getting texts and notifications,
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.500]   and it is pulling your attention in different directions.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.880]   And just like Martha, it is creating stress and anxiety,
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.560]   and a low-grade anxiety.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.220]   One study said that the constant influx of information
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.180]   is what is triggering and keeps us in a constant state
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.580]   of experiencing a low-grade anxiety at all times.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.380]   That we were not made to be constantly bombarded
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.940]   with potential for information.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.620]   The third source that we see from her is fear.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.820]   Number three source of stress is fear.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.300]   And if you take notes on your phone, don't take notes,
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.500]   just keep it there, don't turn it back on.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.540]   You little phone addict, you, you keep it where it is.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.460]   But the third thing that she has is fear.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.660]   That Jesus says, hey, you're worried and you're anxious
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.180]   about many things, you're upset,
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.580]   you're troubled about many things.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.100]   Just like her, stress was driven by fear,
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.660]   a lot of our stress is driven by fear.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.100]   What do I mean?
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:16.360]   Like we can overwork ourself and feel like,
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.980]   I need to be successful.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.340]   I need to be seen as somebody that people look at
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.320]   and go, wow, he's amazing.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.140]   And so I let that drive or that desire to be seen some way
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.260]   by other people drive me to the place where I work so much.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.940]   I'm constantly looking for deals.
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.100]   I'm constantly starting another side hustle.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:38.100]   I'm constantly devoted to building my accomplishment list,
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.180]   which is driven by a fear of not being seen a certain way.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.680]   A fear of being left behind is another one.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.700]   Or a fear of not keeping up with everyone else in our life,
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.260]   of relationships, of getting married,
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.140]   of having children, of buying a home.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.620]   That fear can creep in and create an angst of,
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.440]   oh my goodness, I need to do more.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.100]   And it's fear, just like with Martha,
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.460]   that was driving her to please or get approval.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.820]   That fear of not being enough is often what contributes
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.500]   to our stress.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.700]   And we're gonna walk through the solution.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.220]   I'm just setting up the conversation of all these things
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.700]   that can drive so much of the stress that we carry around.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.720]   I remember talking to a friend of mine who was in ministry
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.060]   and just like with any job, if you're passionate about it
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.300]   and you like it, it can be challenging to run
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.380]   at a sustainable pace.
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.740]   And I remember talking to him, he's older,
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.260]   he's farther down the road.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:36.260]   And I just said, man, how do you maintain healthy boundaries
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.880]   and also take on responsibilities and do it all?
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.240]   And he said something that I'll never forget.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.380]   Asked him that question, we're talking on the phone.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.200]   It was like silence for just a second.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.580]   Said, I'm gonna tell you the answer.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.280]   I need you to listen very closely.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:55.520]   You become okay with letting everyone down.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   There's gonna be people that are gonna think,
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.440]   well, he should have called me on my birthday
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.720]   or should have come to that party
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.440]   or he should have worked later
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.560]   or I wonder what he's doing this weekend
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.060]   and why he didn't come here.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.640]   There's gonna be people for the rest of your life
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.900]   that are not gonna understand you,
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.360]   that are not gonna know everything that you're going through.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.780]   They're gonna put expectations
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.940]   that they never even verbalize on you.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.840]   And you gotta come to the place where you say,
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.280]   I don't live for everyone else's approval
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.720]   because if I do, I'm fighting a battle I'll never win.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.000]   I live for God's approval.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.080]   And so at the end of the day,
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.040]   I'm gonna stand before him and say,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   I've tried to be faithful and handle
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.540]   and do everything I can.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.120]   But if I live for a life
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.260]   that doesn't ever disappoint someone,
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.160]   it's never gonna happen.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.480]   And so you've gotta die to the idol of approval of people,
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.120]   the fear of letting someone down.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.160]   It'll just drive you to stress.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.160]   Finally, all of that drives us to a life
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.000]   where the reason for a busyness.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.040]   Corrie Ten Boom was a Holocaust survivor Christian.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.640]   She said, "If the devil cannot make us bad,
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.420]   "he will make us busy."
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.840]   The reason number four that we bring on stress
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.980]   is we just are doing too much.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.300]   That phone went off.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.840]   You are ousted, bro.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.640]   You are ousted.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.840]   You are just, no, I'm kidding.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.040]   All right.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.500]   That it'll make us busy.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.640]   There's a acronym or a cross stick
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.800]   that was busy is standing for being under Satan's yoke.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.360]   That if he can make you busy,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.520]   he'll take your eyes off of where life is found.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.960]   He'll get you going through constantly,
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.720]   just going through the motions and the treadmill of life,
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.160]   never actually going anywhere that matters.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.020]   But you'll be busy.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:48.920]   So those are some of the sources that bring stress in.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.080]   And then there's some of the side effects
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.840]   that we see paralleled in Martha's story
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.080]   that are in our own where in verse 40, it says this.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.880]   She came to Jesus and she asked him,
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.000]   remember, Jesus is sitting there in the living room.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.600]   Everybody's sitting around,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.200]   listening to the teaching of Jesus.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.800]   And Martha's in the kitchen,
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.880]   whipping up scrambling eggs or doing whatever she's doing.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.680]   And she interrupts Jesus and she says,
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   "Lord, don't you care that my sister
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.720]   "has left me to do all the work by myself?"
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.560]   I love it.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.680]   The manipulation and the like, just passive aggressiveness
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.440]   bleeds off the pages.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.160]   Is this because you're not a caring God, Jesus?
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.000]   Is that why this is?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.120]   "Lord, don't you care?
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.680]   "Tell her to come help me."
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.380]   "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.040]   "You are worried and upset about many things,
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.880]   "the side effects of stress."
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.960]   Martha is telling Jesus what to do.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.240]   It's not a good look.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.800]   And you contrast that to Mary,
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.080]   who is sitting at the feet of Jesus,
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.740]   listening what to do.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.980]   And Martha, because of all the stress that's taking place,
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.880]   she does what often happens when you're stressed,
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.160]   you reach for control.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.840]   You reach to try to control situations,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.960]   relationships, circumstances, what people think.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.000]   And she reaches, and the direction she reaches
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.080]   is an attempt to control her sister
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.720]   and control God himself.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.280]   She's blaming, another side effect,
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.120]   it's not just control,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.640]   she's blaming other people for her problems.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.900]   "Hey, my sister is why I'm so stressed.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.440]   "Why don't you tell her to come in here and come help me?"
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.600]   She's, in essence, even blaming Jesus.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.120]   "Don't you care?"
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.240]   And Martha is telling him what to do.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.360]   This same thing happens today.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.080]   When we're distracted, we get self-centered,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.680]   stressed because God is not doing the things
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.600]   that we expect God to do.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.760]   And we bargain with him, "God, I told you
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.820]   "that if I went to church,
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.840]   "then you were gonna bring someone
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.080]   "and a healthy relationship along.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.100]   "God, if I'm honest in these finances,
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.680]   "then you were supposed to let this start up work."
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.240]   And we allow stress to lead us to attempt to control.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.660]   She asked the question, "Lord, don't you care?
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.540]   "'Cause if you did,
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.620]   "then you would tell Martha to get in here."
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.120]   Baked into that assumption is a pretty profound truth,
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.860]   a pretty profound presupposition she's starting with.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:27.020]   "If you cared, you would behave
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.440]   "how I expect you to behave.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:35.400]   "And so because, God, you are not behaving,
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.700]   "or the situation is now not how I expect it to be,
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.960]   "you must not care about me."
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.560]   She's doing something that human experience includes.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.320]   "God, because I'm looking at my situation
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.520]   "and how things are going and what's going on in life,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.380]   "and I don't like the way it looks,
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.240]   "I can conclude you must not care about me.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.960]   "Now, if I'm Jesus and I'm sitting there
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.800]   "and I'm trying to teach,
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.500]   "and who knows what he's walking them through,
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.240]   "some of the parables or whatever he's teaching
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.080]   "in the living room, and he's getting interrupted
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.180]   "by a woman in an apron who's saying,
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.680]   "'Why don't you care about me?'
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.460]   "You gotta be thinking he's going, 'Martha,
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.720]   "'of course I care.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.900]   "In 11 days, I'm gonna be crucified on a cross for you.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.300]   "Of course I care.
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.920]   "And just because you can't connect the dots
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.900]   "on how I could care in this situation
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.080]   "doesn't mean that I don't care.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.080]   "I'll prove on the cross how much I care for Martha
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.640]   "and how much he cares for you,
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.960]   "how much he cares for me,
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.440]   "that I will even die on the cross for you."
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.940]   Now, this brings up a really challenging thing in life
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.300]   that you've gotta have some awareness of
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.700]   if you read the Bible and you hear pastors like myself say,
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.980]   "Hey, God cares about you.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.040]   "We just sang a song.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.920]   "If he clothes the lilies and if he watches the sparrow,
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.300]   "how much more will he care for you?"
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.360]   And that's the truth.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.500]   But your definition of care is really important in that.
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.640]   Because it may not always be that God acts
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.380]   in a way that you think God should act
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.220]   because he cares about you.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.040]   What do I mean?
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.060]   I have a three-year-old daughter.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.660]   She, her name's Monroe.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.580]   She's a firecracker.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.420]   Pray for us.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.100]   And she will, if we let her,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.500]   she would eat Pringles for every meal.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.180]   I mean breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.500]   And if it wasn't that, then it would be Cheetos
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.500]   or some other incredibly unhealthy food.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.580]   Now, because we love her and care for her,
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.140]   there are times where as good parents,
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.040]   we don't allow her to just eat Cheetos
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.160]   or don't just allow her to eat junk food.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.340]   Why?
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.320]   Because we don't care?
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.160]   No, because we care for her.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.560]   And she thinks, "You guys hate me.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.040]   "You don't listen to me.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.400]   "First, you wouldn't let me wear the dress I wanted to wear
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.760]   "and now the Pringles."
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.760]   And she will think, "My parents don't care."
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.720]   But because she's three, she can't connect the dots.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.360]   She can't fully understand it.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.900]   I think the same experience happens with us in God.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.380]   Where though we're older than three,
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.740]   just at 24, you think that you will fully,
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:22.340]   it will always comprehend the wisdom of an infinite God
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.560]   who is a far greater distance between my age
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.020]   and my daughter's age than my age in God and who he is.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.960]   And there are times where God absolutely would say,
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.120]   "Yes, I care.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.840]   "Do not draw the conclusion that I don't
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.180]   "just based on things not being how you want."
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.700]   And Martha's confronted with this.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.760]   There's another occasion where Martha experienced
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.440]   this reality and it was one that is probably
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.040]   one of the more powerful stories in the Bible
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.560]   and certainly the most powerful moments in Martha's life.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.440]   Like I said, Martha had a sister named Mary
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.480]   and Martha also had a brother named Lazarus.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.520]   And this group was really close with Jesus.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.080]   I mean, multiple times throughout the gospels,
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.200]   they talk about Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.940]   They were just like boys with Jesus and the disciples
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.080]   and they're all friends together.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:13.080]   And one day Jesus is told that Lazarus has gotten sick,
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.200]   like really sick.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.120]   And it's in John chapter 11, it tells us this.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.360]   "A man named Lazarus was sick.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.640]   "He was from Bethany, the village of Mary
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.900]   "and her sister Martha.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.060]   "So the sisters sent word to Jesus,
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.460]   "Lord, the one you love is sick."
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.400]   So Lazarus is sick, they send word to Jesus.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.640]   They say, "Hey, our brother is sick,
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.440]   "expecting he's gonna come home
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.760]   "and he's gonna heal our brother."
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.680]   This is what Jesus was doing at the time.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.600]   And we're told in the text,
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.640]   I don't have time to read the whole thing,
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.120]   but Jesus says he's sick
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.040]   and he waits an additional two days.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.200]   And during that time, Lazarus dies.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.120]   And Jesus then tells his disciples,
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.160]   it's as though he was waiting for the sickness to happen
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.720]   or he wasn't in a rush to go change
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.640]   or stop the brother from dying.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.680]   And he tells his disciples,
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.520]   "We're gonna go see Lazarus."
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.200]   And Jesus walks back towards the village
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.720]   where Mary and Martha and Lazarus has now been buried.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.080]   His funeral has happened.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.180]   And Martha's told by somebody,
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.440]   "Hey, Jesus is about to be here.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.040]   "He's coming to the village to come see you."
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.120]   And she runs outside, she falls at the feet of Jesus.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.420]   She says this, "Lord," Martha said,
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:25.060]   "if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.020]   "But I know that even now,
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.220]   "God will give you whatever you ask."
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.720]   Jesus takes her to the tomb.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.400]   He's basically in that exchange, says,
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.840]   "Your brother will rise again."
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.560]   She says, "Man, I know someday he will rise."
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.640]   And he says, "He will rise today.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.920]   "I am the resurrection.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.380]   "I am the life."
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.600]   Later in the story, we're told that Jesus waited
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.940]   in order for all of the funeral and everything to happen
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.040]   for him to pass away so that the power of God
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.060]   would be displayed.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.440]   Her assumption was that if you were here,
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.280]   he wouldn't have died.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.980]   And Jesus basically responds with,
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:06.240]   "I waited so that you and all those who look
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.520]   "would see the power of God."
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.800]   But here's what happens that displays not just
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.420]   his control, his sovereignty is the word,
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.520]   but his care.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.620]   He walks up to the tomb of Lazarus,
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.680]   and he's about to say, "Roll the stone away
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.500]   "and bring this man back to life."
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.740]   And before he does, there's this crowd around the tomb.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.580]   And we're told Jesus just starts to weep.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.860]   And he's weeping.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.300]   I mean, not like a crocodile tear.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.360]   The word in Greek is that he's bawling.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.100]   Why?
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:46.220]   He's about to raise the man from the dead.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.500]   Why are you crying?
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.200]   I mean, think about that.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.540]   And he puts on full display the compassion of our God
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.100]   who looks death in the eyes and says,
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.940]   "It was never supposed to be like this."
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.740]   Does he care?
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.840]   Of course I care.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.380]   I displayed it on a cross,
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.240]   and I care more deeply about you than you care about you.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.060]   And he says, "Lazarus, come out of the tomb,
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.120]   "and this man comes back to life."
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.480]   And Martha again sees the care of her God,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.180]   despite the fact that it contradicted
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.820]   what she thinks if he cared, he would have done.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.340]   But stress can make us assume and control
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.120]   and self-centered and project.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.620]   It's the side effects of stress.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:41.020]   And finally, we see the positive example from Mary,
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.240]   but we also see something that I think is one of the single
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.260]   most profound sentences Jesus would ever speak.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:51.260]   Gosh, this is like my favorite part of this week.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.700]   Here's what he says.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.940]   Let me read the verse before and the verse after.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.020]   Remember the context.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.420]   It's like 12 dudes and these two women
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.240]   bickering about the meal.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.980]   She came and she said, "Lord, don't you care my sister's
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.860]   "left me to do all the work?
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.960]   "Tell her to help me."
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.660]   "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered,
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.480]   "you are worried and upset about many things,
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.300]   "but few things are needed."
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.160]   Scratch that, "Indeed, only one."
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.880]   "Mary has chosen what is better,
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.380]   "and it will not be taken away from her."
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.780]   What did Jesus just say?
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.860]   Jesus, in front of these two women and 12 guys,
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:43.860]   bottom lines the entire point of existence on planet Earth.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.040]   There is only one thing that matters
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.800]   at the end of the day, Martha,
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.920]   and it's what Mary is doing right now.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.520]   That the entire point of your existence on planet Earth.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.440]   That's why I say it's one of the more profound sentences.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.960]   He said, "You know what really matters in life?
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.640]   "Actually, only one thing really matters,
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.920]   "and it's what Mary's doing right now."
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.020]   What is Mary doing?
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.720]   Nothing.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.620]   She's sitting at the feet of Jesus.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.040]   She's sitting in relationship with him.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.600]   And he says, "You know what the point of life is?
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.840]   "You're concerned and consumed, and you're stressed,
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.640]   "and you're worried, and you're focused on all these things,
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.820]   "and you know that none of those things matter.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.040]   "Let me tell you the one thing that matters in life,
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.660]   "the one reason you're on the planet, Martha,
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.660]   "the reason why every person who's ever been created
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.800]   "and born and lives, the only reason
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:40.680]   "that you're here is to know me."
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.240]   It's a really profound thing.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.840]   If I'm Jesus, I would have saved that line
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.880]   for a huge crowd of people outside,
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.480]   but this bro just chooses in the living room
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.760]   from Martha, "Hey, the one reason you're on planet Earth
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.920]   "is what Mary's doing, listening to me."
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.360]   And the one reason he would say to you,
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.320]   with all the stress, and the fear, and the concern,
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.000]   and the weight, "Listen to me very closely.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.160]   "There is one reason you're here,
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.200]   "and all these different messages are gonna bombard you
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.820]   "every single day about what you need to get done,
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.920]   "what you haven't got done, what more you need to do.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.440]   "There is one thing that will actually bring you life,
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.940]   "and the one thing behind why you have life,
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.980]   "and that's to know Jesus, and to walk with Jesus."
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.640]   And he brilliantly says, "There's only one thing
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.440]   "that at the end of the day matters.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.620]   "It's not cooking, Martha.
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.780]   "It's not business.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.860]   "It's not marriage.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.660]   "It's me.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:38.520]   "And you and every other person knowing me."
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:44.920]   The solution to stress is sitting with the Savior,
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.840]   because by sitting, that just means
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.960]   sitting under the teaching of someone.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.100]   That's what that idea meant,
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.480]   that she's sitting there listening to the teaching.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:58.440]   She's sitting there learning from Jesus,
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:04.920]   and in doing so, she's experiencing her purpose,
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.440]   the reason God has her on this planet,
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.360]   which is also the solution to the stress
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.660]   that bombards us from all the different things
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:12.720]   that fight for our attention.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.560]   And Jesus would say, "There's only one thing
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.000]   "at the end of your life that makes it
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   "or breaks it as a success, and it's knowing me.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.060]   "Only one thing that ultimately matters."
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.480]   So the solution to our stress, what does this look like?
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.460]   Practically, for us, it's not gonna look like
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.520]   sitting in Martha's living room.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.440]   It's gonna look like spending time reading your Bible,
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.420]   and listening.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.120]   Tomorrow when you wake up, I want you to open your Bible
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.880]   and spend five minutes, maybe it's been five months,
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.200]   five years, maybe it's been never since you read it.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.560]   If you don't have a Bible, we have Bibles
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.720]   in the Welcome Center, it's a free gift for you.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.080]   If you're listening online, check out Amazon.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.080]   But if you don't have one, open it up.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.040]   Start in the book of John, or any of the Gospels,
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.440]   and just read a chapter, and say, "God, will you speak to me
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.160]   "and help me to see what happened?"
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.100]   Take notes, spend time in praying, and just say,
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.720]   "God, hold on."
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.080]   Maybe you read a text and you're reminded,
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.360]   "God is in control.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.160]   "So God, will you help me today just to meditate?
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.280]   "You're in control.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.840]   "You're in control over my job, my boss, my family,
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.360]   "my future, I'm just gonna hold on to that.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:38.160]   "Maybe it's that you are for me,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.040]   "that you talk in this chapter
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.480]   "about how much you love humanity, and you gave your life.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.520]   "I'm gonna remember that, 'cause I'm gonna be tempted
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.960]   "to think, oh no, God doesn't love me,
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.120]   "he doesn't care, he just helped me."
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   And you just meditate on that for a day.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.760]   But you were created to walk in relationship with God,
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.080]   created to experience your purpose.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.760]   And that one thing is gonna involve you spending time
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.360]   praying, reading, listening, journaling out,
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.040]   and telling God what you're feeling.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.080]   And you know what happens when that takes place?
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.280]   It's like the more you spend time with Jesus,
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.280]   you begin to get clarity on the things that he says matter,
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.040]   and even how to do those things that he says matter.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.720]   And that clarity begins to give you some sort of sense of,
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.300]   hey, these are the things I should spend my time on.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.240]   Not the only things I should spend my time on,
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.600]   but these are the focuses I need to at least make sure
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.800]   are a priority, because the more that I listen
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.080]   and walk with Jesus, the more I experience peace,
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.480]   and the more I experience life,
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.560]   called abundant life, he calls it.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.920]   And so I begin to be familiarized and know,
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.360]   this is how I'm gonna use my time.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.320]   Like pretend this represents your time.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.600]   You got 24 hours in a day, you can't change that.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.320]   I can't change that, everybody's got the same amount of time.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.640]   You, me, Beyonce, Thomas Edison, everybody.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.760]   But you can choose what you fill that time with.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.900]   And this would represent just all the extra stuff.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.640]   It's not bad stuff, it's your call of duty,
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.600]   which probably is not a great use of time,
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.040]   but it's the shopping at the mall,
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.480]   it's hanging out with friends, it's a happy hour at work,
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.640]   it's whatever it is, it's just resting
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.120]   and watching a football game.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.840]   And if you're not careful and intentional
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:20.600]   to put in the big rocks, the most important things in life,
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.200]   then your life becomes filled up
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.200]   and things that God commands to be a part,
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.760]   things that bring about the most peace,
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.480]   there's not room for.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.760]   But if you say, hey, I'm gonna be intentional,
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.000]   'cause God says, you know,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.280]   I'm not supposed to walk through life alone,
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.160]   I need other people, other Christians in my life,
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.280]   'cause life is hard, but it's a lot harder if I'm alone.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.640]   So you know what, big rock,
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.320]   I'm gonna make sure every week I meet with my guys group
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.440]   or my girls group, I'm gonna have people in my life,
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.440]   that's in there, man.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.400]   And so Thursday nights, if we meet on Thursdays,
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.500]   does that mean I miss Thursday night football if it happens?
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.080]   Yeah, or we watch the game together.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.920]   But that's a rock that I'm putting in there.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.800]   What's another one?
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.520]   Spending time daily with God.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.240]   I'm gonna spend time daily in God's word.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.080]   What does that mean?
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.560]   It means that if I'm gonna work out with a bro
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.860]   or with somebody in the morning,
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.240]   I'm gonna wake up even earlier to spend time in God's word.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.240]   Or after the workout,
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.480]   I'm gonna sit outside of my office building
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.880]   and I'm gonna open my Bible
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.120]   before I ever go inside of office, ever go to work,
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.400]   I'm gonna spend time, I'm gonna read.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.280]   That rock's going in, I'm putting it in.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.440]   I can't control everything,
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.780]   it's not the only things going in,
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.060]   but I'm gonna put that into my life.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.000]   I'm gonna prioritize being serving
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.320]   and connected to a local church,
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.200]   'cause God made you uniquely,
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.320]   you have gifts, you have a mind.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.400]   There is no one on the planet that is like you,
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.140]   and he wants you to use those gifts
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.280]   to be a gift to other people.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.880]   And you use the way he wired you,
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.200]   and so you decide, you know what?
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.480]   That's gonna be what I do.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.600]   I'm gonna come serve at the porch,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.760]   I'm gonna come serve in my city,
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.520]   I'm gonna go serve at the food banks downtown,
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.640]   and I'm gonna push back darkness.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.040]   Do you know how many kids need mentors
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.180]   in the education system inside of this city?
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.600]   The opportunities and the gifts and the resources you have.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.960]   And Jesus says, "To whom much is expected,"
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.040]   or to whom much is given, much is expected.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.280]   And you're gonna stand before God
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.320]   and you're gonna give him an account.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.320]   He's already used my 20s, he's already used my life,
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.800]   how are you using them?
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.640]   But some of you guys are saying,
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.320]   "No, that's a big rock, man, I'm putting that in.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.880]   "I'm gonna serve like Christ served me,
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.840]   "I'm gonna serve and be a source of light
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.900]   "in a really, really dark world.
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.160]   "Not only that, I'm gonna be plugged into a local church.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.100]   "I'm gonna be connected, I'm gonna walk authentic,
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.800]   "I'm gonna live in relationship with my family,
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.900]   "they're not even believers,
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.940]   "but I'm gonna prioritize praying for them,
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.160]   "pursuing them, spending time with them,
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.360]   "telling them about my life,
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.680]   "and I'm gonna put those rocks in."
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.200]   And then all of a sudden, anything that I got left extra,
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   it's not that I'm not still doing Call of Duty,
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.040]   if that's your thing, or going shopping
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.960]   at wherever you shop,
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.040]   but it's not taking over what's most important.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.900]   And God's not against any of those neutral things,
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.240]   He is pro for you experiencing the abundant life,
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.740]   and the more you spend time with Jesus,
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:39.920]   I sit at His feet, that's what it means,
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.720]   to be taught and learn, this is the things that matter.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.800]   And I can put into practice the things that matter.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.200]   And that allows me the margin to still have fun,
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.160]   still relax, and still travel with friends,
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.540]   do all of that, but not at the expense
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.320]   of filling up my life,
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.580]   and not putting in the big rocks first.
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:06.680]   And Jesus says there's one thing in life that matters,
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:11.460]   and you're either gonna spend your life missing it,
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.580]   or spend your life experiencing it,
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:19.200]   and that's knowing me, and walking in relationship with me.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.160]   Francis Chan said, who's an author, friend,
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.240]   I've been here before,
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.780]   our greatest fear should not be of failure,
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.940]   but of succeeding at things that really don't matter in life.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:37.260]   Am I saying that if you work 90 hours a week,
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.480]   and you can't be a part of a church,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.420]   you should change jobs, yes.
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.080]   Am I saying you may need to get off dating apps,
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.180]   because they're constantly making or breaking your day, yes.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.020]   Maybe.
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:52.100]   Am I saying that you should not go to that happy hour,
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.160]   birthday party this week,
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.740]   because you have such a packed week, maybe.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.440]   Am I saying you may never be caught up
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.420]   with the latest Netflix trend that's going on,
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.420]   that everybody's already watched,
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.100]   and you're like, oh, another thing to do.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.680]   Yes, you may never.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.180]   But all those things are just additions,
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.520]   and they're never meant to place a role,
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.080]   of the big rocks, and the thing,
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.660]   the one thing Jesus said you were made for.
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.420]   As crazy as Martha,
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.940]   the FOMO you gotta think she had after,
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:27.600]   I can only imagine, 'cause here's what happened.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   Martha has the Son of God in her living room.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.720]   I'm about to land the plane right here.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.860]   Son of God sitting in her living room.
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.260]   What more important person could come over for dinner,
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.420]   or come into your house,
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.620]   and you spend the entire time in the other room?
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.440]   I mean, think about it.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.420]   This is like if Martin Luther King Jr.,
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.720]   you had a chance to have dinner with him,
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.640]   or Justin Bieber, or Selena,
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.940]   or whoever's your person that you're like,
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.000]   man, if I could only just have them,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   and hang out with them, and they show up to your house,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.800]   and you're in the kitchen, just baking cookies or something,
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.340]   while they're in the other room.
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.680]   It's ridiculous.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.940]   And yet she missed out.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.040]   And I think that same reality of her missing out,
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.360]   on spending time with the Son of God,
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.840]   is gonna be a reality that many people
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.860]   look back at their 20s, and they look back at their 30s,
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.460]   and they look back at a lot of their life,
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.460]   and they go,
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.660]   I was missing out.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.620]   What was I doing?
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.840]   I could have been knowing, and deepening,
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.420]   and walking with Jesus, and I chose not to.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:26.240]   So here's what I wanna do.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.680]   I wanna give us a chance for 60 seconds.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.780]   We're gonna put a verse up on the screen,
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.840]   and I just want you to look at it.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.780]   And I want you to pray.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.220]   Right where you are.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.100]   Don't turn your phone back on.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.220]   It's gonna be right on the screens,
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.840]   and I just want you to do this.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.100]   God, help me know where I'm distracted.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.360]   Help me with my anxious feelings.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.720]   You say, in the verse we're gonna look at,
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.220]   that your burden is light.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.620]   Help me to believe that, and experience that,
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.040]   and walk in that.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.860]   Because you have promised to give me the life of Jesus,
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:06.040]   and I wanna adopt what living like Jesus looks like.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.560]   Savior of the world, who was the only person
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.640]   without a Savior complex.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.040]   And so as that happens,
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.060]   the band will come up in a second,
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.500]   and I just want you to read these verses.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.000]   I just wanna give you a moment
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.480]   to breathe, and pray,
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:28.160]   and ask God to deepen and replace the panic
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.100]   at any level in your heart with His peace.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.560]   And then I'm gonna pray for us.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.400]   Come back.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:39.780]   (gentle music)
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.360]   (gentle music)
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.940]   (gentle music)
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.520]   (gentle music)
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.100]   (gentle music)
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.680]   (gentle music)
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:47:01.180]   (gentle music)
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:08.240]   (gentle music)
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:15.280]   (gentle music)
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.040]   (gentle music)
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:44.320]   Father, we live in a world that is constantly bombarding,
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.900]   and fighting for our attention.
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.480]   (gentle music)
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.240]   I know there are friends in the room
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.600]   who are walking through and facing incredible stress,
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.080]   overwhelmed by circumstances,
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.160]   sometimes related to things
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.840]   totally outside of their control, weary.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.640]   And you promise that those who are weary
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.140]   can come to you and find rest.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:18.160]   And so I pray tonight that you would allow that to happen.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.000]   And those who are tired would be strengthened.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.320]   Those who are anxious would experience peace
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.900]   that they can't even explain in words.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:32.720]   And you would help us to run in line with rhythms
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.560]   that lead to life, not exhaustion.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:41.620]   Thank you that you walked on this planet
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.680]   and modeled what that looks like.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.080]   And you gave your life for us,
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.500]   and you allow us to model life after you.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.720]   And remember that at the end of the day,
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.380]   there is one thing that matters.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:59.700]   Would like Mary, we choose it.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.100]   In Christ's name, amen.
