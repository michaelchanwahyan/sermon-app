[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   [Music]
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Porch, how are we doing?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   We doing okay tonight?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Doing alright?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   It's great to see you.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Man, I'm so glad to be back.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   There feels like no better way to start a brand new year
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   than being right back in this room with this group of people.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   So thanks for being here.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   If this is your very first time, let me be, hopefully not the first,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   but one of the first to just welcome you.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   This is a really special thing that's happening,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   not because I'm standing up here or the band's up here
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   or we've got amazing leaders that are around the room,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   but because God is here.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I really believe that.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   God is, he's really given us as a team and as a ministry
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and as a group of friends a great vision for what he wants to do this year.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And yet the heart behind this entire ministry
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   is that this wouldn't just feel like something you show up and spectate in.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   It would feel like something we're all participating in.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   That's why we wanted to represent it with a big choir on the platform.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   We wanted to put people in front of you just like you.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   That way you know, man, this is something we're all on the same level
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   engaging with the same God about.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   So welcome. So glad that you're in the room.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You need to know this before we go any further.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   We're going to look at a different text in just a minute.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   But the passage of scripture that we're established on as a ministry
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   that's straight right to the core of who we are
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   is a scripture called, a scripture that's Psalm 27, 4.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And it says this, it says,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   "There's one thing that I ask that will I seek after
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple."
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   That's what we want this place to be.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   A place where, man, every one of us is seeking to get as close to God as possible.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   God, we want to dwell in your house.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Like, yes, there's so many things in life that could demand our attention.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And yet there's one thing worthy of our attention,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   and it's to be with you. It's to get close to you.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And so, God, that's what we want. We want to come near.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   We believe there's no one like you, that you're most beautiful of all,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   and you're worthy of knowing.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And so that's what we're going to do.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   The way that we do it is we like to read the scriptures together.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And we love that God is letting us do this with the people here in Dallas, Texas,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   but he's also letting us do this with the people all over the nation
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   because the porch doesn't just gather in this room,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   it gathers in rooms all over the country.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   So would y'all do a great job of helping me say hello
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   to our Porch Live locations right now?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   That'd be awesome. Porch Live, we love you.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I just want to say a special shout out to Porch Live, Fort Worth, Indy, Midland, Wheaton,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Springfield, Dayton, Greater Lafayette, Scottsdale, and Fresno.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We love what God is doing where you are.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And as much expectation as we have for this room,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   we have an equal amount where you are too.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Well, it is the beginning of a brand new year.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   How are you feeling about it?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   2025 is officially upon us. How do you feel?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You feel good? Yeah. Mixed reviews. I get it, man.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And yet what we know is at the beginning of a brand new year
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   is likely the start of a journey towards some new goal
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   that you may have set out for yourself.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Sure, maybe you don't subscribe to traditional resolutions.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   You might be an ins and outs list kind of person.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And yet the reality is wherever you fall with respect to your commitment in the new year,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   what we know is we all want to do something meaningful with ourselves in this calendar year.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   We want to achieve something or accomplish something or attain something significant.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   It's characteristic of us all.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Maybe it's losing 10 pounds.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Or maybe it's gaining 10 pounds and drinking as much creatine as it takes to get there.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Maybe it's landing that job that you have always dreamed of.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Or it's leaving the job that you currently dread.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   They've taken too much of my life.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It's time for me to get some of my life back.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Maybe it's finding new friends or reconnecting with old friends.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Maybe it's speaking out more.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Letting the world know, "I've got a voice."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Maybe it's thinking before you speak and letting the world know you actually can control your voice.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Maybe it's getting more sleep at night.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Or maybe it's just trying to get out of bed every morning.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I don't know what the case may be for you.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Why don't you tell me? What are your new year's resolutions?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You got something? Anything that's in for the new year?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Just shout it out.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Run a marathon.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   You're going to do that one on your own, my guy.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   What else you got? Give me something else.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Wait, wait, wait. Ironman? You just got one-upped.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   This friend says he's going to go further.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   He's also going to swim and bike.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   What else? Give me something more.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I heard basketball.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   What was it? Come on, man.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Dunk a basketball. Dunk a basketball.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Okay, man, let us know when it happens.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   What else?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   You know, if I could discern what you all want to do,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I would call these things out, but it's a massive humanity.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And what I know, though, is you're verifying the fact
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   that we've all got something we want to do in the new year.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   We've got big dreams, big hopes, goals that we want to achieve,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   destinations that we want to arrive at.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   That was the case for Brooke and I.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Whenever several years ago we decided to go and visit the Greek islands.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   While we were there, we spent several days on the island of Santorini.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Anybody been to Santorini before?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Show of hands, anybody want to go to Santorini?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   If you don't have a hand up, you should definitely put a hand up,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   because that place is amazing.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   While we were in Santorini, there was one thing we knew we wanted to see,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   because it was a must-see attraction.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   It was this volcanic hot spring.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Just the sound of it is awesome.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And yet, it came with one massive complication,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   because in order to get to the volcanic hot spring,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   you had to sail through the Aegean Sea, which sounds awesome.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Even just the thought of moving through a Greek sea sounds incredible,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   until you think about the fact that while beautiful,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   at the time of year which we were in Greece,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   we knew that there were these melteme winds,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   which are really unpredictable or unreasonable gale force winds
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   that would stir up over the sea and would throw the entire thing into a commotion.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   It was a disorienting journey, to say the least.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And yet, we knew we wanted to get to this volcanic hot spring.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   So how did we do it?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Did we do it because we really wanted it,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   and we were going to find a way to get there on our own?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   No. We needed to find someone that was skillful at decision-making,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   that was accustomed to the open waters, a true sea dog, if you will.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   We needed to find a captain who was trained at reading the waves
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and watching the wind and adjusting course accordingly,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   depending upon what happened in the journey.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Now, why do I tell you that?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Because the reality is, many of us, we enter into a new year
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   with hopes of a proverbial hot spring.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   We've got something that we really want to get to,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   and yet the difference between where we are and where we want to be
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   requires not just desire, not just discernment,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   but true dependence on someone that knows better than ourselves.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You see, the reality is, the hope you have today
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   and the future you want tomorrow
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   is separated by the difference of several decisions
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   that you must make along the way.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   But what you bring to the table is not your savvy decision-making.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   You bring a really intentional dependence
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   on one that knows the waters better than yourself.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   That's what I want to talk with you about tonight.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   We're sitting at the beginning of a brand new year,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   and yet there's a way to navigate the new in 2025,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   particularly three steps that I want to help you understand.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   So if you have a Bible, you can turn with me to the book of Numbers.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Chapter 13. Numbers 13.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Just to bring you up to speed,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   we're catching up to the people of God in a moment where
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   they're standing at the beginning of a brand new chapter themselves.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   They are staring down the barrel of their own new beginning.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   They're at the precipice of God's promise,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   the doorstep of the land they've longed for.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   But to get there, to go into the promised land,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   they have to make a really big decision.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   They have to navigate their own set of new.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And as we watch them do it, we'll learn some things for ourselves.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So this is what it says, Numbers 13, starting in verse 1.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   The Lord spoke to Moses saying,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   "Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which is the promised land."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   That's the land that they're going into.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   "Which I'm going to give to the people of Israel.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   every one a chief among them."
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Now, at first glance, this feels really wise, doesn't it?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Like send spies out, collect new intel, do some reconnaissance,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   build a scouting report.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Like it makes reasonable sense to do research before you make a big decision.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Yes?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Listen, if you're in the room, you're a young man,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   you want to ask out a young lady, you should probably do some recon.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Like you should probably figure out, man, like is she available?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Is she interested in actually dating somebody?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   If she were, where would she want to go?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   What would she want to do?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   What would be the best way to actually engage this individual?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Should I text her?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Nah, that's probably too impersonal.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Should I call her?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Ah, that could be awkward.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Maybe I'll just flirt with her through her Insta story.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Ah, that might be slightly misdirected.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Is DMing still a thing?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Should I send one?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Maybe I shouldn't.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   That might be ill-advised.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Talk to her?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   No way.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I would never, right?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   No, you need to do some recon.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Like you have to do some research to figure out, man,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   what's the best way for me to make a big move?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   So spying on the land seems like a really good idea.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   That is until you realize that it's not God's idea.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It's the people's, which can feel confusing because you read this in verse 1,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   it says, "The Lord spoke to Moses saying, 'Send men to spy out the land of Canaan.'"
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   It sounds like God's idea.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So how is it not his?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Well, if you go and you read Deuteronomy, what you find is Moses is actually speaking
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   to an entire new generation of Israelites, and he's recollecting this story.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   He's telling them what happened in times past,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   and this is what he says in Deuteronomy 1, verses 20-22.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   He says, "Then I said to you, 'We've reached the hill country of the Amorites,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   which the Lord our God is giving us.'"
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   See, the Lord your God has given you the land.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You hear the past tense?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   "Go up and take possession of it as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, told you.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Don't be afraid. Don't be discouraged.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Then all of you came to me and said, 'Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.'"
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   So was it God's idea or was it the people's?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   It was the people's. They cook up the idea.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   So then what's happening in verse 1? God is simply permitting the pursuit of it.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   That's what he's doing in verse 1. He is allowing them to do that which they want.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   You see, God isn't telling them, "Yeah, you really need to go spy out the land,"
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   because by this point, God has already spied out the land.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Like, he's not searching anything he has not already searched.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   If you go and you read, what you see is God has been promising this little piece of real estate
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   to God's people, their ancestors, for centuries.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Like, you see, he predicts literally everything they're going to find.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   What specific nations there were, Genesis 15, how rich the land would be,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   how he would defeat their enemies in Exodus 3, that this was their promised inheritance in Genesis 12.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   They had no reason to search out the land because God already searched it out for them.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   So why did they do it?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Because they trusted themselves more than they trusted God.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   They knew. There's a destination that we want to get to,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   but I don't know that the captain knows best.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Maybe we should grab the will and we should direct this thing ourselves.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   It's a massive misstep, and it's not one we should take if we want to navigate the new.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Instead, the first step we have to take as we move into a new year
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   and we consider the things that we believe God is leading us towards
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   is we have to know it is better to trust God's word than man's wisdom.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It's better to trust God's word than man's wisdom.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   They have every reason to believe God.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   They don't get to this point, to the foot of the promised land, without him.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And yet what they realize is despite everything he's done, they conclude he hasn't done enough.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Which feels crazy when you think about everything they've lived through.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   If you go and you read the moments that lead them to this situation here,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   two years after they've been journeying from Egypt to the foot of the promised land,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   what you see is God part of the Red Sea for them.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   He brought manna from heaven. He brought water from a rock.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   He was leading them by his own presence through a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   You hear all that and it's like, "They are crazy!"
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Why wouldn't they believe him?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Why wouldn't they trust him?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Why do they need to actually discern what's ahead for themselves?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Why would they do that?
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   What's funny is we do equally crazy things.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Often we choose to trust ourselves instead of trusting in God.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Because you see, where God made a way for them through the waters,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   he has made a way for you through your sin by Jesus Christ.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Where they forgot the fact that he provided manna from heaven,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   we often forget the fact that we've been given the bread of life through Christ himself.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Where he poured water from a rock, we have living water in Jesus.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   The presence of God, cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, that's amazing.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   We have the presence of God indwelling through his Holy Spirit.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   It's crazy that we wouldn't trust him ourselves.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   And yet we do this.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Like we stand on the cusp of that which God has been leading us to.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Moving to a new city and taking a new opportunity.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   The chance to change our career all together.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Or having gospel conversations with our neighbors.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Or going to therapy to unpack our past and pursue healing.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Or reconciling with a friend that we've lost touch with because of some hurt caused in the distant past.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Whatever it may be, we often stand on the cusp of what God's leading us into.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   But rather than respond in faith porch, we reason in fear.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   We reason in fear.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   We do what they do.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   We talk ourselves out of what God is talking us into.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Because we trust our discernment more than we trust his own.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Listen to what the psalmist says in Psalm 146.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   He says, "Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man in whom there is no salvation.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   When his breath departs, he returns to the earth, and on the very day his plans perish.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Blessed is he whose help is in the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God."
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   You trust in him, you don't trust in yourself.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Now, some of you hear me unpacking this point and you're like, "But Kylan, listen.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Are you telling me that I shouldn't be measured and prudent and wise with respect to my choices?
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Like, I'm supposed to just trust my gut, follow my heart, follow my instincts?"
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   No, I'm not telling you to just do that.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   And neither is God.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   And yet the reality is, often, we are not at risk of being hasty.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   We are in danger of being hesitant.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Like, we hear the call of God.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   We know what his word says, and yet we're slow to obey it.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   We feel conviction, but we're reluctant to take any action.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   We process and we pray and we second-guess, despite the fact that everybody in our community is looking at us and saying,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   "Yeah, you should do it. You should go for it."
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   We're reluctant.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   You see, what we do is we, instead of initiating in faith, we procrastinate in fear.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And the reality for why that is is because we don't just want clarity of God's plans.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   We want certainty of God's plans.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Some of you are so locked up.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   You won't move into what God is trying to do in your life because you're just not certain it's going to happen.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   In what world is faith and certainty possible?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Those things cannot coexist, for faith requires the presence of some uncertainty,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   because in the face of uncertainty, trust can exist.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   God wants you to trust him.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Now, he's not going to leave you out on a limb.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   He's going to give you clarity.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   He's going to bring conviction.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   He's going to call you to take a step.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   And yet, too often, we procrastinate in fear rather than initiate in faith.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Warren Weirsbe said, "Faith takes God at his word, and it needs no other evidence."
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   It trusts, man.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   God knows best, and what he says goes.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   So if he says, "I go," then here I am.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   I'm ready, God.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And yet, here's the thing.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   We struggle to do this.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   We wrestle with it.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   We know, oh, man, I really want to, but God, I don't know yet.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And yet, in his kindness, he knows we want for more reason, and so he often gives it to us.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   He does that right here in this passage.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   He does that for the Israelites.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   If we keep reading, we'll actually jump to 17.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It says, "Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and he said to them,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   'Go up into the Negev and go up into the hill country and see what the land is
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they're few or many,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Be of good courage.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Bring some of the fruit of the land.'
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Now the time was the season of the first grapes."
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I remember reading this, and it's striking me how strange it was
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   that Moses was giving such very specific instructions,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   and yet Moses is giving specific instructions because he knows what they'll find.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Like, he's not curious.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   I wonder if there's any fruit.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   He already knows because God has already told them.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And so he gives them very detailed instruction on what to look for.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   He tells them in verse 18, "Hey, go and investigate the people.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Are they strong? Are they weak? Are they few? Are there many?"
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   In verse 19, "Go and investigate the land."
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Like, is it a good land or is it a bad land?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   How about their cities? What are they like?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Are they big? Are they strong?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Verse 20, he tells them to investigate the soil.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Is it a rich soil or is it a poor soil?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   How about the trees? Are there trees there?
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Do you see fruit? Bring some of the fruit with you.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Like, Moses is oddly specific in what he wants them to search for
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   because he knows what they'll find.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   God's told him, and he wants them to know.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   If you find what God has already foretold,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   then you will have sufficient motivation to go.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Because as we seek to navigate the new,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   our second step is God will give you good reason to go if he calls.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   God will give you good reason to go if he calls.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And so they're going to seek.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   God's given us really good reason to take this land.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   And yet, Moses knows they have to find it to find sufficient motivation.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   So several years ago, Brooke and I, we were snow skiing
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   whenever she lost her iPhone somewhere out on the mountain.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Naturally, she really wanted me to find it.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Which wasn't incredibly motivating.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   You want me to find your phone on the side of a ski slope?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   It's crazy. It's a needle in a haystack.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   There's no way I'll do it.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And so the mission was not incredibly motivating for me.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   That is until I learned that her Find My Friends was miraculously working.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Now I had good reason to go.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   I actually was moving in a way where I wasn't just searching, but I was seeking.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I wasn't just aimless. I was directed.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   I knew where I could find it.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And it motivated me to get out of my chair and get back on the mountain.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And miraculously, we did in fact find the phone.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   You see, that's what's happening here.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   The spies, they want to survey the entirety of the land.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   But Moses, he doesn't want them to do it aimlessly
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   because that's not going to make any kind of difference for the people.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   No, Moses gives them very clear instructions.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   He doesn't want them to search.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   He wants them to seek several things in specific that will motivate the people when they're found.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   That's why he says, "Hey, go and see if there's fruitfulness."
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   He's literally sending them to a place called the Valley of Eshkol,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   which means the Valley of Grape Clusters.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And it's during the season of the first ripe grapes.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   What do you think they're going to find?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   They're probably going to find some grapes.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   And not just regular grapes, but grapes so big
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   that they actually have to be carried between two men on poles.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Like that's the kind of reality they're walking into.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   This is the ancient Near Eastern Napa, okay?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   That's where God's taking them.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   It is bursting with life.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It is full of flourishing.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And Moses knows, "Hey, this is a land that will motivate our people to go."
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   But you're also going to find some things that will motivate our people to not go alone,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   but to go with God.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   He tells them, "Hey, go look at the nations.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Assess their strengths. Inspect their cities.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   How strong are their fortresses?"
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   He knows, "Hey, the people are going to see this is a land that is bursting with abundance,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   and yet also it is a land that is begging for dependence."
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   There are plenty, plenty of reasons to go,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   but there are plenty of reasons to not go alone.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   That's how you know if God's leading you someplace new.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Some of you are here, and you're like, "Man, I'm torn between two decisions,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   and I don't know which one I'm supposed to take."
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I'm trying to discern whether God's leading me in or He's leading me out.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   How do I know? He gives you two reasons.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   He says, "Hey, look for signs of life," number one,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   "and then look for causes for trust," number two.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Like, it should be bursting with life, and it should be begging for dependence.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   That's how you know.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   It should be bursting with life.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Like, that's what Jesus says whenever He talked in John 10:10.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   He's like, "Hey, the reason I came is I came to give life.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Like, the thief came to steal, kill, and destroy,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   and yet I came that you may have life."
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And guess what? Have it abundantly, just like this.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   To the places that you consider, the things that you do,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   you should really evaluate, "Is this going to let me give life
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   to the rest of the world, to the people I engage with,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   and to the places that I occupy?"
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Because that's what the gospel does.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   The gospel gives life.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And so here's the thing.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   If you're thinking about a new job, and yet there's no opportunity
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   within that job to bring gospel flourishing,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   to lead people to life in Christ, then Jesus is not leading you there.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   He doesn't want you to take it, because He is going to lead you
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   to a place that is exploding with fruitfulness.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   That's what He wants to do.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   If you're thinking about dating someone, and what you realize
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   is in this relationship, I'm more prone to compromise in my sin
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   than conformity in Christ, He's not leading you there.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   He doesn't want you in it, because that's not what He's come to give.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   If you're thinking about friends, man, your friends,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   are they exclusive or inclusive?
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Because one is characteristic of Jesus, but the other is characteristic
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   of the world.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Do they gossip, or do they encourage people?
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Because one is what Christ would do.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   The other, Christ would have nothing to do with.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   What decision are you trying to make?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Does it have signs of life?
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   But then also, it should have causes for trust, which is what we see
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   as we continue to go.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Verses 25-28, it says,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   "At the end of 40 days, they returned from spying out the land,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   and they came to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation of the people
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   of Israel in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   They brought back word to them, and to all the congregation,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   and they showed them the fruit of the land.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   They found it.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   'Hey, man, here it is.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Look at this stuff.'
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And they told him, 'We came to the land with which you sent us,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   and it blows with milk and honey.'
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And this is its fruit, so big we had to carry it between two of us.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   But the people who dwell in the land are strong,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   and the cities are fortified and very large.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Like God has led them to a land bursting with life
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and brimming with potential and boasting with resistance."
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   It is boasting with resistance.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Why would God do that?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Because as God leads you into a new place, and you navigate the new,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   you should know God will not lead you someplace faith is not required.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   God will not lead you someplace faith is not required.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   The path of greatest--or the path of least resistance
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   is never the path of greatest faith.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   The path of least resistance is never the path of greatest faith.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And the reason for that is because the path of least resistance needs no God.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   We don't live lives where we do not need Him.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Such an existence is not possible.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   If we follow God, then we can expect we will go places beyond compare,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   and we will go places far beyond our depth.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Why? Because He wants you to trust Him.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   He wants you to need Him.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   He wants you to cling to Him, not just in the face of adversity.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Yes, He wants that.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   But He wants you to cling to Him, grip Him,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   hold fast to Him in the moments of opportunity as well.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Like these people, they knew, "God, we really need you in the wilderness.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   We've got some big problems out here."
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   And yet, God, the minute we've gotten to the promised land,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   I think we're good. I think we don't need you any longer.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   We can make decisions for ourselves.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   We can figure out the way on our own.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   God's having none of it.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Like, God is not just a God that we need in the face of our troubles
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   and our trials and our testing.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   No, God is a God we need at all times and in all ways.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Like, I think God is looking at them in this moment.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   He's like, "Hey, that is not how this relationship works.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Like, I will be there with you to work through your problems,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   but I will also be there to walk with you into my promises.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   You will never not need me.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   You will never not need me."
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   And that's actually good news,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   because I will never not be there.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   So many of us, we wrestle with inadequacy,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   but have you ever thought your inadequacy, "I'm not enough,"
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   is actually, it's just a declaration of dependency, but my God is.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Sure, I'm not enough to be eloquent in my workplace
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and lead my coworkers to Christ,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   but my God is enough, and I depend on him,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and so I know I can do it.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   I'm not bold enough to approach my neighbor
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   and really help them in the face of their situation
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   and share Christ's love with them,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   but even though I'm not bold enough,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Jesus in me is bold enough.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I can move in my dependency.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   I'm not strong enough to forgive that person.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Good thing Christ is with me.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   He is strong enough to forgive every person.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   That is the heart he has, not just to love his friends,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   but to love his enemies.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Any inadequacy you feel, it is a declaration of dependency.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Jesus, I never don't need you,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   and you are always here with me, God.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Praise the Lord that that is the case.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Friends, God will never take you someplace where he becomes optional.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   He will always take you places where he is required,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   because those are the only places that actually exist.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   He will take us where we are most dependent,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   for when we're in greatest need, he is closest by.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Like, God did this to me yesterday.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Yesterday.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Like, I was going a completely different direction with this talk.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I had been planning it for weeks.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   I had been doing deep study
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and building great illustrations
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   and assembling carefully worded points
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   and gathering parallel scriptures,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   all pointing to the person of Jesus.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I had been prepping this message that I felt God gave me
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   shortly after the porch ended in 2024.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   And yet last night, in the wee hours of the morning,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   it's like I hit a block.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   And I was talking to the Lord, and I was like,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   "God, I've been writing, but I can't write any longer.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   What is happening, God?"
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Like, we've been sitting on this.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Like, this is something we've been preparing for, Lord.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Why is it so frustrated now?
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Why are you complicating my life?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Why are you contesting my purposes, Lord?
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   And I think he was looking at me, and he's like,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   "Hey, I have something else I want you to do.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   I want you to walk with me and depend on me along the way.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   I want us to do something different,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   and I want you to be willing to move by faith."
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And so we started thinking about this passage.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And it feels so consistent with what God would do in my life,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   so consistent with what God will do in your life,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   because he will not lead us places
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   where faith is not required.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   I remember when I moved from Houston,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and I came to Dallas, I was driving here,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   car loaded with all of my belongings to finally settle.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   And I told the Lord, "God,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   if your presence will not go with me,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   do not take me up from here.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   And we made that agreement, birthed right out of Exodus 33.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   And as I've arrived, what I know is,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   even in moments where faith feels required,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   I know that agreement still stands,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   for God is always with me.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   His presence will not depart.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Now, why do I tell you that?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Firstly, because whenever I do preach that other sermon,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   it's gonna be great.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   And I can't wait for the day when it happens,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   so you should stick around.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   But secondly, and primarily the reason I share that with you,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   is because God, in his kindness, will lead you places
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   where your faith will be asked much of,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   but his presence will always deliver on.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Do you want that?
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Do you want that?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Like to live not just a year, but to live a life
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   where you experience the unexplainable,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   where you make way through the world
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   into things that happen.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   People can't really measure up who you are with what that is.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   There's a discrepancy.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   You're not great enough, you're not smart enough,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   you're not impressive enough, you're not talented enough.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Why then are these things happening?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Why is it that someone so simple as you
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   could find yourself dwelling in the face
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   of something as amazing as this?
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   How is it that you arrived to a place of promise?
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And you'll be able to look at them and say,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   it's nothing that I've done,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   but it's by everything that my Christ has done.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   That's what they have the opportunity to do,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   to move into a place that is so significant,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   and yet they're shackled in fear.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And yet as we read, we find one man who defies the rest.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Like he looks forward and he's not shackled in his fear.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Instead, he is released by his faith.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   It says in Numbers 13 30, but Caleb, he quieted the people.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Everyone's freaking out.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And he's like, calm down.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Everybody's silent.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Let us go up at once and occupy it.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   For we are well able to overcome it.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Caleb knows this is impossible apart from God.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   So thank goodness our God is with us.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   No foe is too great.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   No fear is too strong.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   No force is too mighty.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   If God goes with us, how do we know that?
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   We can be confident that God will go with us in times ahead.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Because God came towards us in times past.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   We can look back and we can see the fact
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   that Christ has stepped into our reality
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   and he has made all the difference.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Like Jesus, he trusted the words of God
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   more than the wisdom of man.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Like he knew there's a call on my life
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   and he did not hesitate from fulfilling it.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   He was obedient.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   He wasn't reluctant.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   He was released.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   He made moves because he knew if God's saying it,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   then I'm going for it.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And we also know that Jesus,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   he knew God had given him a good reason to go.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Like he looked at you and he looked at me
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   and he was like, man, they are enslaved in darkness.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   They can do nothing for themselves.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I need to get there.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   They need my help.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I will go quickly and I will come to them
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   that they might be with you again, God.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And then Jesus, while going to Calvary,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   walked to a place where faith was most required of all
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   as he laid down his life for the sins of many.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Friends,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   it's better to follow Jesus into a dangerous future
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   than abandon Jesus for a safe existence.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   For Jesus abandoned a safe existence.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   (soft music)
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   So that you might not have a dangerous future.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   What is shackling you in fear tonight?
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   What is keeping you dependent upon yourself
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   as opposed to God?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   He wants to identify it.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And then he wants you to let it go.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Not just because it's a new year,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   but because you have a new life in Christ Jesus.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   God, we love you.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And we thank you that we had time now, God,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   just to work through your scripture.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   We're eager to sing back to you, God.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.500]   (soft music)
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:35:02.000]   God, we want to be a people
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   that live our lives where faith is most required.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.500]   (soft music)
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   We want to be a people that go God wherever it is you want.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   We know God so often,
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:25.500]   it's our fear that locks us up,
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.500]   that keeps us at bay,
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   that will not let us move forward.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.500]   And so God, what we're asking
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.500]   is that you would release us from that fear.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.500]   That you would set us free from a safe existence
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.500]   and lead us into a glorious inheritance.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.500]   The chance, God, to be with you,
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.500]   to live as Christ,
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   and to experience all God that you want to give.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.500]   This isn't a prosperity gospel.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.500]   No, God, this is your promise to us
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.500]   that every day forward with you
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.500]   is better than any day we've lived behind.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.500]   And yet, God, we know that days forward
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   are days where we must walk by faith and not by fear.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.500]   And so God, we pray that you would help us to do it.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   I pray, God, that you would help us right now
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   as we take action on it, please.
