[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.400]   >> Well, good evening.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.320]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.180]   Hey, it is so good to be here.
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.320]   My name is Timothy Atik and I am one of the teaching pastors here
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.340]   at Watermark Community Church.
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.420]   And I always love getting to be at the porch.
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.980]   David and his team do such an incredible job.
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.320]   So, just get to step in tonight is truly a joy.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.560]   If you don't have a church that you call home, I want to invite you to come
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.460]   and join us on a Sunday morning.
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.140]   We would love to have you join us.
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.440]   I want to start tonight just by sharing with you a very unwise
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.820]   and unfortunate decision that I made several years ago.
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:15.240]   I attempted to drive from Austin to Dallas without my wife, but with my two kids who were 2
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.180]   and a half and 5 months old at the time.
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.360]   Very unfortunate decision.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.880]   You think that that's an easy task.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.840]   It's really not.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.300]   It's one of those things that you do and then you're like,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.220]   "That was really unwise.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.160]   I need a mentor."
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.840]   And so, here's how things played out.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.860]   I left Austin.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.620]   I began to make my way up I-35 and for the first hour, I was crushing it as a dad,
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.020]   primarily because both boys were asleep.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.860]   But an hour into the trip, they both woke up and I decided that it was time for lunch.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.820]   So, I pulled off into the parking lot of the Chick-fil-A in Temple, Texas.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.960]   If you've been to that Chick-fil-A, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.380]   And so, we pulled in and I parked and I just stopped and I thought about everything that needed
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.620]   to happen in order for me to get in and out with my two boys without dying.
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.480]   And so, I felt like I had my game plan.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.580]   I got out of the car and I began to make my way in and I just looked like a circus.
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.260]   I mean, I had diaper bags slung over my chest.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.840]   I had my 5-month-old in his car seat in this hand.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.520]   I had my 2 and a half-year-old Noah in this hand.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.700]   And you could like see the sympathy on the faces of the Chick-fil-A workers.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.880]   They were like, "My pleasure."
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.640]   Like, I know it's always their pleasure that night or that day.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.820]   It was truly their pleasure.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.760]   And so, I walked in, we got our food, we sat down, we began to enjoy our meal.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.340]   Everything was going incredible until right there in the middle of that meal,
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.120]   my 5-month-old did something devastating in his diaper.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.160]   I mean, just dropped a massive bomb.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.600]   It was the type of thing that it was like, "Okay, am I going to sit here and finish my
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.880]   number one with no pickles and a sweet tea with Chick-fil-A sauce or am I going to be a good dad
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.840]   and I'm actually going to go clean him up before I continue to enjoy my food?"
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.440]   And so, I just made the right decision that we need to clean this guy up.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   And so, I got to gather up all of our stuff.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.420]   I got both kids and we went into the bathroom of the Chick-fil-A in Temple, Texas.
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.760]   I pulled down the changing table, I put Andrew, my 5-month-old, on it and I told my 2-year-old,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.360]   "Hey, you just stand right here."
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.800]   And it was like every man's bladder was synced up that day because they all converged on the
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   bathroom at the same time.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.360]   So, we're in this tight space and I'm just ferociously wiping this kid down.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.960]   And right there in the middle of trying to clean him up, he floods the changing table,
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.400]   a different number this time, and he floods it to the point where the changing table is
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.320]   completely out of order.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.680]   And right as he floods the changing table, I use my last wet wipe.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.960]   So, here I am, people, I am stranded in a moment with a changing table that is out of order
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:13.240]   and I am holding a bare-bottomed 5-month-old up in the air with nowhere to put him and nothing to
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.120]   clean him out with.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.960]   And you might hear that and say, "Sounds like the worst-case scenario."
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.200]   It isn't.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.920]   The worst-case scenario is looking left just in time to see your 2-and-a-half-year-old playing
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.000]   with the urinal cake.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That's the worst-case scenario.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.480]   So, let's talk about stress.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:42.880]   Yes, it does.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.200]   That's all you need to know.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.400]   Let's pray and get out of here.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.880]   No.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.640]   I don't know if you've ever been stranded in a Chick-fil-A bathroom like that.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   Maybe you haven't.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.440]   But I'll tell you what I felt in that moment holding that bare-bottomed baby.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.240]   I felt stressed out, overwhelmed, and out of control.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.120]   And here's the deal.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.440]   If you have more to do than time to do it, if finances feel tight, if you are single and you
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.040]   don't want to be, if you feel lonely heading into each weekend, if you've got some major
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.080]   project coming up at work, I wouldn't be surprised if you feel the same exact way.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.520]   Stressed out, overwhelmed, and out of control.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.200]   Just show of hands right now.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.800]   Who can identify with that?
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.160]   Just be honest.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.320]   Any...yeah.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.480]   The majority of the people in the room in some way feel stressed out, overwhelmed,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.800]   and out of control.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.560]   And so tonight, I just want to encourage you, don't suppress your stress, address your
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.640]   stress.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.760]   And you might be like, "I ain't suppressing my stress.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.080]   Like, I am constantly stressed."
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.000]   Do you know what it looks like to suppress your stress?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.800]   It's to let stress move into your life and just make itself at home to where the life you know is a
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.320]   life where there's always stress.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.280]   Like, when I was in sixth grade, this freak accident happened and it necessitated me wearing
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.640]   an eye patch for a week because I got hit in the eye.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.840]   But out of that experience, I developed what's known as an eye floater, which means at any
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:30.240]   given time, I still have it to today, at any given time, I see black dots right here.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.800]   And for the first year I had it, I just thought a mosquito was constantly following me around.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.400]   So I was like, and I could never get it.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.120]   It was crazy.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.080]   But then that one black dot got some friends.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.560]   And so now I see a few black dots.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.040]   The world that I know is a world with black dots.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.280]   As far as I'm concerned, there are black dots in all of your worlds.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.120]   That's just the world that I know.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.280]   To suppress your stress is just to believe the world that you know, the life that you know,
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.640]   this is just the way it is, it's just stressful.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.640]   That's what it means to suppress your stress.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:14.320]   It's to believe that that is just the normal and natural reality of life.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.160]   But as we open up the scriptures, which I believe is the word of God, here's what we're
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.900]   going to see tonight.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.320]   Stress isn't inevitable, it's actually optional.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.080]   Why?
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.600]   Because Jesus Christ is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.080]   And so what I want to do is I want to look at a story in the Bible that might be familiar
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.320]   for some and for others.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.520]   It might be the first time that you've ever heard it.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.040]   But as we look at the story, what I want to do is I want to give you four key truths that
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.200]   you need to know if you want to address the stress in your life.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.280]   And what you do with these four key truths will determine whether your life is chaotic
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.280]   or calm.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.240]   It will determine if you go through this week feeling pressure or peace.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.320]   So if you have a Bible, turn with me tonight to Mark chapter four.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.360]   Mark chapter four is where we're going to be.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.640]   And as you're turning there, I just want to acknowledge the fact that there are thousands
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.440]   of people in this room, which is amazing.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.600]   And yet there are thousands of people all over this nation watching right now.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.440]   So as you're turning there, hello, Porch Live Midland, Texas, in Indy, in Scottsdale, in
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.600]   Austin, in Boise, I just love the fact that there are people all over this nation right
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.840]   now who are going to address their stress.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.880]   Okay?
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.040]   Mark chapter four is where we're going to be.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.120]   Okay, let me read you verses 35 through 38.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.040]   It'll just kind of set the scene for us.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:53.200]   It says this, "On that day when evening had come, he," that's Jesus, "said to them, 'Let
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.000]   us go across to the other side.'
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.560]   And other boats were with him.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:09.880]   And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.880]   was already filling.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.460]   But he," that's Jesus, "was in the stern, asleep on the cushion.
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:25.500]   And they woke him and said to him, 'Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?'"
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.200]   So all eyes on me, don't miss this.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.800]   Okay, this is a story that is taking place on the Sea of Galilee, real place.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.880]   Okay, the Sea of Galilee is situated at about 700 feet below sea level.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:45.080]   It's surrounded by hills, and it is said that with the right mixture of temperature, pressure,
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.720]   wind, that sudden and violent storms can arise on the Sea of Galilee.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:56.320]   This is a story about Jesus inviting his closest friends to get in a boat and to go to the
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.000]   other side of the Sea of Galilee.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.640]   And it's interesting what happens because as Jesus and his friends make their way across
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.920]   the sea, they find themselves in a massive storm.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:19.680]   And as water fills the boat, stress begins to fill their souls.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.980]   And the reason that I find that interesting is because, I don't know if you know anything
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:31.120]   about Jesus' closest friends, but before several of his friends began to follow him, what was
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.440]   their occupation?
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   Anyone know?
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   Fishermen.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.200]   So many of them were fishermen.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   Do you know what that means?
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.320]   It means that the Sea of Galilee had been their office.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.840]   These were boat guys.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.280]   They were lake guys.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.160]   Surely they had been in storms on the Sea of Galilee before.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.160]   And yet what do we see?
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:57.560]   We see professional fishermen running to Jesus saying, "Do you not care that we are perishing?"
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:04.240]   These professional fishermen find themselves in, "I think we are going to die," type of
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240]   storm.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.680]   And as water fills the boat, stress fills their souls.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.880]   Why?
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.760]   Because they begin to feel out of control.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.880]   We don't see any of these professional fishermen saying, "Been here, done this.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.320]   We know what these storms are like.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.800]   We just need to do that.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   Do this.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   You sit here.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   I'll do this."
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   No.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.040]   We see all of them saying, "I think that this is it.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.480]   This is how the story of my life ends."
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.820]   And it shows us something very important.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.840]   At the root of your stress, don't miss it.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.820]   Here's the first key truth that you need to know if you want to address your stress.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.920]   At the root of your stress is a lack of control.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.920]   Do you realize that?
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.720]   Like if you were to just excavate down to the root of what is stressing you out, this
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   is it.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.040]   At the root of your stress is a lack of control.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.480]   Like if you have more to do than time to do it, the reason that you're stressed is because
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.700]   you can't control the clock.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.760]   You can't manufacture a 30-hour workday.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.640]   If you're stressed out by the thought of being a bachelor to the rapture, some of you are
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.800]   like, "Sounds incredible."
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.000]   Others of you are like, "God, please no."
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.760]   But if the idea of being single for forever stresses you out, it's because you can't control
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.760]   when you're going to find somebody that it just makes sense to do life with for the rest
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.440]   of your life.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.480]   If you're lonely and you just feel that stress of like, "What am I going to do this weekend?
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.040]   Is it going to be another weekend of me sitting here by myself?"
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:46.840]   If finances are tight, inflation is real right now, and yet maybe your salary isn't changing
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.520]   with it, and that is stressful.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.760]   You're looking at your debt, you're looking at living in Dallas, and you're like, "Those
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.560]   two things don't work well together."
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.560]   It's stressing you out.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   Why?
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.720]   Because you feel out of control.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.840]   You can't change how much money is coming in at the frequency it's coming in.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.120]   At the root of your stress is a lack of control.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.620]   So just do a deep dive into your own life.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.880]   What is at the root of your stress?
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.520]   What is the thing that you cannot control?
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.160]   You're going to love the second key truth.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.860]   Here it is.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.920]   God will intentionally lead you into situations that you cannot control.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.120]   No one's saying amen to that.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.320]   But that's a reality.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.440]   Like God will intentionally lead you into situations that you cannot control.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.280]   Whose idea was it to go across to the other side of the Sea of Galilee?
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.080]   It was Jesus' idea.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.840]   We know that Jesus is God, which means he knows all things.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:54.480]   He knew that an "I think we are going to die" type of storm was going to come, and yet he
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:01.280]   suggested that they go across the sea at the exact time that there would be a storm.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.480]   And then if you were to take this book and you were to just read the stories, you know
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.480]   what you would just see?
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.880]   You would see story after story of God putting his people in situations that they cannot
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.880]   control.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.960]   Like Moses busts two million plus people out of slavery to Egypt and begins to take
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.560]   them on the largest road trip in history.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.160]   And yet where did they find themselves?
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160]   At a dead end.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   At a dead end with the Egyptian army in pursuit.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.280]   Daniel was thrown into a den of lions.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.880]   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were thrown into a fiery furnace.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:43.200]   Zechariah and Elizabeth were old, wrinkly, and barren.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.760]   It's just story after story of God putting his people into situations that they cannot
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.760]   control.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.240]   And I think it just begs the question, if God truly loved us, why would he do that?
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.400]   And I promise you I'll answer that question before I'm done.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:04.040]   But the reason that we struggle with the fact that God will lead us into situations that
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:11.560]   we cannot control is because the majority of us are control freaks.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.560]   We're control freaks.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.560]   Like some of you are budding control freaks and some of you are in full bloom and you
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.680]   know who you are.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.720]   We need to have every aspect of our lives under control.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.900]   We need to have our bank account under control.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.200]   We need to have our job title under control.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.680]   We need to have our future plans under control.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.480]   We need to have our relationship status under control.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.260]   We need to have the number on the scale under control.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.840]   We need to have the reflection in the mirror under control.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:50.180]   We need to have our weekend plans under, we need every single aspect of our lives under
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.260]   control.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.880]   And if that's you, if you need to be in control of every aspect of your life, let me just
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.140]   lovingly tell you what your life will perpetually feel like.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:05.080]   It will constantly feel like trying to carry a big pile of laundry.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   What do I mean by that?
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:13.920]   Well, for the people in here who do their own laundry, hopefully that's everyone.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.920]   What do you do?
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.240]   Okay, you stuff the washing machine with everything that you can get into it, sometimes too much
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.680]   stuff but then you take that stuff and you put it in the dryer and after the dryer's
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.080]   run its cycle, what do you do?
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.480]   You open the door.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.620]   And you think to yourself, like, I'm going to get this all in one load.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.120]   Like we're busy people.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.840]   We don't have time to make multiple trips from the dryer to the couch or from the dryer
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.840]   to our bedroom.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   And so what do we do?
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.420]   We get in there and we scrape the inside of the dryer and it's a feeling deal.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.740]   You just got to wait till you feel it.
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:55.940]   And when you just sense that you have every article of clothing in your grasp, that's
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.040]   when you begin to make the walk, the walk to the couch or to the bed.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:08.100]   But as you're walking, you get this deep sense inside of you to look back.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.340]   And what do you see?
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.420]   Man down.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.820]   Sock down.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:21.340]   Now, this is where we display our brilliance, people.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:27.340]   Because instead of going and dropping off the pile and coming back, no, we developed
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:32.100]   this very noble and heroic mantra of no sock left behind.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:40.540]   And so we back up with the entire pile and we try and balance the entire pile of laundry
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.740]   in one hand as if two hands was working out for us.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.660]   We free up an entire hand to grab the sock.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.940]   And when we have the sock in our grasp, just when we think we have it all together, what
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.660]   do you see?
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.860]   Whitey tighties down and shame on you for never switching to boxers, but this will be,
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.700]   this will just be your life.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.300]   You will want control and you just won't have it.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.020]   Like just when you think life is good, you know what?
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.020]   Financial sock down.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.100]   And just when finances begin to come together, you know what?
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.900]   Relationship stock underwear, or those are two different things.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:25.300]   Relationship underwear down.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.780]   This is just your reality.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:33.740]   God will intentionally lead you into situations that you cannot control.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:40.000]   It leads me to the third key truth that you need to know if you want to address your stress.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.180]   You don't have to be in control because Jesus already is.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.180]   That's it.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:51.020]   You don't have to be in control because Jesus Christ already is.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.020]   Look back at the text.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.540]   Look at what it says in verses 39 through 41.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:19:00.380]   It says this, "And he," that's Jesus, "he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.460]   sea, 'Peace, be still.'
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.860]   And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.780]   And he said to them, 'Why are you so afraid?
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.820]   Have you still no faith?'
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.300]   And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, 'Who then is this that even
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.380]   the wind and the sea obey him?'"
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.860]   So Jesus gets woken up and what does he do?
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.840]   He begins to talk to the sea.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.820]   And I love it because in the original language of the New Testament, those words, "Peace,
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.980]   be still," do you know what they literally mean?
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.060]   It literally means be muzzled.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.340]   So I don't know what type of image you have of Jesus in your head when you think about
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.440]   him calming the storm.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:53.380]   But if your picture is of a meek and mild Jesus, kind of groggy, standing up, he's like,
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.380]   "Oh man, peace, dude, peace, peace, be still."
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.700]   No, it's be muzzled.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.820]   It's shut up.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.940]   Be quiet.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:15.100]   I love that idea of like putting a muzzle on a barking dog.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.100]   There was this TV show that used to be on a long time ago.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.780]   It's called "The Dog Whisperer."
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:27.660]   I don't know if anyone in here ever encountered Cesar Millan is the dog whisperer.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.660]   This show was fascinating.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.420]   If you never saw it, let me just fill you in.
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.340]   Just try and picture this in your head.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.820]   Like the show would start with a montage of clips of an unruly dog.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:44.340]   I mean, the dog would be like biting its owner and barking at everyone that walked by and
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.580]   like eating the couch like in one swallow.
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.500]   Like it was nuts.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:55.160]   And then Cesar would like pull up in his car and walk up to the door and knock and walk
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:01.900]   in and like within three seconds of Cesar being there, Cesar would just walk in, look
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.380]   at the dog and here's, this is all he would do.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.380]   This is it.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:11.420]   He would just go, "Hey, hey."
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:18.340]   And the dog would like stop eating the couch, look at Cesar, do the head tilt and fall over
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.340]   and die.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.660]   It was crazy.
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.300]   It's crazy.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.820]   He's the dog whisperer.
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.540]   And I think about that and I read this and I'm like, Jesus is the sea whisperer.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:36.460]   He stands up, he's like, "Shut up, put a muzzle on it, be quiet."
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.820]   And in a moment in time, that sea goes from chaotic to calm.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.380]   This is the power of Jesus.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.860]   This is why I say you don't have to be in control because Jesus already is.
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:54.340]   Have you ever thought about the fact that Jesus was sleeping in the middle of a storm
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.180]   when everyone else on the boat is like, "This is it.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.380]   This is how my life ends."
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.580]   And he's just asleep.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.820]   He has to be woken up.
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:11.540]   Why was Jesus able to sleep in the midst of a, "I think we're going to die" type of storm?
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.360]   Because he wasn't threatened by the storm.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.700]   He was already in control of the storm.
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.420]   Those waters had been created by God simply saying the word.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.820]   Surely they could be calmed in the exact same way.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.460]   And so can you just imagine if the great calm of the sea could become the great calm of
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.020]   your soul?
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:41.260]   Like when was the last time you just experienced peace?
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.420]   Like when I say that, when's the last time?
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.820]   Like try and date it.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:56.460]   When's the last time you didn't have just that churning inside of you of stress?
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.780]   Like if you want the great calm of the sea to be the great calm of the soul, here's the
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.780]   good news.
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:05.660]   The apostle Paul, who wrote the majority of the New Testament, he helps us navigate the
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.660]   way.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.380]   Here's what he says in Philippians chapter 4, verses 6 through 7.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.180]   These are two verses that are great to commit to memory.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.180]   But here's what he says.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:25.220]   He says, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer, in supplication,
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.340]   with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:41.100]   In the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.100]   Jesus."
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.380]   Okay, so this is it.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:49.500]   Like if you want to experience peace, Paul is showing us the way.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.620]   So let's just break it down.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.620]   He says what?
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.260]   He says, "Do not be anxious about anything."
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.900]   Do you know what that is?
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.900]   That's a command.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.340]   It's not a suggestion.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.060]   That's a command from God through Paul to you.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.820]   Do not be anxious about, and what's the next word?
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.740]   The next word is anything.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.660]   Do not be anxious about anything.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.980]   Do you know what the word anything means in the Greek?
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.580]   It means anything.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.580]   That's it.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.860]   Do not be anxious about anything.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.220]   And if you have a Bible, I just want you to look.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.940]   Do you have an asterisk next to the word anything?
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.180]   No.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:32.060]   There's no asterisk pointing you to a footnote where Paul caveats his statement with the
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.140]   things that it is okay to be anxious about.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:43.420]   Do not be anxious about anything, asterisk, footnote, except when inflation is happening.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.980]   And you know what?
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.180]   Life is crazy right now.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:54.140]   Do not be anxious about anything, asterisk, footnote, except when you're single and you
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.460]   don't want to be.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.780]   Do not be anxious about anything, asterisk, footnote, except when you lose your job and
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.340]   you don't know what is next.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.380]   Now the command is do not be anxious about anything.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.460]   And let me just say this.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.700]   Some of you in here, you heard me start tonight by saying that stress isn't inevitable, it's
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.700]   actually optional.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.340]   And now you're hearing me say it's a command, do not be anxious about anything.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.940]   And that is stressing you out.
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:30.460]   So I just want to acknowledge that there is a clinical diagnosis of anxiety.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.220]   And that is a real thing.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.340]   And so when you hear me say, don't just, don't be anxious about anything, I'm talking to
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.900]   the majority of people in this room that our stress is situational.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:47.820]   But you know what, if you have a clinical diagnosis, hey, it is okay to get help for
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.180]   that.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.980]   It's okay.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:58.020]   But what I want the majority of people in here to hear is this is a command, do not
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.220]   be anxious about anything.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:06.580]   But then Paul goes on and says this, but in everything, but in everything.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.140]   What's the Greek of everything?
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.140]   Everything, everything.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.380]   You name it, it counts, but in everything, by what?
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.100]   By prayer and supplication.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.220]   Here's what Paul is saying.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:22.540]   He's saying if it's stressing you out, God cares about it and you should talk to Him
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.540]   about it.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:28.740]   So let me just ask you this, whatever is stressing you out right now, have you talked to God
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.740]   about it?
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.940]   Here's what I didn't say.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.940]   I didn't say have you talked at God about it.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.780]   I asked you, have you talked with God about it?
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:47.100]   To talk at God about it is simply to allow God to eavesdrop on you as you process through
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:53.020]   what you're going to do to try and figure out your situation to try and get back in
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.060]   control.
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:02.860]   To talk at God about it is to go through the spiritual motions, but in the end, you're
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.700]   still going to try and quarterback your life.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:12.140]   You're going to still try and control something that you can't control.
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:17.900]   So what I'm asking when I say have you talked to God about it is I'm asking you, have you
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:24.580]   gotten on your knees and have you just said, God, I can't, but you can.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:30.260]   Like my shoulders are not sturdy enough to shoulder this thing that's going on in my
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.260]   life.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.260]   So you know what?
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.140]   I'm going to control it onto your shoulders because your shoulders are sturdy enough for
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.900]   it and I trust you.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.100]   And then at 15 minutes later, you know what?
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.980]   When you start stressing out again, you're going to get on your knees and you're going
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.140]   to be like, God, okay.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.620]   So I'm stressing out again because I'm trying to control my life again.
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:54.460]   And so I just want to acknowledge that you, Jesus, you are before all things and in you
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.460]   all things hold together.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:02.460]   So I'm going to trust you with the next 15 minutes of my life that you are in control.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.900]   I trust you.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:09.020]   Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.220]   Now watch this.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.700]   With thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.100]   Did you see that?
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.860]   It feels like Paul says, I want you to pray to God about it.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.100]   I want you to thank God and I want you to let him know what you need.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:30.660]   It feels like he got things out of order with that thanksgiving, like right there in the
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.660]   middle.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.420]   It's like Paul was like, well, shoot, erasers don't exist yet.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.020]   And I wrote it and, but I got it out of order.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.740]   All right, we'll send it to print.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:50.940]   Like it's what we want it to be is you stress out, you ask God to do something.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:56.540]   God does something and then you say, thank you for it.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:02.500]   Paul is saying you stress out, you talk to God about it.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:08.660]   You thank him in the middle of it and you wait and watch for him to do something.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:13.940]   Do you know what it looks like to thank God in the process?
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.340]   It's to look back and thank God for what he's already done in your life.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:24.100]   Because when you look back and you remember that God has been faithful, it reminds you
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.740]   that he's capable.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.360]   He's been faithful with your past.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.140]   He's capable in your present.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.620]   So I want you to try just thanking him for what he's already done.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.740]   And then I want to encourage you to thank him for what he's going to do.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:44.980]   This isn't like some like prosperity gospel, like God, I thank you that you are going to
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.700]   give me a wife tomorrow.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.740]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.860]   This isn't thank you God that when I go to the mailbox, there will be a check in the
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.860]   name of Jesus.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.860]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:30:01.340]   No, I'm talking about like God, I thank you in advance that your will for my life is good,
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.020]   pleasing and perfect.
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.700]   I don't know what you are going to do.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.980]   Honestly, God, I can't see a way out of this thing.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:16.140]   But I thank you in advance that I am in your hands and I am safe there.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:22.820]   And the worst thing that could happen, the worst thing that could happen is that you
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.340]   take me home to be with you.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.420]   And that ain't that bad.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:35.860]   It just puts it in perspective that God is in control.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.940]   And so he says, do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.780]   with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.380]   Watch this, what will happen?
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.900]   And in the peace of God, that's what we want.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.020]   We want peace in the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.020]   What will it do?
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.700]   It will not, it might, it will guard two things.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.700]   It'll guard what?
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.700]   Your heart.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.020]   It's the seed of your emotions.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.840]   It'll guard your heart and it'll guard your mind.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:14.140]   Can you imagine reaching a place where your mind just, it just stops racing for five minutes.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:20.380]   It stops trying to solve the equation and you can just rest even in the midst of the
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:25.620]   unknown.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:33.260]   Paul is saying, this is what it looks like to flip the switch on your stress.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:39.860]   Prior to moving to Dallas, I lived in College Station and prior to living there, yep, it's
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.580]   good to see you, Ax.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:48.140]   Prior to College Station, we lived in Waco.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:55.820]   And when we lived in Waco, it was when my kids were really young and we were renting
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.620]   a three bedroom house and I officed out of my bedroom.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.220]   It was just, it was pretty depressing.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.940]   It was like a chair in the corner of my bedroom.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.620]   That was my office.
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:09.100]   And the ministry that I led, it met on Monday nights.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:14.440]   And so a 6 p.m. on Monday nights was like go time of me trying to figure out exactly
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.580]   like where are we going tonight, God?
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.220]   Like what are we getting, what do you want to do?
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.460]   Well, 6 p.m. was also meltdown time for my kids.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:29.460]   And so a good friend of mine figured that out and he bought me this $200 pair of Bose
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:36.780]   noise canceling headphones, which was amazing because like diapers could be exploding and
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.860]   kids could be melting down and all I had to do was put these headphones on and flip a
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.580]   switch and my life would go from chaotic to calm.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:50.900]   I know this makes me sound like a really bad dad, but I'm just telling you reality, that
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.940]   the switch would get flipped.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:57.780]   And Paul is saying if you want to flip the switch on your stress, here it is, don't miss
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:58.780]   it.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.780]   Look inward instead of inward.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.220]   Do you know what stress really is?
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:09.260]   It's a distress signal of your soul that you're looking inward instead of upward.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.640]   You are actually made to look upward at God for your help.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:19.580]   But our tendency is to look inward to try and figure it out ourselves.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:25.060]   You don't have to be in control because Jesus Christ already is.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.980]   The final truth that I need you to know if you want to address your stress is this, when
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.660]   you can't control life, you have two options.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.380]   Here they are, fear or faith.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.960]   Those are your two options.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   Why do I say that?
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.780]   It's because of what Jesus said right there at the end.
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.460]   Did you see what he said?
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:47.140]   He said, "The wind ceased," and there was a great column, verse 40, he said to them,
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.580]   "Why are you so afraid?
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.900]   Have you still no faith?"
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.660]   So Jesus is giving them the options.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.340]   He's saying, "Look, why did you freak out?
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:01.520]   Why did you choose fear when you actually had a second option?
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.060]   You could have chosen faith."
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.060]   Why?
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.780]   Because I'm in your boat.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.860]   I'm in your boat.
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:14.380]   The one who simply has to say the word is in your boat.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:22.220]   The natural response to seasons of life where we feel out of control is fear.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:27.180]   Stress is simply our response to the unknown.
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:32.860]   It's really just fear of not being able to control the outcome.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:36.860]   It's not being able to see around the corner to see if everything's actually going to work
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.860]   out.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.860]   That's all stress is.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.740]   It's just fear of the unknown.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:48.740]   The normal natural response is stress.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:53.980]   And yet maybe God brought you here tonight so that you could simply hear that you have
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.980]   another option.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.980]   It's faith.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.980]   Why?
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:57.980]   Because he's in the boat of your life.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:04.860]   The one who simply has to say the word is in the boat of your life.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.420]   And he cares.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.380]   He cares about your life.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.180]   Like if you ever question if God cares for you, all you have to do is look at the cross
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.300]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.900]   Like if you ever wonder if Jesus cares about your peace, all you have to do is look at
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.900]   the cross.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.700]   Listen to what Colossians 1 says.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.020]   It says this, "For in him," that's in Jesus, "all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:35.780]   and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven, making
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.740]   peace by the blood of his cross."
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.980]   So here's what that's saying.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:46.020]   It's saying the reason that we remember and we reflect on and sing about and talk about
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.900]   Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection is because Jesus died, was buried, and rose from
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:55.820]   the dead so that we could experience peace.
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:01.860]   See whether you realize it or not, every single one of us finds ourselves in a life-threatening
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.860]   storm.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.960]   It's the storm of sin.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.660]   Every single one of us, whether we realize it or not, we are not born right with God
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:14.700]   because not one of us lives the perfect life that God requires.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:21.260]   And so when the storm of sin was threatening to separate each one of us from God for all
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.740]   of eternity, do you know what Jesus did?
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.820]   Is he got on a cross voluntarily.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.500]   He was nailed to a cross.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.300]   He was punished for you and for me.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.820]   He died for your sins and for my sins.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.060]   And when he hung on that cross, what were his final words on the cross?
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.740]   His final words were, "It is finished."
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:50.420]   And that was another way for Jesus to say, "Shut up.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.540]   Be muzzled."
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:58.540]   To the storm of sin that was threatening to separate you and me from God for all of eternity.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.660]   On the cross, Jesus conquered our sin.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.980]   He was punished so that you wouldn't have to be.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:10.860]   He was put in a tomb and he walked out of that tomb victoriously so that his victory
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:17.580]   could become your victory and you could be made right with God, not through your performance,
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:21.380]   but through his perfect work on the cross.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:24.340]   Do you know that piece?
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.340]   Let's get real.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.540]   You might be stressed out about your job.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.500]   You might be stressed out about finances.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:35.300]   You know what you really need to be stressed out about is if you're right with God.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.420]   Because that's the one thing that matters for all of eternity.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.140]   You know what the good news is?
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:44.420]   You don't have to stress out about that if you know Jesus.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:50.700]   Because Jesus is before all things and in him all things hold together.
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:57.700]   And if you know him, then the wrath of God for your sin has been silenced for all of
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.860]   eternity.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:09.100]   And you can enjoy peace with God for all of eternity because of Jesus Christ.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.420]   I want to just answer the question real quick.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:18.460]   If God truly loved us, why would he allow, why would he lead us into situations that
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.860]   we can't control?
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.180]   Let me just tell you one reason why I love the Bible.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.340]   One of the reasons I love the Bible is because it gets us.
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.500]   What was the question that the disciples ran to Jesus with?
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   Look back at the text.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.060]   What was their question?
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.420]   Do you not care?
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.420]   Do you not care?
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.540]   Have you ever had that question to God?
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.720]   God, do you not care that I'm perishing?
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.100]   Do you not care that I don't know what I'm doing with the rest of my life?
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.980]   Do you not care that I don't have a job?
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.580]   Do you not care that finances aren't working right now?
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.640]   Do you not care that I'm lonely?
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.340]   Like the Bible gets us.
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.780]   It's not just a bunch of sugar-coated stories of people who live unrealistic lives.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.580]   No, these were Jesus's closest friends and they're like, "I don't think you care about
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.620]   us."
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.940]   Why does Jesus lead us into situations that we cannot control?
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.400]   Here's the answer.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.540]   Because it gives them an opportunity to show up in our lives.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:23.780]   It gives us, it gives him an opportunity to show up and display his goodness and greatness
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.340]   in our lives.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:34.540]   And what if Jesus knows that there is more joy waiting for you and for me in dependence
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.800]   than in control?
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:43.380]   What if he cares about us more than we care about ourselves and he cares about us enough
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:48.900]   to lead us to dependence upon him instead of us just letting us go trying to control
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:49.900]   our own lives?
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:54.300]   There is more joy in dependence than in control.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.220]   It gives him an opportunity to show up.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.020]   He might not show up how you think he should show up.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:04.380]   He might not stop the storm, but his goodness and greatness might sustain you through the
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.300]   storm.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:13.020]   Like the fact that you're here tonight, that's a demonstration of his goodness.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.140]   Some of you might feel like you're barely standing.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:24.220]   You're still standing because Jesus has allowed you to be sustained through the storm.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:29.580]   I want to finish tonight just by focusing for a moment on Peter.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.580]   Okay?
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:35.260]   And this is so cool, so I hope that you just stick with me for just a few more minutes
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.900]   so I can show you this connection.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.740]   I want to focus for a minute on Peter.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:45.180]   The reason I want to focus on Peter is because Mark, the one who wrote this book, he was
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:51.180]   not an eyewitness of Jesus or of this story.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:59.100]   He was not an eyewitness of this story, and yet this story, it has the details of an eyewitness
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.100]   account.
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.940]   Like it mentioned the other boats around them.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.660]   It talked about the cushion that Jesus was sleeping on.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.580]   Where did Mark get his account?
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.300]   Most likely he got it from Peter.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.820]   Okay?
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.820]   Now here's what we know about Peter.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:21.700]   We know that the question that the disciples asked Jesus, "Do you not care that we are
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.740]   perishing?"
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:26.540]   We know that Peter at least thought that question.
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:31.620]   If you know anything about Peter, there's a good chance he's the one who said the question
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:35.540]   because Peter was kind of a speak first, think second kind of guy.
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:40.940]   But we know that that question at least represents how Peter felt.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:45.940]   So how meaningful that years later, Peter would write these words in 1 Peter chapter
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:46.940]   5.
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:52.660]   He writes, "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:58.100]   time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him."
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.100]   Why?
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:02.620]   "Because he cares for you."
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:07.540]   Like I just picture Peter writing and he says, "Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.540]   God."
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.660]   And I just wonder, we have no way of knowing, but I wonder if as he wrote about the mighty
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.820]   hand of God, I wonder if he pictured Jesus' hand stretched out toward the sea and he's
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:24.700]   like, "Humble yourselves under those mighty hands, casting all your anxieties on him."
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:25.700]   Why?
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.540]   "Because I've run to him and I've questioned if he cares and he's shown up.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.420]   He's calmed the storm in my life.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.780]   I know he cares.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:40.620]   Cares for me, cares for you."
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.220]   Several years ago I was dealing with some anxiety in my own life.
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.580]   And so I went to see a biblical counselor.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.340]   About a biblical counselor is simply someone who takes the Bible and opens it up, listens
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:55.220]   to what you're struggling with, and then speaks to your struggle from the scriptures.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:59.220]   And so just imagine, I go into this counseling appointment, I tell him I'm struggling with
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.860]   anxiety, so what story do you think he turned me to?
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:03.900]   Mark chapter 4.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.500]   So we talk about Jesus calming the storm.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.500]   Thanks a lot, counselor.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   Really good.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.500]   That's great.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.620]   Really appreciate it.
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:15.020]   Before the session ended, though, this is where the gold was in the session.
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:21.460]   He said, "Hey, you have to see the connection between Mark chapter 4 and Acts chapter 12.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:26.460]   In Acts chapter 12, you don't have to turn there, but in Acts chapter 12, here's what's
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.460]   going on.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:34.380]   At the beginning of Acts chapter 12, King Herod has just killed James, a Christian.
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:39.620]   And King Herod sees how pleasing it is to the people that he has just put a Christian
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:44.100]   to death, that he arrests Peter.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:52.060]   And so we are left to assume that King Herod intends to put Peter to death.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.780]   Now watch what we find Peter doing.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.780]   Here's what it says.
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.780]   This is beautiful.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.180]   Acts chapter 12, verses 6 through 7.
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:02.700]   It says, "Now when Herod was about to bring him out," bring him out to do what?
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.060]   Probably to kill him.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.900]   On that very night, what was Peter doing?
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:16.140]   Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and sentries before the door
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:17.300]   were guarding the prison.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.220]   And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him and a light shone in the cell.
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:25.860]   He struck Peter on the side and woke him saying, "Get up quickly."
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.180]   And the chains fell off his hands.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:33.820]   Here's why I love this so much.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:37.740]   Peter found himself in the midst of a physical storm.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.580]   And in the midst of that physical storm, what was Jesus doing?
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.380]   He was sleeping.
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:47.860]   Jesus Christ went to the cross, rose from the dead, and he had this special moment with
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:48.860]   Peter in John 21.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.820]   And what did Jesus tell Peter?
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.620]   He said, "Hey, Peter, you follow me.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.980]   Follow me."
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:05.220]   And Peter took him so seriously that on another night with a different type of storm, when
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:12.300]   his life was potentially about to end, what does Peter do?
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:16.780]   What he saw Jesus do on the cushion.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.380]   He goes to sleep.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:22.140]   He goes to sleep.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:26.220]   That's peace.
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:35.540]   So if that's the goal, if the goal is to be able to sleep peacefully when potentially
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:40.620]   your life is on the line, can't we all agree that we all have some room to grow?
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.860]   Like we all have a step to take.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.620]   Stress isn't inevitable.
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.660]   It's actually optional.
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.660]   Why?
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:54.140]   Because Jesus Christ is in the boat of your life.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:46:00.020]   The one who simply has to say the word is in the boat of your life, and he cares for
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.060]   you.
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.900]   So choose faith, not fear.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.580]   Look upward instead of inward.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:22.980]   Let's pray together.
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.140]   And I just want to ask you to listen to me right now.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:32.820]   If you're sitting here in this room, and here's the reality, the thing that is stressing you
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:39.820]   out is if you were to die tonight, you don't know where you would be.
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:43.360]   You don't know if you're right with God.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:49.840]   If that's you, you can put that stress to rest right now.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:57.120]   Jesus says, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:02.380]   The scriptures say that all who call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:07.340]   So if that's you right now, if you're sitting there just saying, "I want to know.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.060]   I want to know Jesus.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.060]   I want to be right with him.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.460]   I want peace with God."
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.700]   If that's you, then let me just encourage you right in this moment, would you just pray
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:18.700]   along with me?
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:23.080]   Say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?"
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.540]   Just say, "Jesus, I believe that you died for me.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:31.980]   I believe that you rose from the dead for me."
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.660]   Just say, "Would you come into my life?
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.740]   Would you forgive me of all of my sins?
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.940]   Would you make me right with God?"
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:47.340]   Just say, "I want complete peace with God."
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:53.940]   And then just tell him, "Would you begin to lead me in a new life as my Savior and as
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:58.740]   my King?"
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:03.060]   And then let me just ask, whoever is in here, I mean, the majority of the room, raise their
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:07.840]   hands that they feel stressed out, overwhelmed, out of control.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.660]   If that's you, like, do business with the Lord now.
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.020]   Look upward now.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:16.640]   Don't just talk at God, talk with him.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   Invite him in.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.040]   Roll your stress onto his shoulders.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.040]   Invite him in.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.880]   Express your desperation for him to move.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:28.800]   And at the same time, ask him to sustain you through the storm.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:35.520]   If he chooses not to stop it, would you just ask him to sustain you through it?
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:40.400]   Lord Jesus, we need you.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.620]   You are the Prince of Peace.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.440]   You are the one who simply has to say the word.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:51.640]   I just pray that you would come and calm our souls.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:57.800]   I pray that we would all sleep better tonight than we have slept in a long time.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:03.440]   I pray that for many of us, our brains would just turn off for a few minutes.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:10.120]   I pray that that gnawing sense of stress or anxiety would just fall silent for a little
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.120]   bit.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:16.680]   God, because you, Jesus, are in the boat of our lives and you care.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.640]   Tonight, Lord Jesus, we choose faith.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:23.280]   We choose to believe that you have been faithful in the past.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.120]   You are capable in the present.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:33.720]   And one day, we'll spend all of eternity with you, celebrating your faithfulness in the
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.900]   past, present, and forevermore.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.540]   We need you.
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.860]   We love you.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.080]   In Jesus' name, amen.
