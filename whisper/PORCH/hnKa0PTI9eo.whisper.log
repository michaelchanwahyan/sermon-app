[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   (phone ringing)
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.740]   (phone dialing)
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.540]   - You have seven unheard messages.
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.220]   - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.
[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.280]   I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.740]   - Hey yo, Danny!
[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.420]   Where you at, bro?
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.260]   I'll see you soon, all right?
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380]   - Hey, so I have moved on,
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.740]   but I feel like the Lord keeps putting you back
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.660]   on my heart for a reason, so please call me back.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.020]   - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.340]   but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.820]   She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.260]   So hit me back, love you, bro.
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.020]   - Not sure if this is the right number,
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.940]   but last night was a mistake.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.860]   I was just hoping we could keep that between us.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.100]   - Hey, just wanted to say,
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.900]   I don't think I can make it tonight.
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.180]   Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately,
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.640]   and we need to talk.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.940]   - All right, Ports, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.580]   You doing okay?
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.220]   It's great to see you.
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.380]   Everybody in the front, y'all doing good?
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.620]   Everybody in the top, you doing all right?
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.780]   It's amazing to be here.
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.660]   So glad that y'all would choose to join us
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.820]   as we're continuing through our dating series,
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.660]   We Need to Talk.
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.860]   I'm so excited for where we're going,
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.000]   but we need to say hello to a couple of people
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.820]   that are joining us here tonight.
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.820]   Number one, we want to say hello
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.100]   to everybody that's joining us in the chapel.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.980]   We're so grateful that y'all would make the time
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.100]   and kind of stay steadfast to the cause
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.460]   and not give up on the evening,
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.020]   though you may not have gotten a seat in this room.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.700]   We're so glad that you would be here with us.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.860]   And then we're so grateful
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.220]   that the work God's doing in Dallas
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.160]   is a work he's doing in other cities all over our nation,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.740]   particularly those cities
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.300]   where we have Porch Live locations, just like this one.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.820]   So shout out to all of you guys,
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.260]   but very particularly Porch Live, Greater Lafayette,
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.440]   Porch Live, Fresno, and Porch Live, Scottsdale.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.860]   Well, Porch, there was a moment early
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.320]   in mine and Brooke's dating experience
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.700]   that to this day is still the stuff of hot debate.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.020]   And so what I wanted to do
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.820]   is I wanted to let you into the chat
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.700]   and see if you could help us settle the dispute.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.540]   Does that sound okay?
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.980]   Are you up for that?
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.620]   So it was at this time in our relationship
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.540]   where we weren't even officially dating yet.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.040]   You see, we'd spent a lot of time around each other,
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.820]   and we had even piqued one another's interest.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.060]   But for a variety of reasons,
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.300]   namely I had some commitment issues,
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.660]   we had not gone out on a date yet.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.020]   And yet that was all gonna change.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.260]   Like I had finally run my course and had my fill,
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.140]   and I was ready to ask her out.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.540]   And so I knew that is all going to finally change
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.580]   at the annual organizational Christmas party.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.260]   This is the moment that I was waiting for.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.780]   Like I knew this was the time
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.580]   when we would have the perfect moment in the perfect place
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.820]   to be able to look one another in the eye
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.100]   and say that we're gonna go out together.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.380]   And so I made up my mind coming into that evening,
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.900]   by the end of the night, I was going to ask her out.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.700]   And simultaneous to that,
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.260]   she had made up her mind completely separate of me
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.380]   that if I didn't ask her out, she was gonna move on.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.740]   And so the evening came,
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.980]   and I was in leadership of this kind of club thing
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.820]   that we were involved in.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.900]   So I had some duties to the people.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.340]   And by the end of the evening,
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.020]   after I'd said goodbye to all of our guests,
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.940]   and I had made sure to say hello to some friends,
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.540]   and I kind of closed the event down,
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.460]   I knew that perfect moment in that perfect place
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.500]   had finally arrived.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.900]   And so as I'm making my way to ask her,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.180]   "Hey, will you go on a date with me?"
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.740]   It was right in that moment that I got sidelined
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.280]   by another person, a girl at that,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.440]   which required a long conversation of me
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.960]   because there was something really big happening
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.020]   in her life, and she wanted to be able to process it.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.580]   It certainly didn't help optics that I was talking to her,
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.420]   and I wasn't talking to Brooke.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.660]   And yet I concluded that conversation swiftly,
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.220]   and I started searching, trying to find where Brooke was.
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.660]   She'd already left.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.260]   And I was gutted.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.060]   Like this was that moment.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.140]   Perfect time, perfect place.
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.580]   It was Christmas.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.340]   Like merriment was in the air.
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.940]   The lights were twinkling above.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.060]   The night sky was cool and refreshing to be out in.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.140]   But not to be deterred, I decided I was going to call her.
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.740]   Now we'd hung out a lot, but I had never given her a call.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.420]   There had never been a good reason to,
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.080]   and yet now I had the perfect reason to.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.840]   And so I decide, you know what?
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.140]   Hey, a call is not exactly the picture perfect scenario,
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.280]   but she's gonna see my name pop up.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.920]   And I mean, that's gonna be surprising to her.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.240]   Like, why might he be calling?
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.800]   And I'm sure he'll have a good reason, and she'll pick up,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.560]   and we'll pick right back up where we would have been.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.360]   And so I dial her number, and it rings,
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.520]   and it rings, and it rings.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.780]   And then it went straight to voicemail.
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.940]   For the love of God, why is this so hard?
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.260]   So I decided to hang up, and I would just wait,
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.760]   by the phone, mind you, until she called me back.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.520]   Only she never did.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.760]   Herein lies the dispute that I need your help with.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.020]   Should I have left a voicemail or not?
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:20.880]   In my estimation, having never called her before,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.960]   knowing that when you see someone who you know
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.400]   in your call log, the natural response is to call them back.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.240]   Yes?
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.480]   - Yes.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   - And yet, in her opinion, if you don't get a voicemail,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.820]   then you don't get a call back.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.880]   Now, the verdict is still out
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.260]   on what we actually think of this situation.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.800]   You see, there's a lot that can be argued about both sides.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.440]   If I really laid my case before you, I have no doubt
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.680]   that I'd get a grandstand of applause,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.160]   and you would all side with me.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.880]   But that's neither here nor there.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.080]   You see, good cases can be made either way.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.580]   And the reason for that is because in dating,
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.320]   there's always room to debate
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.160]   whether someone went far enough.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.000]   You see, that was the issue in our moment.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.920]   I thought I had gone far enough,
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.400]   but she was looking at me and saying,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.960]   "You definitely did not go far enough."
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.680]   And it's in those moments in dating
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.920]   where we can really debate the specifics,
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.520]   but you cannot debate when you've gone too far.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.120]   You see, you can always look at one another
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.440]   and you can wonder, like, should you or shouldn't you
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.360]   bring flowers on the first date?
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.180]   Is it good for you to make sure
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.500]   that you buy all of the meals whenever it is
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.820]   you're together with sidebar guys?
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.060]   If it's a date, then you definitely
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.880]   should be picking up the tab.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.940]   When is the right time for you to start unpacking
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.740]   all of your past romantic history?
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.940]   When does that happen?
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.460]   You see, there's a lot of debate that can happen here.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.820]   But when it comes to those areas
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.180]   of our romantic relationships,
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.960]   we know that in the spots where we've gone too far,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.960]   we often feel that there's not much to discuss.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.600]   We're pretty conclusively convinced
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.960]   when those moments come.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.500]   And the reason we are is because
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.280]   they're associated with negative feelings,
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.560]   things like shame and regret and embarrassment and guilt,
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.360]   things that we don't like to feel,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.960]   those moments that feel like a dark cloud
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.880]   in the midst of a sunny sky over your romantic relationship.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.960]   We're all familiar with those.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.660]   It's convincing when you've gone too far.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.760]   When you started fooling around
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.680]   and maybe you found yourself further physically
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   than you thought you'd ever be,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.600]   or you experimented with the same sex,
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.960]   and at first it was just innocent.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.440]   But then you found yourself catching feelings
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.480]   in a way that you never actually anticipated happening.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.160]   Maybe you met someone at a really low point in your life,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.720]   and at that moment, you became so emotionally entangled
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.280]   that codependency began to creep in,
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.880]   or you slept with one another,
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.120]   even though you swore in this relationship,
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.740]   this time it was going to be different.
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.500]   You see, the reality is going too far
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.860]   is a feeling many of us are very familiar with.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.380]   And it's a feeling that our society
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.920]   is very familiar with too,
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.260]   which is why we've seen the advent of consent culture,
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.040]   this idea where two people,
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.280]   so long as they're under a verbal agreement,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.280]   can have emotionless, boundaryless, and commitmentless sex.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.660]   Because in a materialist culture
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.500]   like we have here in America,
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.220]   you can disassociate what happens to your body
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.420]   from what happens to your mind and your soul.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.200]   And yet, according to one author
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.560]   and a journalist out of the Washington Post,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.820]   a woman by the name of Christine Imba,
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.760]   she argues that couldn't be further from the truth.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.920]   You see, she wrote an article,
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.840]   and I would commend it to you.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.580]   It's called "Consent is Not Enough,
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.340]   We Need a New Sexual Ethic."
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.020]   And in there, she makes the case
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.340]   that the primary argument around consent today
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.900]   is not what's legally correct,
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.180]   but what's ethically correct.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.660]   You see, the debate really revolves around
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.660]   not whether we can do X, Y, or Z,
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.780]   but whether we should do X, Y, or Z.
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.940]   She says this in that article.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.340]   She says, "Making the standard of consent
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.800]   "our sole criterion for good sex
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.080]   "punts on the question of how to conduct a relationship
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.620]   "that affirms our fundamental personhood
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.620]   "and our human dignity."
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.260]   What's she saying?
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.620]   In her estimation,
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.440]   it's impossible to separate one's body from their emotions.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.860]   It's not possible to engage in physical intimacy
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.660]   and not develop a emotional connection with someone else.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.820]   And that's a point that her peers within scholarship
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:41.660]   agree on.
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.660]   I could share with you several,
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.220]   but I'll just give you one.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.960]   Peggy Ornstein, in her book "Girls and Sex,"
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.180]   was doing a variety of interviews on college campuses,
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.460]   and as she was talking to young college women,
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.260]   she found that they perceived hooking up,
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.460]   sober mind you, to be awkward.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.160]   As one freshman girl put it to Peggy,
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.200]   she said, "Being sober makes it seem
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.000]   "like you want to be in a relationship.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.140]   "It's really uncomfortable."
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.320]   What are those college students saying to Peggy
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.980]   as she's concluding her data?
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.980]   They're saying, "I want to experience
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.880]   "the physical pleasure of physical intimacy,
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.400]   "but I don't want the emotional pain
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.840]   "that comes with a real connection."
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.660]   And the same is true for us.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.340]   That's what happens whenever we go too far.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.660]   We don't like the feeling.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.340]   And what the world has done is it's given you two solutions.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.900]   Hey, if you don't like the feeling
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.500]   that you get whenever you go too far,
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.180]   whenever you cross boundaries you shouldn't cross,
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.140]   whenever you slip into places you know you shouldn't go,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.020]   what you have to support your conscience
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.700]   is you can be appeased by way of consent,
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.560]   or you can avoid those feelings by way of alcohol,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.640]   neither of which are very good options.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.820]   I think there's a better way.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.580]   You see, rather than regretting going too far,
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:06.040]   what if we just knew how far is too far?
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.300]   That's what I want to talk with you about today.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.420]   Like, I want to talk to you about how far is too far,
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.820]   which is a really interesting question
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.660]   when you think about it,
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.820]   because when people ask this question,
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.980]   it may be one inquisition,
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.460]   but it's actually two lines of logic.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.740]   People want to know where the line is.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.300]   Tell me, like, where's the line at?
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.100]   And then how close to the line can I actually get?
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.260]   That's what people really want to know,
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.860]   which is a really dumb way of thinking about it.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.100]   Like, why would you want to get as close to the ledge
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.140]   as physically possible,
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.120]   knowing that one wrong movement
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.020]   might lead you slipping over the side
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.300]   and falling into your romantic doom?
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.020]   Why would you ever want to do that?
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.140]   Because it's a thrill?
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.720]   Actually, yes.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.980]   That's why many young adults want to know
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.500]   where the line is.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.500]   They want to know, that way they can avoid messing up,
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.580]   but they can also avoid missing out.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.860]   But here's the thing.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.660]   If you're operating in a romantic context,
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.380]   within a dating relationship to someone else,
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.260]   with that mentality, I don't want to miss out,
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.780]   then the truth is you've already missed out.
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.540]   You see, what we know is that contrary
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.940]   to what most people think,
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.820]   the goal of purity is not just to avoid moving too fast
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.240]   or going too far.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.060]   The goal of purity is also, and actually it's more so,
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.180]   about seeing God as too good.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.340]   That's really what we want,
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.940]   which is why boundaries are really helpful.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.940]   Now, if we're going to talk about boundaries,
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.940]   it's useful to have a common definition
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.900]   that we all agree upon when we're talking about this idea.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.540]   And so here's the idea of boundaries.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.460]   A boundary is a line that guards against temptation
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.380]   for the sake of personal flourishing.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.420]   It's a line that guards against temptation
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.620]   for the sake of personal flourishing.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.740]   And it's often, it's a line that you yourself set.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.820]   You see, many people think of boundaries
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.820]   as trying to box you in.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.060]   But really what boundaries are trying to do
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.780]   is they're trying to build you up.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.340]   You see, a fire can both burn down a home
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.100]   and bring warmth to a house.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.060]   And the same is true in a dating relationship.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.480]   The difference though depends on the boundary
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.820]   that fire is contained within.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.340]   In a dating relationship,
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.780]   the two of you can go up in flames.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.620]   You can be burnt by wrong behavior,
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.020]   or your relationship can become a source of life.
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.180]   It can be a cause for warmth as you date
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.180]   in a way that is both befitting of Christ
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.820]   and blessing to one another.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.300]   So then it begs the question,
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.540]   what kind of boundaries should we have?
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.820]   Well, the apostle Paul,
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.860]   he really begins to unpack that idea for us
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.620]   in 1 Thessalonians chapter four.
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.700]   So if you've got a Bible, you can pull it out.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.620]   1 Thessalonians chapter four.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.700]   While you're doing that,
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.620]   let me just give you a little bit of brief context.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.260]   Paul is writing to a group of young believers
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.580]   in this bustling metropolis known as Thessalonica.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.420]   Thessalonica was a highly diversified
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.580]   and a highly sexualized city.
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.660]   You see, within its streets,
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.220]   things like pagan worship and temple prostitution
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.820]   and serial adultery were rampant.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.220]   It was so common for there to be not a one woman man,
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.920]   but a many woman man.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.140]   One Athenian order by the name of Demosthenes
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.100]   by the name of Demosthenes,
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.060]   he articulates this context
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.920]   to which we're reading into by saying this,
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.760]   this was from his day.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.740]   He said, "We keep prostitutes for pleasure.
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.140]   We keep mistresses for the day-to-day needs of the body.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.460]   And we keep wives for the begetting of children
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.460]   for the faithful guardianship of our homes."
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.700]   You see, what's he saying?
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.540]   We live in a Greco Roman society that is sexually charged.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.940]   And it's into that society that the apostle Paul
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.180]   is writing to this young community of believers.
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.180]   And he's trying to tell them,
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.140]   "Hey, there's a way to order your life
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.140]   so that when you do what is appropriate
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.700]   and you avoid what is inappropriate,
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.580]   there are boundaries that you should follow."
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.460]   And my hope over the course of our time
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.260]   is to help you see the same.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.140]   That within our context,
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.420]   there's a way to live appropriately,
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.980]   to order your life with boundaries
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.180]   so that way your relationships can flourish and not fail.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.620]   And the way that I wanna do it
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.980]   is I wanna give you four ways
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.560]   to know when you've gone too far.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.400]   That's what I wanna do.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.220]   I'm gonna give you four ways
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.580]   to know when you've gone too far.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.220]   The first of which we read about in the opening verses.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.060]   And as we do so,
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.620]   we're just gonna take verse by verse by verse.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.780]   We'll talk about it a little bit
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.300]   until we get to the very end.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.340]   So here it goes.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.180]   First Thessalonians four, starting in verse one.
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:56.080]   He says this, "Finally, then brothers,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.340]   we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.580]   that as you receive from us
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.700]   that you ought to walk and to please God
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.100]   just as you're doing,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.340]   that you do so more and more.
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.140]   For you know what instructions we gave you
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.760]   through the Lord Jesus."
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.340]   So we'll stop right there.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.980]   The first way you know when you've gone too far
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.380]   is your Christianity looks compromised.
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.740]   That's the first.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.140]   That's how you know you've gone too far.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.500]   It's when your Christianity looks compromised,
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.500]   when your behaviors in life
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.820]   don't match the beliefs that you claim.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.620]   Which interestingly is not the case for the Thessalonians.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.100]   Like Paul just described them.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.540]   He said, "Hey, we've become convinced of your faith
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.620]   by way of not only your words, but your deeds.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.480]   You're not just in the business
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.200]   of learning a lot of things about Jesus.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.980]   You are in the business of living those things yourself.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.420]   You want to follow Christ
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.340]   in a way where your life looks like his own.
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.480]   Why is that?
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.420]   What was the cause for them to have this kind of allegiance?"
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.140]   He tells us, "They saw that Jesus was an authority.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.100]   It says that they learned from his instruction."
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.180]   So I'll put it to you like this.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.720]   If you were to go to driver's ed
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.340]   and a 16 year old was sitting there
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.540]   trying to teach you how to drive a car,
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.820]   that would not be very good instruction.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.660]   But if you showed up to driver's ed
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.460]   and Lewis Hamilton was sitting behind the wheel,
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.160]   you better take some notes.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.660]   That guy knows his way.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.100]   He has understood the rules of the road
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.100]   and you will be served well
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.620]   to learn the things that he has to teach you.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.620]   You see, the credibility of your teacher
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.660]   impacts the quality of your learning.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.220]   These Thessalonians, they're looking at Jesus
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.320]   and they're like, "Man, there's no one
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.660]   more credible than him.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.260]   He's one that can teach me the things that I know,
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.420]   not just for some things in life,
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.820]   but for everything in life,
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.620]   even the areas in which I engage romantically
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.660]   with other people.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.820]   He's my authority."
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.460]   And so I listen to him.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.840]   "Poarch, let me ask you,
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.580]   when it comes to dating and relationships,
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.760]   who's your authority?
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.100]   Who are you learning from?
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.940]   Like whose instruction are you sitting underneath?
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.340]   Who is it that's discipling you
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.340]   when it comes to the realm of romance?
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.900]   Is it your buddies?
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.220]   The way that they talk about women?
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.540]   Maybe it's your girlfriends.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.900]   Could be TikTok, significant other.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.860]   Maybe it's none of those.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.060]   Maybe it's your favorite romanticy author,
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.500]   Sarah J. Moss, Rebecca Yarrows.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.380]   Maybe it's a podcast that you listen to,
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.100]   something on YouTube, like whatever,
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.060]   or call her daddy on Spotify.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.540]   I don't know what it is, but there's a good chance
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.460]   you're subscribing to someone else's authority.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.420]   And the issue is when you start to do that,
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.900]   what happens is you start to go too far.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.700]   You see, why is it that our Christianity
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.900]   becomes compromised?
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.700]   Our Christianity becomes compromised
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.620]   when we stop listening to God
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.580]   and we start listening to other people.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.780]   It doesn't even mean that they're bad people.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.220]   It doesn't mean that they have an evil agenda,
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.660]   but there's a difference in listening to good teachers
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.700]   and listening to a godly teacher.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.180]   And Jesus wants to teach you the ways of God himself.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.380]   He wants to spare you from a Christianity
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.180]   that looks compromised.
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.900]   So how is it that our Christianity can look compromised?
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.020]   Well, I wanna share with you a couple of different examples
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.260]   because what I know is this is not just pertinent
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.480]   to physical compromise, though that's true.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.260]   You see, when our Christianity becomes compromised,
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.140]   we know that we have encroached a boundary
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.500]   in not only physical places,
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.900]   but emotional places and spiritual places too.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.820]   And so your Christianity,
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.900]   it can look compromised physically for sure.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.080]   I talk to people all the time and they look at me
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.920]   and they say things like,
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.980]   "Well, how else are you supposed to know it's going to work
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.180]   "unless you move in with each other?"
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.420]   Look, I'll tell you how you know it's gonna work.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.940]   Your relationship's gonna work
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.200]   because you're committed to making it work.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.860]   You do not have to cohabit in order to figure out
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.940]   whether or not we're a compatible couple.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.340]   In fact, if you look at the data,
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.780]   what you realize is cohabiting
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.300]   is not a determiner of marriage material.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.100]   It might actually be one that exposes the opposite.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.140]   According to the research,
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.580]   cohabiting increases the likelihood of divorce,
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.820]   it decreases overall marital satisfaction,
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.020]   and it's directly linked to negative psychological
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.120]   and emotional outcomes for children.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.940]   Meaning a relationship does not last in your life
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.300]   because, "Oh my gosh, he's house trained.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.700]   "I never would've thought he picks up after himself."
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.660]   That's not why it's gonna last.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.740]   It's not gonna work because,
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.900]   "Dude, she loves to cook and I love to eat."
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.860]   That's not why it's gonna work out.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.940]   You're not looking for a roommate,
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.400]   you're looking for a spouse.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.860]   Now, let me be abundantly clear,
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.660]   these aren't bad things to look for.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.980]   And when you get married and you rightly enter a home
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.560]   under the proper covenantal union that God has established,
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.740]   man and wife, you should work through some of these details.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.580]   You don't want your home to feel like
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.380]   a never-ending season of survivor
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.100]   where you're constantly fighting for your life
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.060]   with this other person on the same island.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.380]   That's not what you want.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.620]   But you need to make sure
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.020]   that you're valuing the right things first,
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.220]   that you're looking at them and you're trying to discern,
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.220]   "Are you someone that I can build a life with
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.580]   without pretending we're already
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.740]   in that life together right now?"
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.780]   You need to look at them and you need to see in them Jesus,
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.920]   someone that will serve you even at cost to themself,
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.780]   that will seek your good because they care about you,
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.220]   that will sacrifice because they want your wellbeing.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.300]   You want someone that looks like Jesus.
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.800]   If you find someone like that, I promise you'll work it out.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.580]   But how do we know if we're sexually compatible?
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.580]   What do you mean?
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.780]   Like, are you a guy?
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.880]   Is she a girl?
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.560]   It's gonna work.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.640]   We're laughing, but this is the gray question
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.720]   facing our culture.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.760]   We so often look at one another and we wonder,
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.120]   "But hold on, I've got to know
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.280]   that there's good sexual chemistry here."
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.480]   Oh, so what you're talking about
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.800]   is you're not wondering if your parts fit
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.640]   'cause your parts will.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.680]   What you're actually wondering is,
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.280]   can he strike the right positions
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.600]   or do they know the proper technique?
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.840]   That's really what you wanna know.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.400]   Is this thing going to be good for me?
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.960]   And that is selfish.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.960]   That's so selfish.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.600]   That's not valuing the life of another person,
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.080]   that is valuing your life in their place instead.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.200]   And here's what I want you to know.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.000]   You're not supposed to know if you have sexual chemistry
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.900]   or compatibility before you get married.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.880]   That's why you get married.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.000]   You spend the first few years of your marriage
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.280]   figuring this out together.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.360]   Like that's the beauty of marriage.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.520]   Like sex is meant to be explored
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.240]   between a husband and a wife,
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.200]   not experimented with other people before you ever get there.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.020]   I love it.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.160]   In the book of Song of Solomon,
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.920]   which I'm committed to teaching at some point
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.960]   here at the porch,
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.720]   what I love is you get to chapter four
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.960]   and you see Solomon and the Shulamite on their wedding night.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.580]   And as you enter the bridal chamber with the both of them,
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.300]   what you see is Solomon admire his bride's beauty.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.620]   He explores her body
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.540]   and he does so in a way that dignifies her.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.540]   It says that he starts with her eyes behind her veil.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.540]   And then he moves and he looks at the way
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.140]   her hair falls over her shoulders.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.300]   He sees the whiteness of her smile.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.280]   He describes the scarlet redness of her lips.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.440]   He sees the blush in her cheeks.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.640]   He sees the dignity in her neck.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.520]   And I'll stop there because he gets pretty steamy
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.220]   as he continues to make his way down.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.040]   You see, what you have to know
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.700]   is that sex is meant to be explored.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.120]   Solomon, he didn't enter into that bridal chamber
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.880]   wondering, are we sexually compatible?
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.040]   Let me tell you how he figured it out.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.980]   He took one look at her and he said,
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.000]   I think this is gonna work.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.740]   The same will be true for you.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.920]   So you will compromise your Christianity physically
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.300]   if you fall prey to some line of question like this,
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.940]   but you'll also, you'll compromise your Christianity
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.060]   emotionally if you fall prey to questions like,
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.260]   well, how do I lead my girlfriend?
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.860]   What are you talking about?
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.780]   That is a ridiculous question.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.340]   Now, I know most guys that ask that question
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.860]   are not trying to be ridiculous.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.980]   They're trying to be noble.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.540]   They want to do well at the job.
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.100]   And yet the truth is, though the Bible has a lot to say
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.480]   about the way that men sacrificially love
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.660]   and lead their wives and provide for their homes,
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.420]   it doesn't say a lick about the way boyfriends
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.060]   are supposed to lead their girlfriends.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.260]   And so here's the truth.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.000]   Stop trying to lead her like she's yours
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.660]   when you haven't done what it takes to make her yours.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.100]   Like when Brooke and I were dating,
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.280]   there came a moment in our relationship
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.140]   after we'd been together for a considerable time.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.540]   And at the end of that, and after that time,
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.580]   there came a moment where she was getting
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.860]   different job opportunities in different cities.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.460]   And it looked like the severing of our relationship
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.300]   was at hand.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.820]   And yet I looked at her and I said,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.200]   hey, I know we've talked about this,
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.620]   but you don't belong to me.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.100]   You're not mine.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.160]   We're not married.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.460]   You follow God.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.620]   He's the leader of your life.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.260]   And I trust that he's going to work this thing out
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.660]   if he wants it to be.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.780]   He leads my life.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.780]   He leads your life.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:33.820]   And the same is true for you.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.700]   God is the leader of your life.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.540]   Yes, some of those things change
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.500]   whenever you enter into the marriage union,
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.520]   but only then do you start to see leadership roles shift.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.740]   But for now, you lead you and she leads her.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.420]   I could get into the whole point of,
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.620]   well, aren't I supposed to guard her heart?
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.700]   No, you're not supposed to guard her heart.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.780]   She's supposed to guard her heart.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.060]   That's her job.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.460]   You're supposed to guard your heart.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.220]   You think about yourselves as you think about one another.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.060]   That's the way this thing works.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.560]   And then you compromise your Christianity,
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.220]   spiritually speaking,
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.900]   whenever you find yourself in spots
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.120]   where you're trying to get your significant other
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.820]   to be a part of church or Christianity alongside you.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.420]   I get this question all the time.
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.380]   I'll sit down, I'll stand up here,
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.220]   and people will come talk to me,
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.040]   and they'll be like,
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.280]   how do I get my boyfriend to come to church with me?
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.640]   How do you get them to?
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.580]   You shouldn't have to.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.900]   Like the Bible is very clear.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.100]   2 Corinthians 6, 14 tells us,
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.660]   do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.780]   For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness,
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.920]   or what fellowship has light with darkness?
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.780]   You see, your partner should love God
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.560]   before you ever enter the picture,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.060]   not because you entered the picture.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.540]   But they're such a nice guy.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.380]   That's great.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.420]   Send them a thank you card.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.460]   You're not looking for a good person.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.420]   You're looking for a godly person.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.740]   That's what you're after.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.780]   You want to link up with someone where,
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.500]   as my friend and the director of discipleship
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.460]   here at the porch says, Tyler Moffat,
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.140]   your of courses match their of courses.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.500]   That's what you want.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.180]   And their of courses need to match yours
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.020]   on the biggest issue in the cosmos,
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.980]   which is what do you do with the person of Jesus?
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.780]   You need to agree about the claims of Christ.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.420]   Now, I could go on, but the bottom line here is,
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.980]   if you feel like you're bending your Christian integrity,
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.260]   or you're suppressing your spirituality
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.540]   just to be with someone,
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.220]   then you've gone too far.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.580]   Jesus never compromised.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.500]   He never compromised when he came for us.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:31.300]   He was faithful to you in the past, in the present,
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.740]   and he will be for all time.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.900]   And so you don't compromise yourself for someone else.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.140]   He's shown you the way to love, so you follow his way.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:44.420]   And the second we pick up is in verses three through five.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.580]   It says this, "For this is the will of God,
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.100]   "your sanctification,
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.020]   "that you abstain from sexual immorality,
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.260]   "that each one of you know how to control his own body
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.600]   "in holiness and honor,
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.440]   "not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.520]   "who do not know God."
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.580]   So the second way you know you've gone too far
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.680]   is if your behavior becomes disrespectful,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.460]   is if your behavior becomes disrespectful.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.360]   It's interesting.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.360]   Paul tells us very clearly what God's will is for your life.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.140]   If you've ever wondered, here it is.
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.980]   He tells you.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:16.980]   And it's not first and foremost studying the scripture.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.260]   It's not first and foremost serving the poor.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.500]   It's not first and foremost sharing the gospel.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:26.500]   And it's not first and foremost seeking the lost.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.440]   He tells you the will of God for your life
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.200]   is your sanctification,
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.680]   and that comes by way of abstaining from sexual immorality,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.320]   which is interesting, right?
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.560]   No one would have guessed.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.560]   So what is it about abstaining from sexual immorality
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.200]   that particularly looks like Jesus?
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.240]   Well, Paul tells us.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.800]   He says that when we abstain from sexual immorality,
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.620]   it teaches us how to control our bodies
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.160]   in holiness and honor,
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.780]   in a way that considers God
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.500]   and in a way that considers others.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.740]   I think Ben Stewart put this most profoundly.
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.300]   He said that we conduct our lives in a way that reflects God
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.500]   and it respects others.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.980]   That's the idea that Paul's getting at here.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.220]   But when we don't, that's when we've gone too far.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.580]   That's when we become lost in the passion of lust,
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.980]   which is what Paul says here,
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.460]   which is a pretty intense idea.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.460]   Like no one wants to be lost in the passion of lust,
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.720]   and yet the truth is this often happens to us
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.880]   more frequently than we care to admit.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.920]   And the reason for that is because we don't take abstaining
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.800]   from sexual immorality as seriously as we should.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.040]   That idea for abstaining,
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.420]   it can also be interpreted as fleeing,
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.040]   meaning that you're trying to create
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.960]   as much distance as humanly possible,
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.520]   as fast as humanly possible
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.360]   between yourself and the object of your dread.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.820]   So hypothetically, if you're fleeing the scene of a crime,
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.720]   you're not sticking around to shake hands and kiss babies.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.560]   You're not trying to see,
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.280]   "Hey, who's really working up the case?"
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.640]   No, you're hitting the road.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.120]   Like you're getting out as fast as possible.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.080]   You're running for the hills.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.920]   Why?
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.360]   Because there are consequences to your actions
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.960]   and you don't want them to come to bear.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.480]   You flee the scene as fast as possible.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.720]   If we don't flee sexual immorality,
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.520]   there are consequences too.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.720]   And we will pay them if we're not careful.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.820]   First Peter 2 11 says, "Beloved, I urge you
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.920]   as sojourners and exiles, people that are not of this world,
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.340]   but people of a different world,
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.940]   to abstain from the passions of the flesh,
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.000]   which wage war against your soul."
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.860]   You see, Peter's saying, "Hey, your soul is under attack.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.040]   And so you should flee sexual immorality.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.420]   You should create as much distance from it as possible."
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.860]   And yet here's the thing,
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.220]   rather than flee sexual immorality,
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.720]   we often just choose to flirt with it.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.120]   That's what we do.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.920]   We often find ourselves not fleeing, but flirting.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.700]   Like we watch porn,
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.480]   even though we know Pornhub profits
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.080]   off of filming rape and sexual assault
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.420]   and child sex trafficking.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.280]   Or we indulge sexting,
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.880]   not because I'm actually romantically interested
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.760]   in that person, but just because it feels good to be wanted.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.960]   Or we find ourselves listening to erotic romance
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.640]   on audio book.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.500]   And the reason for it is because I could read it,
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.940]   but man, it's so much better to hear not one,
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.420]   but two voice actors tell every spicy detail to one another
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.660]   and let my imagination run wild.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.320]   Or it's the fact that we'll hit up OnlyFans.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.100]   And we have no consideration
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.700]   for the cycle of sexual solicitation
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.200]   those girls are trapped within,
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.340]   just because it helps us to scratch the itch and get off.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.240]   You see, even though we don't go as far as we could,
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.040]   we so often go further than we should.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.140]   And the reason why is because
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.480]   we're like my roommate who never cleaned his room.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:50.400]   Like, sure, we'll tidy the place up a bit.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.720]   We'll hang up our clothes, put our shoes away,
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.080]   make sure our towels hung up and drying.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.600]   We will give the appearance of cleanliness.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.920]   But deep down, if you peel through the layers,
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.000]   what you'll actually find is filth.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.120]   This is too often what we do when we don't flee,
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.380]   but we flirt with sexual immorality.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.780]   And the thing is, this is not just talking to us
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:19.040]   about the ways that we're sexually deviant or disrespectful.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.500]   It also, it has something to say about the way
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.000]   that we're emotionally deviant or disrespectful,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.320]   something that's rampant in our day.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:30.320]   So ladies, that little voice in your head
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.040]   that makes you question everything he does,
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.080]   or it assumes nothing is ever right,
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.940]   or it interprets every minor move
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.780]   as a major declaration of love
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.200]   that is not honoring to your man.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.780]   When he looks at you and he says,
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.640]   "Hey, I'm sorry, I'd love to, but I'm busy tonight.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.920]   "How about tomorrow?"
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:53.040]   It is respectful to take him at his word
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.460]   and not infer something that isn't true.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.340]   Well, who's he gonna see then?
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.140]   Is it that girl that he was talking to at the coffee shop,
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.600]   that redhead that stood up from the rest of the crowd?
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.820]   Maybe it's not who he's seeing.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.300]   Maybe he's not seeing anyone.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.700]   Maybe he doesn't wanna be with me.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.820]   Maybe I did something.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.660]   What did I do?
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.060]   Did I come across too clingy?
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.900]   Like, was it the fact that I wanted to see him on Thursday,
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.340]   even though we had plans on Friday?
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.840]   Maybe it's not something that he's going to see.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.900]   Maybe it's not something that I did.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:18.740]   Maybe it's no one.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.560]   Maybe it's nothing.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.420]   Maybe he just wants to chill and he can't chill with me.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.380]   But I'm chill.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.500]   I'm so chill.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.540]   I'll chill all night.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.860]   I'll eat an entire gallon of ice cream
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.300]   'cause I'm that kind of chill.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.260]   I'll prove him.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.100]   Maybe it's none of that.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.340]   Maybe he just means what he's saying.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:43.420]   Maybe he's just telling you, I'd love to, I can't.
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.700]   How about tomorrow?
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.380]   It's honorable to take him at his word
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.380]   and not assume something else.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.980]   You see, you know you've gone too far
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.420]   when your behavior becomes disrespectful.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.940]   And so here's what we have to do, Porch.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.060]   We have to take control of our bodies.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.700]   We have to take captive our thoughts.
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.060]   We have to subdue our flesh.
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:06.620]   And the reason we do is Jesus did all of that for us.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.060]   Jesus controlled his own body.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.060]   He took captive his own thoughts.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.180]   He subdued, mastered his flesh for you.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.260]   And so we should do so for him and for other people too.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.100]   Paul keeps going.
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.000]   He says in verses six and seven,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.420]   "See to it that no one transgresses
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:26.360]   "or wrongs his brother in this matter,
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.860]   "because the Lord is an avenger in all these things.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.420]   "As we told you before and we solemnly warned you."
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.100]   For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.300]   You see, the third way we know we've gone too far
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.100]   is when your partner feels violated.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.900]   The third way you know you've gone too far
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.020]   is when your partner feels violated.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.460]   That's what Paul means when he says,
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.160]   "We should not transgress
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.260]   "or we should not wrong our brother or our sister."
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.300]   It's the same idea of we should not overstep
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.100]   and we should not overreach into someone's life.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.240]   Overstep, it's the idea of going someplace you don't belong.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.060]   So if you trespass on private property, you're overstepping.
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.900]   And overreaching is the idea of taking from someone
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.940]   something that does not belong to you.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.780]   My son does this all the time.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.840]   We sit next to each other at dinner every night.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.680]   And for whatever reason,
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.700]   he likes what's on my plate more than his.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.340]   And so he's constantly just reaching,
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.100]   just wants to get, he'll kick, squirm, fuss
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.700]   until he gets hold of what I have.
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.700]   And yet he can never reach it.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.260]   Why? Because it's not his.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.620]   It's not within his grasp.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.220]   If it was his, I would put it within his reach, but it isn't.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:34.160]   And yet he will overreach trying to get what is not his.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.980]   And we will do the same thing in dating.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.140]   See, Paul is making a case that we hurt people
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:44.040]   whenever we overstep and whenever we overreach.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.600]   Like there's a whole volume of violation
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.080]   whenever we go against the will of another person
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.960]   and we try to take from them what isn't ours
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.000]   and we try to go someplace that isn't ours to go.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.200]   That's why boundaries are important.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.980]   And it's why boundaries are a really good prover
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.280]   of romantic potential partnerships.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.520]   Henry Cloud says it like this.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.780]   He says in his book, "Boundaries,"
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.400]   "We can't manipulate people into swallowing our boundaries
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.860]   by sugarcoating them."
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.680]   No, boundaries, they're a litmus test
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.680]   for the quality of our relationship.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.060]   Those people in our lives who can respect our boundary,
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:21.880]   they'll love our wills, our opinions, our separateness.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.500]   But those who can't respect our boundaries
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.920]   are telling us that they don't love our nos.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.760]   They only love our yeses, our compliance.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.260]   I only like it when you do what I want.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.660]   In other words, bad partnerships are characterized
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.620]   by overstepping and overreaching.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.340]   And this is a really rampant issue in our culture
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.800]   where people take what isn't theirs
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.320]   and they go someplace that isn't theirs.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.000]   It's rampant in our day.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.600]   I could have pulled out so many different examples.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.440]   I had a bunch.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.040]   I had to strip those away because time is of the essence.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.760]   And yet I wanted to share one of them with you
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   because I just thought it was startling.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.760]   According to Pew Research,
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.840]   56% of women under the age of 50,
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.040]   which covers everyone in this room,
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.880]   report having been sent unwanted
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.920]   sexually explicit images or messages.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.800]   Unwanted.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:20.600]   84% of college-aged women, that being 18 to 22,
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.160]   claim to have received the same thing,
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.200]   unwanted sexually explicit images or messages
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.400]   from strangers online.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:32.280]   That is startling, isn't it?
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.000]   It's startling because that covers far beyond
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.880]   more than half of the women in this room.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.080]   That's been your experience, ladies.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.640]   But it's also startling because this has been unwanted
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.580]   and it is totally unwarranted.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.560]   And the crazy thing about it is,
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.680]   while I know in our current liberated sexual day,
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.520]   every solicitor in this moment of these images or messages
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.920]   is not necessarily a male, but by and large,
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.120]   this is typically characterized of the male population.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.880]   Those whom God has dignified with the purpose
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.680]   of providing and protecting his daughters.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.320]   Not preying upon and propositioning them
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.480]   for their own benefit.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.320]   We live in a day where we overstep and we overreach.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.920]   It's more common in our culture than we often realize.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.840]   So how do you know when it's happening
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.020]   in your relationship?
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.340]   Well, I'm gonna give you four categories to consider.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.940]   I could rush these, but I think that these are important.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.920]   So I wanna take our time
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.400]   'cause I wanna make sure you hear 'em.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.240]   The first thing you know if someone's violating you
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.000]   in your relationship is they're pressuring you sexually.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.540]   They're pressuring you sexually.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.160]   Like if someone in your relationship
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.840]   is constantly guilting you to do more.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.240]   I've got sexual needs, baby.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.560]   Like I need you to help me out with these things.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.920]   What they're proving to you
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.280]   is that they don't need more of you,
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.720]   they need less of you.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.480]   If there's someone in your relationship
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.760]   that's always asking for another picture.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.860]   Like it's not like we're having sex.
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.960]   Like we're just kind of fooling around a little bit.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.520]   We're just messing with one another.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.360]   What they're proving to you
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.840]   is that they can make excuses for their sins
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.520]   and they cannot find solutions for their godliness.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.520]   If they're always insisting,
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.060]   hey, like you should come stay the night.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:18.900]   Like we're not gonna do anything.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.600]   We're just gonna sleep right next to each other.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.720]   That person is deceiving you.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.840]   They don't wanna sleep next to you.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.280]   If they do, you've got a different problem on your hands.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.080]   You've gotta be careful.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.160]   Hebrews 13, verse four says,
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.920]   "Let marriage be held in honor among all,
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.720]   "and let the marriage bed be undefiled,
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.440]   "for God will judge the sexually immoral
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.080]   "and the adulterous."
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.160]   You know what that tells you
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.580]   if you're being pressured sexually?
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.600]   That verse tells you that your partner does not fear God.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:54.300]   Because what we know is sexual immorality and adultery,
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.620]   it is judged by God.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.460]   Now, to be very clear, it is forgiven by Christ.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.180]   But we do not sin all the more that grace may abound.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.740]   That's not why we do it.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.960]   No, we relish in the free gift of grace
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.700]   that Jesus gives to those who are genuinely repentant,
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.020]   not just remorseful.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.180]   You want someone who is not trying to defile you,
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.060]   but honor you.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.740]   Someone that will look at you and say,
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.100]   "Hey, you're with me for now,
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.020]   "but I don't know how long we'll have,
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.900]   "but you will be with someone forever,
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.460]   "and I want to honor them as well as you.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.840]   "I want to set you up for success."
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.420]   The next way you know if someone's violating
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:36.300]   in your relationship is they're demeaning you verbally.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.460]   They're demeaning you verbally.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.820]   So listen, ladies, if he's belittling your body,
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.940]   if he is constantly comparing you physically,
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.680]   if he's tearing down your confidence,
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.860]   then get away from him.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.420]   Because if he's quick to judge you on the externals,
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.300]   then he won't be slow to judge you on the internals
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.220]   whenever they become known.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:59.500]   Guys, you need to know if your girl is quick to critique you.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.820]   Like if you bring her flowers and she mocks you
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.500]   because you got her daisies and those are so cheap,
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.540]   or if she chooses to make a joke
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.480]   about some romantic advance you make,
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.240]   you wrote her poetry, you planned a date,
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.380]   you came with questions,
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.820]   and she thinks this is so cheesy or cliche,
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.320]   then get away from that.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.180]   You don't want someone that's going to critique you.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.340]   You want a woman that is going to celebrate your effort,
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.260]   not criticize your results.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.980]   I love this.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.500]   Proverbs 26, 24, 25,
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.900]   it tells us about the dangers of emotionally oversharing.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.860]   That situation where some woman shares with you
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.180]   the deepest longings in her heart,
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.580]   even though she has no business in giving you her heart,
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.540]   this is what Proverbs 26, 24, 25 would say.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:47.040]   It says, "Enemies disguise themselves with their lips,
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.660]   "but in their hearts they harbor deceit.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.820]   "Through their speech, though their speech is charming,
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.100]   "do not believe them."
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.820]   You see, I have seen so many couples suffer
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.540]   under unnecessary emotional manipulation
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.140]   because there's this deep fear
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.620]   that this is the best it's ever going to get.
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.380]   So I'm willing, I will silently suffer
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.620]   so long as it keeps us together.
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.420]   And yet what happens in that situation
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.580]   is you don't walk into a thriving, healthy relationship,
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.620]   instead you fall down into a toxic one.
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.720]   Do not allow for that.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.620]   You deserve more.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:22.080]   Christ, he has died and risen so that you might have it.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.020]   The next thing you need to know
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:30.700]   is they may be controlling you physically.
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.660]   They may be controlling you physically.
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.140]   Like if you're just dating,
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.020]   and that person, your boyfriend, your girlfriend,
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.380]   gets mad because,
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.200]   well, we're supposed to spend the weekends together.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.620]   Again, we've talked about this.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.580]   You don't belong to them.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.220]   Like they have no right to get frustrated
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.420]   unless you made a commitment
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.900]   and now you're going against it.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.340]   They have no reason to be frustrated with you.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.060]   Instead, they need to look at you
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:55.900]   and they need to honor the fact
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.460]   there's separation between the two of you.
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.540]   You have genuine autonomy.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.580]   You're independent persons.
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.580]   And yet I have seen both guys and girls
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.380]   do things like track their boyfriend
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.880]   or girlfriend's location,
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.600]   monitor their transaction history,
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.740]   share their social media
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.120]   because they want to know who they're talking to
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.640]   and when they're talking to them.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.580]   They're controlling them physically.
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.140]   And if someone's doing that in your life,
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.080]   you need to run.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.160]   You got to get away from that.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.540]   That's not safe.
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.100]   Like, listen, Jesus is not someone
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:30.140]   that confirms that kind of control in your life,
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:34.640]   though people have used his name to substantiate such.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.320]   Jesus is not someone that will side with that person
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.400]   and say, yeah, my word authorizes all of this.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.040]   No, Jesus's word does not authorize any of this.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.840]   Jesus, he lives to uplift people,
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.400]   to bring them into a place of flourishing.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.560]   And yet often those that try to physically control us
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.280]   have other things in mind.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.900]   And then the last one is
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.440]   they're manipulating you emotionally.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.920]   I mentioned the way that she or he
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.080]   may emotionally overshare in the hope
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:07.280]   of reeling you in that they have no intent.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.760]   And yet you also need to know that there are people
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.940]   that will always try to make things seem like your fault.
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.840]   They'll try to invalidate your feelings.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.640]   They'll never take ownership when conflict arises.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.040]   They will constantly question your judgment
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.060]   rather than seeking to understand.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.360]   And you should be careful of them.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.400]   I need to keep going, but here's the point.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.680]   God has called us to holiness.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.960]   And because he has, we don't go where we don't belong
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.400]   and we don't take what isn't ours.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.480]   We do the opposite.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.520]   We go where Jesus went.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.360]   Where did Jesus go?
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.520]   He moved towards his beloved.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.240]   And then we do what Jesus did.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.160]   He didn't take, he gave.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.400]   We're willing to give of ourselves
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.440]   that our boyfriend, our girlfriend,
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.840]   and eventually our husbands and our wives might have life.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.360]   That's the thought here.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.880]   And the very last thing you need to see
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.560]   is in verse eight, and we'll go quick.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.280]   It says this, "Therefore, whoever disregards this
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.940]   disregards not man, but God,
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.320]   who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.980]   The fourth way you know you've gone too far
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.520]   is if your conscience has grown cold."
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.020]   If your conscience grows cold.
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.000]   That's what Paul says in the final verses of this section.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.680]   He looks at the Thessalonians and he says,
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.680]   "Hey, there's one more final issue.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.560]   There's one more final warning I need to issue you
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.160]   when it comes to your romantic relationships."
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.560]   He says, "If you disregard any of the above,
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.960]   any of the other three things that we've talked about,
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.400]   then you not only disregard God,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.040]   you not only disregard man, you disregard God.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.320]   And the only way that happens in your life
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.600]   and in your dating is when your conscience has grown cold."
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.820]   Hear me on this.
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.560]   Because this is certainly some of you.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.760]   Some of you are in a relationship tonight
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.320]   where at some point in the past,
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.780]   you knew you'd gone too far.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.160]   I don't know what it was,
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.680]   and I don't know how long ago it may have been,
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.400]   but you know we went too far at that point back then.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.680]   And now you just feel like it's too late
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.480]   to do anything about it.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.320]   It just doesn't matter what point is there.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.120]   Like you've been sleeping together for so long now,
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.200]   it just feels normal or pornography.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.960]   It's been his addiction,
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.520]   and he's brought that into a relationship.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.600]   And though I've begged him to get over it,
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.400]   he's never going to get over it.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.920]   Or you've seen, man, she's cheated,
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.720]   but I just, I don't know that I can do any better.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.080]   And when we're together, it's good.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.920]   But even if she goes unfaithful
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.200]   and she does things with other guys,
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.880]   I'm not willing to give up on this.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.120]   Or maybe it's masturbation.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.800]   Like you think about that, you're like, you know what?
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.840]   I know that I'm not supposed to,
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.560]   but it's really kind of the lesser of all evils,
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.120]   and I need a sexual outlet.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.760]   Or maybe you so desperately just need to be needed by a guy.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.720]   And so you'll do whatever it takes.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.280]   Like you'll wear as little as possible.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.200]   You'll do as much as possible,
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.840]   and you will go however far as needed
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.320]   so that way you can get his attention.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.320]   I don't know what it is for you, but here's the thing.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.800]   If you're thinking, you know what?
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.960]   We crossed the line way back then.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.520]   We're way too far gone now.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.080]   It just doesn't really matter.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.800]   It does matter.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.640]   It matters because you matter.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.320]   God is looking at you and he's saying,
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.960]   "Hey, it's not just that you've disregarded man.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.640]   Don't disregard me.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.440]   I care about you.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.080]   I want you to keep fighting.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.000]   I don't want you to give up already.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   You may feel like you're too far gone, but here's the thing.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.360]   No one has gone too far that I cannot reach them."
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.680]   That is the gospel.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.560]   The long arm of God extends to any and every person.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.880]   No person can outrun his redemption.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.160]   No person can outpace his pursuits.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.600]   He is a God that reaches for the very worst of us
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.000]   and even those that feel like we could not go any deeper.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.040]   And so if you're here and you're thinking,
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.080]   "It just doesn't matter,"
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.840]   you need to know it desperately does
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.920]   because it matters to him.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.080]   You see, you can't outrun him.
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.440]   Doesn't matter how far you feel gone.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.040]   He can still go further
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.200]   because when we'd compromised our Christianity,
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.040]   then we know Jesus, he never compromised us.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.600]   He pursued us anyways.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:06.160]   When we disrespected God by way of going astray in our sin,
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.840]   Jesus never lost sight of you.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.280]   He considered you even still.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.440]   When sin had absolutely violated you,
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.280]   Jesus stepped in and he rescued you.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.840]   Not only that, he restored you.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.240]   Not only that, he redeemed you for all time
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.000]   should you place your faith in him.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.740]   And when our conscience had grown cold,
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:31.760]   so cold as dead in the grave,
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.440]   Jesus brought us to life.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:37.880]   Jesus looked at us and he made us like himself.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.260]   He made us alive.
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.520]   And so here's the thing.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:50.960]   If you want to order your relationship in a way
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.380]   that not only avoids the bad,
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.000]   but it pursues the good,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.520]   then you need to look at Jesus
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.720]   who has ordered his relationship to you
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.180]   in a way that absolutely dealt with the bad,
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:11.680]   but now is advocating for your good.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.600]   He took your sin and he condemned it on the cross.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.120]   He bore it in his body, but he rose forth.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.080]   So then not only would you be forgiven,
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.720]   but you'd have forever should you place your faith in him.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:32.680]   Look to Jesus and see one who pursues us,
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.640]   no matter how far we've gone
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.800]   or how far we feel we've fallen.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.560]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.800]   Lord, we love you and we're grateful for tonight
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.720]   and we thank you for this time.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.120]   I know God, like this talk can feel heavy
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:53.100]   because even as we're walking through some of these details,
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:58.100]   there's a weight, not just in the ideas,
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:02.480]   but in the experiences of them ourselves.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.200]   We see God in our own lives
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.680]   that we've lived through some of this stuff.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.680]   And yet God, I pray that what people would hear
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.800]   is not condemnation,
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:17.920]   for such is not the future of those in Christ.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.000]   I pray instead, they would hear redemption,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.060]   that though their past may be checkered,
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.460]   their future can be white as snow.
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.900]   God, we pray, would you meet with us now?
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.760]   Would you minister to our hearts?
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.240]   Would you call back to mind something we've said
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.760]   that we need to know?
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.000]   And God, would you work in us,
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.780]   not just to be better people, but to become like you.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.220]   We love you and we're grateful for tonight.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.480]   It's in your name we pray, amen.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:57.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
