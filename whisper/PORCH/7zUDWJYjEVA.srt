1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,720
 First off, before we get started here in Dallas, Texas,

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,580
 wanna welcome my Porch Live locations of the night,

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,340
 welcoming Porch Live, Greater Lafayette,

5
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,780
 Porch Live Boise, Porch Live Cincy.

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,080
 We all just helping our friends tonight,

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,220
 listening online, watching in the Porch Live locations.

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,340
 Of course, my friends here in Dallas, welcome.

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,480
 If this is your first time at the Porch, welcome.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,540
 We are venturing into night two of our dating series

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,540
 that we are calling Dateable.

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,000
 Last week, DMarv had a strong start

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,700
 where he just asked the question, hey, are you dateable?

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,340
 We did kind of a self-reflection,

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,780
 kind of introspective look at ourselves to decide,

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,900
 hey, should I even be dating right now?

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,780
 And the next two weeks, we're gonna get a little bit spicy

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,140
 and turn up the notch a little bit

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,140
 because we're gonna ask the questions,

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,900
 is he dateable?

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,400
 And next week, is she dateable?

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,220
 And so tonight, I have, is he dateable?

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,340
 And ladies, we're taking a look at the fellas,

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,580
 but don't look too hard.

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,120
 I'm excited.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,300
 And I wanna go and address

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,300
 kind of like the elephant in the room.

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,940
 Have you ever had one of those conversations where like,

29
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,860
 you know, when you have a roommate

30
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,700
 that doesn't do the dishes

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,940
 and you're talking with your other roommate

32
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,660
 and you're like, that roommate walks by

33
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,900
 and you're like, yeah, someone would do the dishes.

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,340
 And you're like wanting them to hear,

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,800
 but like not address them.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,540
 That's kind of how I feel right now.

37
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,140
 Like I'll be talking to the ladies,

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,020
 answering the question if he is dateable or not,

39
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,120
 but fellas, this talk is for you.

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,340
 And this talk is not to make you feel shame.

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,180
 It's not make you feel guilt.

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,820
 Like there's some unrealistic mountain that you can't climb

43
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,020
 that you have to be perfect.

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,460
 That is not my goal here.

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,220
 Like picture us right now, fellas, in a huddle.

46
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,740
 I'm like, okay, here's the play.

47
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,660
 Let's go change the world.

48
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,480
 Let's go lead women.

49
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,700
 Let's go be awesome men of God.

50
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,460
 Stack hands, let's do this.

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,580
 That's what I hope comes from this talk,

52
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,980
 that you are motivated.

53
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,940
 You are inspired by God and his design

54
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,540
 and his call on your life as a man to pursue

55
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,780
 and lead women the way that he has called us to.

56
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,660
 And so I hope this excites you, not frightens you.

57
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,000
 Ladies, I hope this enlightens you

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,840
 to answer the question, is he really dateable?

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,100
 So I remember a time that I had to answer the question

60
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,920
 if I was dateable.

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,080
 Last December, I drove to Arkansas

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,920
 to take a girl that is now my fiance.

63
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,020
 Her name is Jenna.

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,040
 Yeah.

65
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,480
 Getting married, New Year's Eve, cannot wait.

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,680
 It's gonna be a time.

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,800
 But I met her, I drove to Arkansas.

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,640
 I heard about her.

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
 She worked for the Porch Live location there.

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,420
 Her reputation preceded her.

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,960
 I went, drove, we had a fun night, karaoke,

72
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,000
 hung out with some friends.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
 I brought some guys with me.

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
 She brought some girls with her.

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,760
 And we had coffee the next morning.

76
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,360
 I got that one-on-one the next day, she approved.

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,200
 And then we had a four-hour coffee.

78
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,840
 And I'm like, this is in game.

79
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,320
 This is the one.

80
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,880
 I knew I had found her,

81
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,300
 but I knew that in order for me to ask her

82
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,880
 to be my girlfriend, which I was planning to do,

83
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,400
 New Year's Eve this past year,

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,940
 I had to ask her parents.

85
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,600
 Because my dad raised me, fellas,

86
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,500
 this is just free advice.

87
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,400
 This isn't even my notes.

88
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,140
 This is for you, take this with you.

89
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,240
 When I was in like, I don't know, 10th grade,

90
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,520
 I wanted to like go and like ask her to be my girlfriend.

91
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,200
 And my dad was like, well, if you're gonna ask the girl,

92
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 you gotta go ask her dad first for permission.

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,920
 In 10th grade, me is like, what?

94
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,840
 And I was so nervous.

95
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,840
 And he said, son, what kind of dad would let you,

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,480
 you think that man would let you just walk in his house,

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,040
 take his lawnmower, start it up and walk around with it?

98
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,560
 No, you had to ask for permission.

99
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,700
 He wanted to know, do you know how to operate this machine?

100
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,700
 How much more, how much more does he think that you would,

101
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,180
 or could you think that he would let you walk into his house

102
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,980
 and take out his daughter and date his daughter

103
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,200
 and lead his daughter?

104
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,980
 I'm not calling girls machines.

105
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,100
 But what I am saying, what I am saying

106
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,620
 is that if a dad values a lawnmower,

107
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,860
 how much more does he value his princess?

108
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,240
 And you need to make sure that you ask him for permission.

109
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,600
 So fellas, you wanna go ahead and start off

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
 on the good list?

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,640
 You wanna be like top 10% of men?

112
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,300
 Ask the parents for permission.

113
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,960
 So I thought, I thought this was gonna be an easy thing.

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,320
 I texted, I got the number.

115
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,080
 I'm still, I'm sitting here 27, nervous as heck,

116
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,400
 texting mom and dad.

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,640
 Also her mom's here tonight, Kit Kat, what's up?

118
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,840
 And future mother-in-law, getting those brownie points.

119
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,840
 And so I text them and I'm like, hey, we'd love to talk.

120
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,160
 They know what's coming.

121
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,240
 They're seeing right past the bull crap.

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,920
 And so I'm like, we'd love to set up a call

123
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,300
 and talk to y'all about something regarding Jenna.

124
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,000
 And I'm thinking this is gonna be just so easy,

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,160
 a quick two minute call.

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,360
 They're gonna just be flattered that I would even ask

127
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,400
 and like, what guys do that?

128
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,040
 I thought Chauvelry was dead.

129
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,240
 Let me tell you what happened.

130
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,040
 I get on the phone and I'm like,

131
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,440
 hey, I'm not really good at small talk.

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,340
 So I'm like, let's just cut to the chase.

133
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,440
 I wanna ask Jenna to be my girlfriend this New Year's Eve.

134
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,680
 And before I do that, of course,

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,200
 I wanted to ask you for your permission.

136
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,960
 And I just wanted to give you the opportunity

137
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,080
 to ask me any questions if you had any.

138
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,180
 I'm thinking they're gonna be like,

139
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,080
 no, thank you for asking, go.

140
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,680
 She said, glad you asked.

141
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,640
 And I hear this notepad open up

142
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,800
 and I start hearing writing.

143
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,240
 I'm like, what's she already writing?

144
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,920
 Like 15 ums already, you know, informal presentation.

145
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,960
 I'm like, what is she saying?

146
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,720
 And so she opens up this notepad

147
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,840
 and we proceed to take the next hour and a half

148
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,880
 just drilling me with questions.

149
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
 And I'm like, okay, I'm answering these.

150
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
 I'm, you know, getting here.

151
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,400
 I'm like, I'm staying in the game.

152
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,960
 I'm answering them all.

153
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,240
 We talk about boundaries.

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,060
 We talk about what community in my life looks like.

155
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,560
 We talk about accountability, sin patterns,

156
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,960
 you know, what my life story, all these different things.

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,360
 Why?

158
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,760
 Why did we spend an hour and a half doing that?

159
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,620
 Because her, she, Katherine and her husband

160
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,840
 value their daughter.

161
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,180
 And the more you value something,

162
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,300
 the higher expectations you have of how it's treated.

163
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,940
 And so they wanted to make sure, are you dateable?

164
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,940
 Not because you have to be perfect,

165
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,160
 not because it's something that you can do,

166
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,640
 but do you have Jesus in you?

167
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,640
 And does he mark your life in such a way

168
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,120
 that you have committed everything to him

169
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,760
 and that you are leading yourself

170
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,560
 so that you could lead our daughter?

171
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,240
 Because they knew the way that I operate in now

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,360
 and who I was today as a man

173
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,880
 was gonna impact who she would become as a woman

174
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,460
 if I were to date and lead her.

175
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,860
 So they had a lot of questions

176
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,400
 because they valued their daughter.

177
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,740
 And what I want every single person here

178
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,920
 to take away tonight, if you don't hear anything else,

179
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,320
 I want you to walk away understanding your value

180
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,620
 in the eyes of your heavenly father, God.

181
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,480
 I want you to know that you are worth

182
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,960
 more than what culture says.

183
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,840
 You are worth more than what that guy,

184
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,080
 that bum has treated you like.

185
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,140
 You are worth more than being cheated on.

186
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,980
 You are worth so much and you have so much value

187
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,080
 because every single one of you are made

188
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,680
 in the image of God.

189
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,820
 And so because you have extreme value marked on your life,

190
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,120
 there should be expectations for how you are treated

191
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,420
 and how you treat your life.

192
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,320
 And who you date will have huge implications

193
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,480
 on your today and on your forever.

194
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,720
 So you need to make the decision wisely.

195
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,680
 Ladies, you need to make sure

196
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,500
 that you are asking the right questions.

197
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,680
 Is he dateable?

198
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,760
 And so what we're gonna do here tonight

199
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,480
 is just like Jenna's parents asked me questions

200
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,760
 to determine if I was dateable and good for their daughter,

201
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,640
 we're gonna look at God's word

202
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,960
 and see what he would have to say

203
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,260
 and the questions that he would have us ask

204
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,140
 to find out if we as men are dateable

205
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,980
 to date his daughters.

206
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,720
 Ladies, these are the questions that you should be asking

207
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,020
 to see if he is dateable to date you.

208
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,340
 So three questions.

209
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,340
 And I know when I say looking at God's word,

210
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,800
 you might be thinking, well, wait,

211
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,220
 y'all say all the time that God's word

212
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,440
 doesn't address dating.

213
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,620
 So what do you mean by that?

214
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,260
 And I wanna say that God's word,

215
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,640
 yes, it does not say the word dating

216
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,740
 or thou shalt date this way or ask out this way.

217
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,260
 But what it does talk about a lot

218
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,060
 is the institution of marriage.

219
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,820
 And because we believe here that you should only be dating

220
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,980
 if you're heading towards the destination of marriage,

221
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,780
 we look at what God has to say about marriage

222
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,340
 and we use those practices and those foundations

223
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,160
 to mark how we date so that we can prepare

224
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,020
 for his desire for us to be married in a God honoring way.

225
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
 So that's what I'm gonna do tonight.

226
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,860
 So the first question we're gonna ask,

227
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,560
 the first question for my note takers is this,

228
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,580
 who's leading him?

229
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,660
 If you're a guy, write down, who's leading me?

230
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,540
 Who's leading him?

231
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,260
 And ladies, I wanna make sure I first and foremost address

232
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,260
 that you wanna make sure that you know who's leading him

233
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,900
 and that the answer is not you.

234
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,980
 'Cause that's not your job.

235
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,720
 And I think a lot of times ladies like the job

236
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,980
 of leading their men, or they think somewhere deep down,

237
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,460
 it's up to them to determine his spirituality

238
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,800
 and his spiritual walk with God.

239
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,000
 You think, okay, well, I know that I have a relationship

240
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,200
 with God and I know that he's kind of wishy-washy

241
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,920
 and he doesn't really read his Bible or, you know,

242
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,460
 he does call himself a Christian,

243
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,680
 but he doesn't really go to church.

244
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,680
 But if he dates me and he starts to give me his heart

245
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,800
 and I start to give him my heart

246
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,040
 and we start to fall in love, I can help him.

247
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,340
 I can get him into church.

248
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,000
 I can lead him in the way.

249
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,880
 I can lead him towards Jesus.

250
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,520
 And sure, maybe, maybe you could be of help to him,

251
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,680
 but you are sacrificing something good or something great

252
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,360
 for something mediocre outside of God's design.

253
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,200
 Because God's design is this.

254
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,560
 First Corinthians 11 three says,

255
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,680
 "I want you to understand that the head

256
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,720
 "of every man is Christ."

257
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
 So Christ is up top.

258
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,620
 And the head of a wife is her husband.

259
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,620
 Christ, husband, and the head of Christ is God.

260
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,960
 This does not mean that because the head of a woman

261
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,800
 is her husband, that the man is the leader,

262
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,920
 that the woman is of any less significant value.

263
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,200
 It does not mean that she is any less important.

264
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
 What it does mean is that this is not a matter

265
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
 of rank, but role.

266
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,880
 God has given us roles for a reason, to help us,

267
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,280
 'cause he understands our makeup and wiring.

268
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,160
 Thank God he designed women differently than men.

269
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,040
 He designed women in a way that men are there to help lead.

270
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,960
 And by the way, every biblical term in the Bible,

271
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,980
 when it talks about leadership here,

272
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,280
 is referring to servant leadership.

273
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,480
 You're not finding yourself some chief head honcho

274
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,560
 who loves to waive authority over you,

275
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,860
 or dictate your decisions or control you.

276
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,620
 You are finding the ultimate server,

277
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,660
 because if Christ is Lord of his life,

278
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,320
 Christ we see in Philippians,

279
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,040
 that he was the ultimate servant.

280
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,000
 He came down and humbled himself from heaven

281
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,880
 onto earth.

282
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,280
 He was all about serving.

283
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,360
 And so if we're following and leading by his example,

284
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,800
 we are chief servants.

285
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,440
 We are constantly seeking to serve women by leading them.

286
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,760
 Our leadership at the foundation is constantly thinking,

287
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,840
 what can I do to better her?

288
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,880
 To love her, to care for her.

289
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,080
 Not for myself, but for her.

290
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,200
 But who he leads will determine how he leads you.

291
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,280
 And so you need to ask yourself,

292
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,920
 who or what is leading him?

293
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,080
 'Cause if Christ is not leading him,

294
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,960
 do not let him lead you.

295
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,880
 Second Corinthians 6.14 says,

296
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,560
 "Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.

297
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
 For what partnership or what relationship

298
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,640
 has righteousness with lawlessness?

299
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,200
 Or what fellowship has light with darkness?"

300
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,840
 They're just giving the case here that,

301
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,120
 hey, like it's impossible for light and dark

302
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,440
 to like coexist, you can't do it.

303
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,240
 And so when you try to have a relationship

304
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,120
 that is both God honoring and others focused,

305
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,840
 it's impossible if you have someone who is following God

306
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,000
 and being led by God and someone who's not.

307
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,840
 It doesn't work because the Bible says in 1 John

308
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
 that God is love.

309
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,320
 So if someone doesn't know God,

310
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,360
 how can they know how to properly love?

311
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,240
 How can they?

312
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,600
 And so they're just making the case here,

313
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,680
 hey, if you think that it's up to you to lead them,

314
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,600
 you will eventually be following them

315
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,360
 because that's not your role, that's not your job.

316
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,240
 Women, in asking the question if he's dateable,

317
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,160
 ask yourself, who's leading him?

318
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,360
 Who's informing his decisions?

319
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
 What does he follow?

320
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,400
 What informs his thinking and his patterns?

321
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,200
 Is it Christ?

322
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,080
 Is it himself?

323
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,160
 Is it you?

324
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,080
 Is it people who are bad influences?

325
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,200
 Is it culture?

326
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,640
 You wanna know that it's Christ leading him.

327
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,680
 And I don't mean an Instagram bio

328
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,160
 or like the cross necklace or the cross tat.

329
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,880
 I mean like Jesus is Lord of his life.

330
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,640
 And I don't have to like explain it to you.

331
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,440
 I really think you know what I'm talking about.

332
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,840
 And you can try to make excuses for him,

333
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,160
 but deep down, you know who's leading him.

334
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,480
 And you gotta know it's Christ.

335
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,160
 But I also know that it is getting harder and harder

336
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,560
 to actually know on the outside if a guy is legit.

337
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,280
 Because what his hinge profile bio says

338
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,240
 doesn't match up all the time

339
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,640
 with who he follows on Instagram

340
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,720
 and how he lives and acts.

341
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,440
 And I know that.

342
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,600
 And it's like, where are the actual godly guys?

343
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,920
 I want an actual godly guy.

344
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,760
 Where are they?

345
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,600
 Where are they?

346
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,440
 Where are they?

347
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,280
 I'm gonna answer.

348
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,200
 Here's how you can know.

349
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,800
 Don't look at the bios.

350
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,240
 Don't look on the outside.

351
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,600
 Don't look at his words.

352
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
 Look at his heart.

353
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,000
 Do a heart check.

354
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,200
 So here's just a quick way to remember.

355
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,720
 In heart checking, first check his habits.

356
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,000
 What are his tendencies?

357
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,960
 What are his hurts and hangups?

358
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,400
 Does he have addictions that control him?

359
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,640
 Does he have a lot of things that control and rule his life?

360
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,720
 What does he do over and over?

361
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,600
 What are the patterns in his life,

362
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,120
 negative or positive, say about who he is?

363
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,000
 What are his expectations?

364
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,800
 Talk about what he expects in a relationship.

365
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 Is he working towards the expectation

366
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,480
 that is the destination of marriage?

367
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,160
 Or does he just wanna play games?

368
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,520
 If he can't stand the heat, he needs to get out of the kitchen.

369
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,200
 Ask him his expectations.

370
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
 What are his affections towards?

371
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
 What does he care about?

372
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,360
 What is important to him?

373
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,520
 Like what does he talk about?

374
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,640
 What does he spend his like hours on hours doing?

375
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,400
 Is it work?

376
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,720
 Video games?

377
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,760
 Sports?

378
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,000
 Women, lots of women.

379
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,560
 Like what are his affections?

380
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,800
 Next, his reputation.

381
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,880
 What do those around him

382
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,960
 and in close proximity around him say about him?

383
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,360
 What is the reputation that precedes him?

384
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,000
 Is it like, man, that guy,

385
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,320
 like he can throw some back on the weekends.

386
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
 Like, or that guy, he's been with like every girl.

387
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,400
 Or like, oh, Mark, everyone knows Mark.

388
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,080
 Like what's his reputation?

389
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,760
 Is it someone that has the aroma of Christ?

390
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,520
 Is it someone that is known for being led by Christ?

391
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
 And then lastly, his time.

392
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,440
 What does how he spends his time

393
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,080
 say about what he cares about?

394
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,640
 Does he spend his time following Jesus,

395
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,120
 reading his Bible, praying, in church, serving,

396
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,840
 giving back, pouring in relationally,

397
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,520
 diving deep with people?

398
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,160
 What does his time say about what he cares about?

399
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,280
 Because we spend time doing the things we care about.

400
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,880
 So when you examine his heart,

401
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,760
 his heart will tell you what leads him.

402
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,720
 It's like, when we talk about this idea

403
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
 of like making sure you know what's leading them.

404
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,400
 Have y'all ever followed someone

405
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,640
 who has no idea where they're going in a car?

406
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,000
 Like, it's the most frustrating thing.

407
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And sometimes you notice when it's like too late.

408
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,160
 That happened to us today, actually,

409
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,560
 with some girls on our staff.

410
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,780
 We, just driving.

411
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,000
 And next thing you know, you're taking an exit

412
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,680
 and you're like, I thought that was okay,

413
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,280
 but then you're going and then you call

414
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,920
 and you're like, are you looking at maps?

415
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,360
 You know where you're going.

416
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,160
 Like, how are you getting, where are we going?

417
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,000
 And they're like, oh my gosh, I took the wrong exit.

418
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,400
 And you're like, why didn't you just look at the maps?

419
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,320
 Why didn't you wanna type in the address?

420
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,120
 You know, and it's just, okay,

421
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,240
 I'm following someone who has no idea where they're going.

422
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,440
 Like there's nothing leading them.

423
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,140
 And the destination, nowhere.

424
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,560
 The same with men who are not being led by Christ.

425
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,600
 If he's not being led by Jesus,

426
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,940
 your destination will probably end at a dead end,

427
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,940
 or you'll be lost, searching and frustrated.

428
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,800
 So make sure that you know that you know

429
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,520
 that he's being led by Jesus.

430
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,440
 And if he isn't following Jesus

431
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,600
 and he is not letting Jesus take hold of his life

432
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,680
 and shape everything about him, do not let him lead you.

433
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,480
 He is not dateable if he is not being led by Jesus.

434
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,340
 The next question, question number two,

435
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,700
 is he faithful or flaky?

436
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,460
 And I wanna have some fun with this one.

437
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,540
 Is he faithful or flaky?

438
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,940
 Because I think millennials,

439
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,700
 we kind of have this like rap for being flaky people.

440
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,980
 We're scared of commitment.

441
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,220
 We're scared of being tied down.

442
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,860
 We're like single till 30 at least.

443
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,380
 We just like, if I wanna show up to the party, I will.

444
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,420
 I know I said I'd be there, like,

445
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,940
 but this bubble bath is feeling good.

446
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,900
 Got a glass of wine.

447
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,900
 Like, we can be flaky people and that's all fun.

448
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,980
 And we laugh at it until we encounter it

449
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,900
 with someone that we like.

450
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,860
 And their flakiness is what defines them.

451
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,900
 And we're impacted by that inability to commit,

452
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,980
 the inability to be faithful as a man.

453
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,980
 And I hear so many girls say,

454
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,540
 man, like, where are the godly men?

455
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,980
 Where are the godly men at?

456
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,500
 And yet all they hang out with is boys.

457
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,640
 All they do.

458
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,900
 (laughing)

459
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,660
 Okay, okay.

460
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,360
 But I'm just saying where you spend your time,

461
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,020
 who you spend your time with,

462
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,140
 that's the result you're gonna get.

463
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,100
 And so don't claim with your mouth to want a man

464
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,140
 and all you do is hang out with boys.

465
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,140
 Be where the men are.

466
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,340
 And just 'cause we're at the porch

467
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,940
 doesn't mean everyone here's a man, okay?

468
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,820
 Let me just say that.

469
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,620
 Y'all already know that though.

470
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,540
 Okay, but,

471
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:43,220
 got me off track.

472
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,500
 And the idea of being faithful or flaky,

473
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,220
 ask these questions, like, is he passive?

474
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,620
 Is he committed?

475
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,140
 Does he do what he say he's gonna do?

476
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,700
 Does he show up when he says he'll show up?

477
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,340
 Does he follow through with his commitments?

478
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,780
 Does he communicate?

479
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,660
 Is he Snapchatting other women?

480
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,380
 Ask these questions.

481
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,860
 And ask yourself, is this guy faithful or flaky?

482
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,820
 James 5, 12 puts it this way.

483
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,980
 By, but above all, my brothers,

484
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,140
 do not swear either by heaven or by earth

485
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,700
 or by any other oath,

486
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,100
 but let your yes be yes and your no be no,

487
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,140
 so that you may not fall under condemnation.

488
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,660
 Boys are flaky.

489
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,300
 Men are faithful.

490
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,100
 Men do what they said they're gonna do.

491
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,300
 Men follow through.

492
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,340
 Paul gives us this charge as men in 1 Corinthians 16,

493
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,580
 13 through 14, he says, "Men, be watchful.

494
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,900
 "Stand firm in the faith.

495
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,180
 "Act like men.

496
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,700
 "Be strong.

497
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,100
 "Let all that you do be done in love."

498
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,740
 When you are messing with a girl's emotions

499
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,020
 by being flaky,

500
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,180
 that is not the attitude and the attributes of a man.

501
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,980
 That's like boy vibes.

502
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,780
 You wanna be a man.

503
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,580
 You wanna be who you say you are.

504
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,180
 And I wanna address something

505
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,300
 that we get asked about a lot here.

506
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,220
 And if you follow JP, former director,

507
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,180
 they, I mean, girls ask this every Friday Q&A

508
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,500
 he has without fail.

509
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,980
 And I'm like, I'm about to give the answer.

510
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
 I'm about to say it loud and proud.

511
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,380
 Once and for all, you never have to ask again.

512
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,460
 Everyone asks this idea about ghosting.

513
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,420
 And they say, "JP or Porch,

514
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,380
 "if he ghosts me, should I keep trying?

515
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,580
 "Should I keep like pursuing?

516
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,540
 "Should I stick around?

517
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,740
 "Because like what he does, it's like,

518
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,300
 "he dangles a tree and I'm like, oh, this is nice.

519
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
 "And then like, boom, vanishes.

520
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,220
 "And then like, right when I'm like, I'm done with him,

521
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,540
 "he comes back and I'm like, oh, this is nice.

522
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,140
 "And then go back and forth.

523
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,020
 "Like if he ghosts me, should I leave?"

524
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,380
 Here's the answer.

525
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,260
 I'm serious, ladies, repeat after me.

526
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,220
 Ready?

527
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,380
 If he ghosts me, he needs the Holy Ghost.

528
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,220
 Ready?

529
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,380
 If he ghosts me, he needs the Holy Ghost.

530
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,420
 Okay, he needs the Holy Ghost and you need to say bye.

531
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,220
 Because men of God aren't flaky.

532
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,540
 They're not ghosting.

533
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,700
 They are intentional.

534
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
 And I'm not saying this doesn't mean

535
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,620
 that he's not a Christian.

536
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,140
 I'm saying that he is not mature enough

537
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,540
 to be leading you as a man.

538
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,860
 Because men act like men.

539
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,220
 Men are strong.

540
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,300
 Men are followed by their faith,

541
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,540
 not their feelings or emotions.

542
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,540
 Men pursue with love and clarity and kindness.

543
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,100
 Guys, I'm about to like bring my attention to you

544
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,020
 for just a second.

545
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,780
 Like again, if you do these things I'm about to say,

546
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,340
 okay, do this.

547
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,820
 I don't know why God made women this way,

548
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,620
 but it is in every woman's DNA to overthink.

549
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,380
 They are constantly wondering about everything.

550
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,220
 It's a beautiful part of who you are, embrace it.

551
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,500
 Like they're constantly overthinking.

552
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,220
 And so your job as a man is to take her 1,000 thoughts

553
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,060
 and conduce them to one, bring them down to one thought.

554
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,940
 That's what you do.

555
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,340
 And how you do that is through something

556
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,980
 called communication, okay?

557
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,420
 (congregation cheering)

558
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,860
 Listen, here's how you communicate to a woman.

559
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,140
 Ladies, if he does this, he's probably dateable.

560
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,180
 First, you approach them with clarity.

561
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,300
 You're clear on what you're about to say.

562
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,700
 Next, you handle it with care.

563
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,020
 And then lastly, you say it with conviction.

564
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,260
 You mean what you say and say what you mean.

565
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,980
 And you know why you're saying what you're saying, okay?

566
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,340
 Clarity, care, conviction.

567
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,300
 If you do that, she'll respond with the three R's.

568
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,900
 She'll see what you have to say,

569
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,380
 reflect on it, and respond accordingly, okay?

570
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,340
 So you wanna practice the three C's,

571
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,860
 and how you practice the three C's

572
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,820
 will say everything about her three R's.

573
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,140
 How you communicate will determine her response.

574
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,420
 Why? Because you're the leader.

575
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,060
 And you want her to feel confident and clear

576
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,660
 and understanding, hey, this is who he is.

577
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,220
 This is his plan for us.

578
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,460
 This is what we're doing.

579
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,260
 He is faithful, not flaky.

580
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,340
 There was a time in our relationship, me and Jenna,

581
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,020
 where I was planning the most epic proposal

582
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,700
 of all times behind the scenes.

583
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,060
 And it's like really hard to be like communicating often

584
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,260
 when you're like lying a lot and like hiding

585
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,540
 and hiding things behind the scenes.

586
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,100
 And like, I'm like being distant

587
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,180
 because she's like, what you doing?

588
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,860
 And I'm like blowing up balloons.

589
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,780
 And I'm like, oh, nothing.

590
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,260
 And so I was kind of distancing myself, I'll admit it.

591
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,100
 And as I'm planning to propose

592
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,340
 and commit my life to this woman,

593
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,340
 she has the audacity to say one day, do you like me?

594
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,180
 And I'm like, what do you mean, do I like you?

595
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,140
 And she's like, I don't know.

596
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,020
 I just feel like lately it's been different.

597
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,820
 Like, do you like me?

598
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,020
 And that moment I could have chose to be like, what?

599
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,700
 I'm over here dropping money.

600
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,180
 I'm over here planning.

601
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,540
 I'm over here doing everything

602
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,940
 to just demonstrate my love for you.

603
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,180
 But I thought about it and I'm like, okay,

604
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,460
 in the pursuit to do this,

605
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,460
 I have kind of let down my leadership

606
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,780
 and I've like let my guard down a little.

607
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,100
 And so I looked at her, fellows,

608
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,700
 and I practiced the three C's.

609
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,660
 I looked at her and I said with clarity,

610
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,180
 hey, I really like you.

611
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,500
 And I said it with care and with conviction.

612
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,980
 I said, girl, it's you and only you.

613
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,180
 My eyes are only on you.

614
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,220
 No one else, I'm not going anywhere else.

615
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,860
 Just you wait and see.

616
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,420
 And she took that, she received it,

617
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,260
 she reflected, she's like,

618
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,620
 "Finn, maybe you were overthinking a little."

619
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,540
 And like, maybe, you know, he really,

620
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,820
 like that phone call the other night

621
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,780
 was actually really good.

622
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,900
 And then she responds accordingly

623
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,260
 because that's what happens when men are faithful.

624
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,580
 That's what happens when men lead.

625
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,660
 Women are waiting for men to step up and lead.

626
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,820
 And guys, I get it wrong all the time.

627
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,620
 Do not hear me say like, hey, be like me.

628
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,660
 I'm not saying that.

629
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,740
 What I'm saying is, is be like Christ.

630
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,580
 Be like Jesus.

631
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,620
 Whatever that looks like for you

632
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,580
 in your context of your relationship, be it.

633
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,820
 Be God's men, act strong, be like men.

634
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:23,300
 But ladies, I think, while I was prepping,

635
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,060
 I was just thinking, I think a lot of times,

636
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,760
 like sadly, the reason why we keep coming back

637
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,760
 to these men who hurt us and ghost us and are flaky,

638
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,060
 could be for a few reasons.

639
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,340
 One, fear.

640
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,100
 You have a fear that you're gonna be forever alone.

641
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,620
 And so you begin to lower your standards and compromise.

642
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,580
 And you also have this fear and this thought telling you,

643
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,500
 well, like, what if there's not someone better than this?

644
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:59,820
 Another reason that you might tolerate

645
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,020
 a guy who's not dateable is excuses.

646
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,580
 You become an expert excuse maker,

647
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,660
 where you say, well, he just, it was just a mistake.

648
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,140
 He just messed up one time.

649
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,600
 Well, just two times.

650
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,840
 Well, just three times, just four times.

651
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,840
 And you've become an expert at making excuses for him,

652
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,020
 because you'd rather have a guy who, yeah,

653
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,620
 like he's not leading you well,

654
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,460
 but at least you're not alone.

655
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,400
 And again, fear is dictating your actions,

656
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,640
 which are excuses.

657
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,260
 And you deserve better than that.

658
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,080
 Or lastly, maybe it's your identity.

659
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,960
 There's something in your identity that does not believe

660
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,860
 that you deserve a man that I'm describing.

661
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,400
 That you don't deserve a man to wholeheartedly

662
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,260
 in a God honoring way, pursue you

663
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,400
 with clarity and love and gentleness.

664
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,860
 It's because like, there's something in you

665
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,860
 that thinks like, you know, this is all about me.

666
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,660
 It's all about who I am, like my identity.

667
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
 I deserve this.

668
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,100
 I deserve this.

669
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,040
 But the reason why you want a man to pursue you this way

670
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,900
 is not to do with anything regarding who you are,

671
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,840
 but whose you are.

672
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,980
 That because you are not you, but a daughter of him,

673
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,180
 that's why you wanna be pursued this way.

674
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,280
 Your identity is not founded in yourself,

675
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,460
 the bad or the good.

676
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,420
 What you don't deserve or what you think you deserve.

677
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,800
 Because your identity is founded in Jesus,

678
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,280
 that's why you deserve to be pursued and led

679
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,960
 by someone who has given their heart to Jesus.

680
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,060
 So I'd ask you tonight, when considering if he's dateable,

681
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,140
 first consider, hey, is fear making excuses

682
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,300
 because something's wrong with your identity,

683
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,500
 it's placed in something other than Jesus.

684
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:06,380
 Because flakiness isn't what marks a man that's dateable.

685
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,700
 Faithfulness does.

686
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,140
 So if he's not all in, if he is not committed

687
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,660
 and all in with you, get out.

688
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,980
 Question number three,

689
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,500
 is he committed to your purity over his pleasure?

690
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:29,540
 Ooh, is he committed to your purity over his pleasure?

691
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,500
 Because y'all, purity matters.

692
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,980
 God cares a lot about how we use our bodies.

693
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,280
 He cares a lot about how we act sexually.

694
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,800
 In a world that tells you that you can do what you want,

695
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,660
 when you want, that the idea of not having sex

696
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,100
 before dating or engaged or married,

697
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,320
 that it's just crazy to think,

698
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,740
 like you mean to tell me that y'all haven't tested

699
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,300
 your sexual chemistry?

700
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,380
 That is cultures lies that are feeding you

701
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,280
 and forming your decisions.

702
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,040
 That is not what God would have for you.

703
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,560
 In that, when you follow that ideology,

704
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,080
 that you have to be sexually compatible to be with someone,

705
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,180
 you are setting yourself up for a lifelong commitment

706
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,160
 to unmet expectations and hurt.

707
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,420
 'Cause that's not God's design.

708
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,280
 That's not what should attract you to someone.

709
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,580
 That's not what should make someone significant to you

710
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,360
 or worth dating to you.

711
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,920
 It has nothing to do with that.

712
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,280
 But God does have a lot to say about how we utilize pleasure,

713
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,960
 how we utilize sex.

714
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,280
 And so here's what a couple of verses, Hebrews 13, four,

715
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,280
 it says, "Let marriage be held in honor among all."

716
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,960
 When you make the decisions to honor God

717
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,920
 in your dating life, you are following this command

718
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,620
 because how you date prepares you for how you're married.

719
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,140
 So you're letting marriage be held in honor among all.

720
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,120
 And what does that look like?

721
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,120
 It says, "And let the marriage bed be undefiled,"

722
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,720
 AKA don't have sex before you're married.

723
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,720
 "For God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous."

724
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,720
 First Corinthians 6, 18 says this, "Run from sexual sin.

725
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,040
 No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does.

726
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,120
 For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body."

727
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,260
 Don't you realize, again, he brings it back to value.

728
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,040
 Not keeping something from you,

729
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,000
 informing you about what you're worth.

730
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,800
 Don't you realize that your body

731
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,660
 is the temple of the Holy Spirit,

732
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,560
 who lives in you and was given to you by God?

733
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,960
 You do not belong to yourself.

734
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,920
 You don't get to decide if you are a Christian.

735
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,000
 You are signing up to be Christ-like.

736
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,320
 Not what you want, what he wants, because you trust him,

737
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,000
 because you love him, because you surrender to him.

738
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,120
 And so you say right here, "Hey, I don't belong to myself."

739
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,520
 "For God has bought me with a high price,

740
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,400
 the price of his one and only son, Jesus.

741
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,720
 So I must honor God with my body."

742
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,640
 This shows me that God, if he puts this in the Bible,

743
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,240
 it means he cares a lot about it.

744
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,060
 He cares a lot about how we use our bodies

745
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,600
 and who we give our bodies to.

746
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,960
 Why?

747
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,360
 Genesis chapter two,

748
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,320
 we see the first institution of marriage.

749
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,600
 It says, "Therefore a man shall leave his father

750
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
 and his mother and hold fast to his wife

751
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,080
 or lay with his wife and they shall become one flesh."

752
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,080
 One flesh.

753
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,120
 We call those things soul ties, connection.

754
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,000
 And I know you think that when you get to a certain point

755
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,520
 of intimacy, it's now time for you to act physically.

756
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,320
 And that is the product that is sex.

757
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,480
 You have sex with someone to show them

758
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,720
 that you care about them.

759
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,240
 Or some of you think, no, you just have sex with someone

760
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,000
 because you're both just like wanting to find pleasure.

761
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,680
 But God is saying here, it's so much more than that.

762
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,000
 I designed this to be, to have so much pleasure

763
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,960
 on the other end, but I'm asking you to trust me

764
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,000
 with how you do it and when you do it

765
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,640
 and who you do it with.

766
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,480
 And he would say here that you do it with one person,

767
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,760
 your spouse, after you're married.

768
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,920
 Why?

769
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,600
 Have you ever thought that the reason why maybe

770
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,280
 you can't get over your ex

771
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,560
 or that person still holds such of like a weird place

772
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,440
 in the back of your mind and in your heart

773
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,280
 is because you both chose pleasure over purity

774
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,460
 and you gave yourself to them and y'all started to connect

775
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,720
 at a soul level because that's what God intended

776
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,240
 for sex to be, but you did it outside of marriage.

777
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,640
 Therefore you ended it and you broke up and you move on

778
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,600
 and yet you wonder why your heart hasn't moved on

779
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,720
 because you have gone outside God's bounds

780
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,840
 and you've given yourself to them on a deep, deep,

781
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,560
 intimate level and you can't find yourself

782
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,120
 being able to separate from it.

783
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,240
 That's why God cares.

784
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
 He's like, if you would just choose to trust me,

785
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,480
 you're gonna get the most pleasure ever, but do it my way.

786
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,640
 I am the inventor.

787
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:20,520
 I know everything about you, your makeup, your wiring.

788
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,300
 I know everything and I ask you to trust me with this.

789
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,600
 But I think it's really hard for us to believe

790
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,040
 that it's worth the wait,

791
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,560
 that it's worth choosing to operate

792
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,920
 from a place of purity, not pleasure.

793
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,920
 It's like this, I think a lot of times we as men,

794
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,760
 we like, let's say sex is a fire, like sex is fire, okay?

795
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,480
 Is that, who sung that?

796
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,600
 ♪ Sex is on fire ♪

797
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,440
 I know that song.

798
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,040
 It's like, let's imagine sex is fire.

799
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,160
 And I think we are naturally wired as men to treat it.

800
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,160
 I don't wanna speak for women, maybe women too, honestly,

801
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,920
 to treat it like this though.

802
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,600
 Everyone knows what this does to fire, especially men.

803
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
 Just like we like sex,

804
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,840
 we like lighter fluid for whatever reason.

805
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,640
 And so we go, we put something down,

806
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,520
 we light a match and we're like,

807
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,200
 and we watch it like, and it's like awesome.

808
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,320
 It does something to us as a man.

809
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,840
 It brings us pleasure.

810
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,160
 It's weird, I know.

811
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,840
 But the problem with this is,

812
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,520
 is this never creates a fire that lasts, ever.

813
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,280
 Yeah, it creates a huge spark.

814
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,480
 It creates a show.

815
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,120
 It makes me feel alive for a moment,

816
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,840
 but that fire will never last.

817
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,560
 And you claim to want a love that lasts,

818
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,640
 yet you're operating with this.

819
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,320
 And you're coming and you're like, oh, fire.

820
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,960
 And it blows up and that's sex.

821
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,360
 You're like, oh, a problem, let's have sex.

822
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,360
 And sex becomes your solution to your problems.

823
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,320
 Or, oh, we haven't felt really connected.

824
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,240
 And so let's have sex.

825
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,320
 And oh, we're back together.

826
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,280
 Oh, we're cuddling again.

827
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,080
 Oh, we're intimate again.

828
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,000
 And there's this cycle because sadly,

829
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,920
 I think now women have found pleasure

830
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,240
 in giving their man pleasure.

831
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,000
 Why? Because that's the time that he gives you attention.

832
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,680
 And so what happens is this like vicious cycle begins

833
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,000
 where if you want attention and you feel empty,

834
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,520
 you know if you give him pleasure,

835
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,680
 that equates to attention.

836
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,400
 And so now he's giving you attention,

837
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,920
 you give him pleasure, he then gives you attention,

838
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,480
 and you're just feeding each other and just going.

839
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,160
 But eventually this is gonna run out.

840
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,600
 And this won't be enough.

841
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,680
 And you're not warm.

842
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,080
 You don't feel safe.

843
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,120
 It's just a quick fix.

844
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,160
 And it's become your source.

845
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,640
 But that source runs out.

846
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,400
 And so you get rid of the bottle

847
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,080
 and you have to go get a new one.

848
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,600
 But what God intended was that your dating life

849
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,920
 is heading towards experiencing sex

850
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,160
 in an amazing way in marriage.

851
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,280
 Like God is so pro-sex.

852
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,000
 He invented it.

853
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,920
 But what he asked us to do is to take time

854
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,080
 building the fire in our dating relationship,

855
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,400
 spending time pursuing purity, not pleasure,

856
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,640
 spending time being focused on what she needs

857
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,400
 to care for her soul and to not hurt her and to damage her.

858
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,120
 And when you spend time building this fire

859
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,640
 and preparing this fire,

860
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,600
 when marriage comes, you get to set it ablaze.

861
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,800
 And I know that we're all thinking,

862
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
 man, it's gonna be amazing.

863
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,480
 Like those that are waiting, I'm so proud of you.

864
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,640
 Keep waiting, keep going, keep pursuing purity.

865
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,720
 But the reality is, is if you choose

866
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,560
 to spend your dating life honoring her

867
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,360
 by being committed to her purity over your pleasure,

868
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,760
 you're gonna create a fire that is warm,

869
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,760
 inviting, and that lasts.

870
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,360
 You're creating a space for a love that will last

871
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,880
 because you chose to date with the right priorities.

872
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,360
 And you can keep adding and adding and adding.

873
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,440
 And I'm not gonna act like the struggle ain't real.

874
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,560
 Like I'm in it right now.

875
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,400
 Like I see marriage on the horizon,

876
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,320
 but the struggle is real today.

877
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,080
 I know that.

878
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,920
 But you know what's more of a real struggle?

879
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,760
 Is when you cross those boundaries

880
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,060
 and create those soul ties and then leave her.

881
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,280
 And she feels used.

882
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,320
 That's a worse struggle.

883
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,620
 And so make the commitment today, men,

884
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,420
 to honor her purity over your own pleasure.

885
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,800
 Women, wait for someone who's gonna see you

886
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,620
 as someone that he wants to protect and provide for,

887
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,120
 not to only get pleasure from.

888
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,900
 Psalm 119 says, "How can a young person stay pure?

889
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,020
 "By obeying your word,

890
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,320
 "by listening to everything I've read and saying,

891
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,200
 "God, I know what I feel, I know what I want,

892
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,020
 "but I'm gonna trust you.

893
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,420
 "I'm gonna lead her by following you.

894
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,440
 "I'm gonna choose to be a faithful man of God

895
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,740
 "and not a flaky boy.

896
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:19,420
 "And I'm gonna choose her purity over my pleasure

897
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,980
 "because your word tells me to,

898
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,820
 "because I trust in your design."

899
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,820
 And ladies, if he trusts in God's design, he is dateable.

900
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,480
 Because he sees your value as a daughter of God.

901
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,580
 So I wanna close with this.

902
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:47,100
 I start off by saying that the one thing

903
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,820
 I want everyone to walk away with tonight

904
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,260
 is understanding their value.

905
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,780
 In that verse, it talks about,

906
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,760
 "Hey, don't you understand that you have been bought

907
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,300
 "with a high price?"

908
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,820
 Paul is talking there about how God sent his son, Jesus,

909
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,260
 to die for our sins.

910
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,060
 And I know that in talking about sexual past

911
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,900
 and all these different things,

912
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,060
 like some people can feel like,

913
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,620
 "Hey, I'm not worthy of this kind of relationship."

914
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,440
 Or some of you can feel like,

915
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,460
 "Hey, I could never be that kind of person

916
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,100
 "if only you've known what I've done,

917
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,500
 "if you've known the relationships I've been in,

918
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,360
 "if you knew these things."

919
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,140
 And I'm telling you that the blood of Jesus

920
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,880
 covers every sin you've committed.

921
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
 That no matter your sexual past,

922
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,620
 no matter if you've given yourself away,

923
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,700
 no matter if those boundaries have been crossed

924
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,220
 because of Jesus and his death, burial, and resurrection,

925
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,560
 you are new.

926
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,060
 That's the beauty of why we gather.

927
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,300
 That's the beauty of why we're here,

928
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,540
 is I'm here tonight to tell you

929
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,260
 that this doesn't have to be your story.

930
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,460
 That because of Jesus, you can be new.

931
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,560
 That no matter how you've been dating,

932
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,460
 no matter how you view relationships,

933
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,220
 no matter how you viewed women or women,

934
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,820
 you viewed men or yourself, you can be new tonight.

935
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,520
 Because it's never been about you.

936
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,700
 It's been about what Jesus has done for you.

937
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,340
 And because of what he's done for you,

938
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,140
 he now calls you son and daughter.

939
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:16,020
 And so I pray that every single one of you would act like it.

940
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,100
 Like you would live, like you were bought with a price,

941
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,740
 that you are of value, of the God of all creation,

942
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,900
 the King of kings and the Lord of lords.

943
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,860
 Because the more you see your value,

944
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,580
 the more you see your worth,

945
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:36,380
 the more you will live in your calling and your purpose.

946
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,080
 And for the girl here tonight,

947
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,080
 who has been hurt by men who are acting like boys,

948
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,660
 who have claimed one thing and been another,

949
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,340
 I wanna say on behalf of men, I'm sorry.

950
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,620
 And Jesus can heal you and make you new.

951
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,440
 And you are worth being pursued by a man

952
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,540
 who is dateable, who loves God.

953
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,020
 For my men, for my brothers.

954
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,220
 If you've been one of the guys that I'm talking about,

955
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:13,740
 a guy who has not been leading women well,

956
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,980
 I know that behind every one of your poor dating decisions

957
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,360
 and choices and ways is not a dating problem.

958
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,440
 It's a deeper problem.

959
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,160
 Maybe dating was never modeled for you.

960
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,440
 Maybe divorce was a part of your story

961
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,200
 and you saw what was supposed to be a committed relationship

962
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,140
 fall apart and had effects on you.

963
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,040
 Maybe the people around you have told you

964
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,340
 to date a certain way and you've done another.

965
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,520
 Or maybe you have at one point connected emotionally

966
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,360
 with a woman and she broke up with you,

967
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,660
 cheated on you, rejected you.

968
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,500
 And you never wanna feel that rejection and hurt again.

969
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,700
 And so you have chosen to stiff arm women

970
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,600
 and to keep yourself emotionally unattached from them,

971
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,420
 resulting in hurting them, but pleasing yourself.

972
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,480
 And you've never been the same

973
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,640
 because you've never healed from that hurt.

974
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,700
 That can change for you tonight.

975
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,380
 Every single one of you tonight has the opportunity

976
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,380
 to be healed by Jesus, to be made new by Jesus.

977
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:30,000
 And if you would be marked by Jesus, you will be dateable.

978
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,280
 He will be dateable.

979
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,120
 Let's pray.

980
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:40,440
 Father, I ask in your name that you would come

981
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,440
 and show us where we are

982
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,440
 not being who you called us to be.

983
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:57,740
 Would you help women tonight make the courageous step

984
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,540
 of saying no more?

985
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,140
 I'm seeing my value, I'm seeing my worth,

986
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,020
 and I'm changing how I live.

987
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,980
 I'm changing who I follow,

988
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,100
 and I'm changing who leads me from this day forward.

989
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,500
 Men, God, I pray for the men tonight

990
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,500
 that they would see their calling and their purpose

991
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:30,360
 and the opportunity they have as a man to step up.

992
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,960
 And that when they step up,

993
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,400
 they're not forsaking something,

994
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,880
 they're stepping into something so fruitful

995
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,640
 and something so adventurous

996
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,520
 and something so much better than continual hurt

997
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,520
 and pain and longing.

998
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,660
 May that story end for them tonight.

999
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:52,280
 I pray that you would raise up godly marriages

1000
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,380
 in Dallas, Texas, that this would be the ministry

1001
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,000
 that is marked by people who say,

1002
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,300
 we're gonna be different.

1003
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:05,340
 We're gonna be led by Jesus, not culture.

1004
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,480
 We're gonna pursue purity and not pleasure.

1005
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,660
 We're gonna be faithful men and women of God.

1006
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:20,640
 And God, would you be honored by that?

1007
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,300
 Thank you that it's not up to us

1008
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,220
 to be the perfect boyfriend or girlfriend

1009
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,300
 or husband or wife, but because of you,

1010
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:37,060
 we can be made new and live like you called us to live.

1011
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,220
 If there's someone here tonight

1012
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,340
 who's never entered into that relationship,

1013
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,340
 I pray that they would stop the search for a guy or girl

1014
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,860
 and start the search for an abiding,

1015
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,300
 intimate relationship with you,

1016
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,940
 because there is nothing sweeter, nothing greater.

1017
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,420
 You know the needs of this room right now,

1018
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,380
 but you come and do what you do.

1019
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,500
 And then I pray, amen.
