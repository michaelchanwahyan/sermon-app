00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,200

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,180
 - Love it.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,300
 I'm gonna continue reading through 1 Peter,

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,540
 and then I'll pray, and then we'll dive in.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,140
 Picking it up in chapter two, verse one.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,060
 Peter says this.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,340
 Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,460
 and of all deceit, hypocrisy, envy,

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,740
 and slander of every kind.

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,500
 Like newborn babies, crave the pure spiritual milk

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,780
 so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,260
 now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,860
 As you come to him, the living stone, that's Christ,

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,060
 rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him,

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,600
 you also, like living stones,

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,900
 are being built into a spiritual house

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,000
 to be a royal or holy priesthood,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,700
 offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,240
 through Jesus Christ.

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,980
 For in scripture it says,

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,820
 see, I lay in a stone in Zion,

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,060
 a chosen and precious cornerstone,

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,220
 and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.

29
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,920
 Now to you who believe this stone, Jesus, is precious,

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,220
 but to those who do not believe,

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,620
 the stone the builders rejected

32
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,060
 has become the cornerstone,

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,160
 a stone that causes people to stumble

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,320
 and a rock that makes them fall.

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,560
 They stumble because they disobey the message,

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,480
 which is also what they were destined for.

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,920
 But you are a chosen people,

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
 a royal priesthood, a holy nation,

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,720
 God's special possession,

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,600
 that you may proclaim or declare the praises of him

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,880
 who called you out of darkness

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,040
 and into his marvelous light.

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,080
 Once you were not a people,

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,880
 but now you have become the people of God.

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,740
 Once you had not received mercy,

46
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,180
 but now you have received mercy.

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,020
 Let me pray.

48
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,780
 Father, we thank you just for the words of Peter.

49
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,700
 Would you use them tonight to strengthen our hearts,

50
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,500
 to make us fall more in love with the cornerstone,

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,740
 with our savior, with Jesus,

52
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,200
 to make us look more like Jesus,

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,040
 to make us see more of Jesus.

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,860
 Pray for anyone in this room

55
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,660
 who doesn't have a relationship with you, Lord,

56
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,260
 or that maybe just feels overwhelmed

57
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,460
 by the circumstances in their life,

58
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,580
 would you win tonight?

59
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,400
 Would you win?

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
 Amen.

61
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,920
 Well, hello, friends in the room

62
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,880
 and friends in Fort Worth and Houston

63
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,120
 and Spring and the Woodlands and El Paso and everywhere.

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,040
 Tune around, Tulsa joining us tonight.

65
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,480
 I'm gonna start, continue the series

66
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,380
 with a little bit of a story.

67
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,360
 When I was, about eight years ago,

68
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,680
 I got a phone call from Watermark that said,

69
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,400
 "Hey, if you come up here and jump on our staff part-time,

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,460
 "we will pay you something very small

71
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,760
 "and we will provide housing for you."

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,440
 So it'll like enrich.

73
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,620
 Though we can't pay you a ton,

74
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,300
 we'll provide free housing for you.

75
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,420
 And so they said it would be in the back house

76
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,740
 of this family.

77
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,020
 So I, through long series, ended up being like,

78
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,340
 "Yeah, I'm gonna come and I'm gonna do it."

79
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,720
 And came on staff here and didn't know the house

80
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,780
 that I was gonna be set up in.

81
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,020
 I was gonna live in this back house

82
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,700
 and they gave me the address and I went to it

83
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,160
 and had no idea what to expect.

84
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,060
 I packed up my stuff in College Station, Texas,

85
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,700
 headed up from, yeah, thank you, there we go.

86
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,980
 Headed up from Texas A&M, the greatest university on earth,

87
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,980
 and went to, (laughs)

88
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,200
 man, I does it every time.

89
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,680
 And I went and I headed towards this house.

90
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,720
 So I'm going, not sure what to expect.

91
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,680
 I finally, I pull up to this house

92
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
 and little did I know that the street

93
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,400
 that I was pulling up to this house was on,

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,760
 I would find out, was a street that's known in Dallas

95
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,120
 called Billionaire's Row.

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,320
 And so it was like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Unleashed.

97
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,080
 It was like, man, I pulled up to the house,

98
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,400
 seven or eight, man, there's Uncle Phil, Carlton's here.

99
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,200
 This is unbelievable.

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,260
 I'm like, I cannot believe this is where I'm about to live

101
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,100
 for the next year.

102
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,600
 This is the nicest living I will ever have

103
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,120
 for the rest of my life.

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
 Can you guys adopt me?

105
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
 Will you be my dad?

106
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,800
 And it was like unreal, this house.

107
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,560
 And so literally, if I was to go through

108
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,920
 some of the billionaires or just the people that lived,

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,680
 the neighbors, the politicians, the sports stars,

110
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,560
 they were names recognized that were just kind of

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
 the neighbors that lived on this street next to us.

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
 And I say that 'cause I got to know the family

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,960
 and spend time with them and it was just

114
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,680
 this amazing experience for a year.

115
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,840
 And at some point, I began to be friends

116
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,080
 with one of the sons or the son in this family

117
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,040
 and we were talking about the homes that were around

118
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,440
 and talking about the neighbors that were there

119
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,020
 and he goes, dude, that's nothing.

120
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,200
 There's a house two doors down.

121
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,640
 It makes the rest of the houses around here

122
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,400
 look like little child's play,

123
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
 little gingerbread houses or something.

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
 I mean, this house, the average house around this street

125
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,120
 in this area is 10,000 square feet, which is big.

126
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,740
 This house is 70,000 square feet.

127
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,640
 And he's like, hey, I got to take you over

128
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,520
 so you can see kind of the plot of land

129
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,120
 'cause you could go behind the back

130
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,240
 and which will make sense why.

131
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,120
 You could go behind the backyards, two houses down.

132
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
 He's like, you got to come see it.

133
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,860
 But here's what else.

134
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,120
 So it was 70,000 square feet.

135
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,440
 I mean, this house is like unreal.

136
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,640
 This is on Cribs or something

137
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,240
 if they still have the Cribs show.

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,040
 16 car garage with its own indoor car wash.

139
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,480
 A 21 person movie theater.

140
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,840
 The master suite, man, this is so crazy.

141
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,280
 Master suite was 3,000 square feet.

142
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,600
 That is twice as big as my house.

143
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,160
 And that's just the bedroom that these people are living in.

144
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,620
 They had a two-story suite and wing for the kids

145
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,240
 that had its own jacuzzis.

146
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,860
 It had all this huge setup.

147
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,600
 They had these inside of their bathrooms,

148
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,840
 two of these huge Carrara marble from Italy,

149
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,940
 Verona flown in to be there.

150
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,940
 The staircase, $300,000 for the stairs, people.

151
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,740
 (laughs)

152
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,720
 Man, that's crazy.

153
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,320
 Anyways, so he's going through

154
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
 and he's telling me all about it.

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,240
 And there was a wine room that had 20,000 bottles of wine

156
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,200
 that could fit inside of it.

157
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,300
 There was a gift wrapping room.

158
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,600
 Who has a gift wrapping room?

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
 I guess if you got a house that big.

160
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,900
 It was the second biggest home in America.

161
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,640
 There was another home on the property

162
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,760
 that's 10 acres, 2,600 square feet

163
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,520
 that the guards lived in.

164
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,920
 Man, and they were living well inside of it.

165
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,280
 It had its own full 6,000 square foot indoor pool

166
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,300
 and indoor volleyball pool for people to play volleyball

167
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,580
 inside of the pool and a huge lap pool in there.

168
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,340
 Like it was just this crazy home.

169
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,640
 And he's telling me all about everything

170
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,420
 that's a part of this home.

171
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,420
 And he takes me over there and I see the acreage

172
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,920
 and there's nothing.

173
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,960
 Like it's like, it was a bunch of rubble.

174
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,040
 And he explains three weeks before,

175
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,240
 this house it took eight years to build.

176
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,320
 Three weeks before they were supposed to move in there.

177
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,360
 They were finishing touches.

178
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,480
 They were staining the final parts of the floor.

179
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,900
 And you can look it up.

180
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,300
 Three weeks before the stain combusted

181
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,620
 and basically the windows acted like a magnifying glass

182
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,040
 and it all went up in flames.

183
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,340
 All of it, $44 million worth of it.

184
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,580
 It was the single largest loss of a home in Dallas history.

185
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,040
 It was at the time the most expensive home

186
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,960
 that Dallas has ever, that's ever been built.

187
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,540
 And this home that was like incredible.

188
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,820
 I mean, all the different finishing touches by this family,

189
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,760
 they had put and here's how it's gonna be designed

190
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,900
 and everything so that we can live there.

191
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,880
 This house would never fulfill its purpose.

192
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,720
 What's its purpose?

193
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,040
 For people to live in it.

194
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,060
 Not just have it be talked about and have it be worked on,

195
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,780
 but people to live in it.

196
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,260
 That's the purpose of a home.

197
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,260
 And three weeks right before everything would be,

198
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,540
 or everyone would be moved in there,

199
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,940
 it all went up in flames.

200
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,980
 It never fulfilled its purpose.

201
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,840
 And I start there because tonight as we explore first Peter,

202
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,980
 what Peter's gonna tell us is that there is a purpose

203
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,260
 that now that we have become Christians,

204
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,020
 or if you become a Christ follower,

205
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,100
 there is certain and specific purposes

206
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,340
 that God has given his church or the body of Christ

207
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,740
 to experience to fulfill,

208
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,460
 that there's a purpose and design for you and I's life.

209
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,380
 And as young adults, there are thousands

210
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,820
 that are gathered here and all over the state of Texas

211
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,860
 and even scattered throughout

212
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,180
 that are listening with us tonight.

213
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,820
 We're in this stage of life where many of us,

214
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,060
 just like that home was on the verge

215
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,320
 of fulfilling its purpose.

216
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,120
 It was on the verge of like people being in there

217
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,640
 and people living there and it never made it.

218
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,960
 We are on the verge of this unique time in life

219
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
 where you have more money, you have more access,

220
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,120
 you have more free time than you're gonna have

221
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,920
 in later circumstances by money.

222
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,360
 I just mean disposable income.

223
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,880
 I don't get to spend money on just whatever.

224
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,840
 I spend it on diapers.

225
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
 That's what I spend it on.

226
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,240
 You have this like disposable income,

227
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
 you have more disposable time.

228
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,000
 You can choose what to do.

229
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,560
 You have this freedom that is unique

230
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
 to this season of life.

231
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,080
 You're on the verge and in so many ways

232
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,440
 at the edge of experiencing your purpose,

233
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,740
 but yet so few young adults ever do.

234
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,740
 And honestly, so few Christians,

235
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,820
 tragically, even more tragic than a $44 million home,

236
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,100
 never experiencing its purpose.

237
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,320
 How much more tragic is it for a Christian

238
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,420
 to never step and cross over the boundary of its purpose,

239
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,900
 the purpose for which he or she was created?

240
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,720
 So tonight, Peter's gonna tell us

241
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,060
 what components of that are.

242
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,860
 If you and I are ever gonna experience the purpose

243
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,660
 for which you as a Christ follower,

244
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,460
 the salvation or the purpose for which you've been saved,

245
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,260
 he's gonna tell us what that looks like.

246
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,100
 And really, even if you're not a Christ follower,

247
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,940
 you're new to this thing,

248
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,980
 it's really he's gonna give us the purpose for all of life,

249
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,420
 regardless of where you're at in this stage.

250
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,300
 So we're gonna pick it up in verse one of chapter two

251
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,700
 as we continue this series.

252
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,420
 Chapter one, if you missed it the last couple weeks,

253
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,260
 go check it out.

254
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,080
 It's all in the app,

255
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,300
 but we just explored the first couple weeks

256
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,780
 where Peter in chapter one hits on these themes

257
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,700
 of being born again.

258
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,020
 Like, hey, you've been born, you've been given this new life

259
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,620
 God has done something, he's changed you,

260
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,940
 now you're to walk by faith,

261
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,500
 even in the midst of trials, that God has done something.

262
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,260
 And we stopped in verse 12,

263
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,220
 and really, Peter continues to talk about this new life,

264
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,500
 new birth that you've been given

265
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,740
 on the next few verses in chapter one.

266
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,780
 And in chapter two, he transitions,

267
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,580
 after talking about what you have in Christ,

268
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,460
 he begins to talk about what you do

269
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,120
 with what you have in Christ.

270
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,780
 We'll read it again in verse one.

271
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,340
 Here's what he says.

272
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,340
 Therefore, in light of this new birth,

273
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,460
 in light of this new life that God has given you,

274
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,160
 rid yourselves of all malice or like maliciousness,

275
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,080
 don't behave towards people in an ill will,

276
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,060
 like I hate this person, hatred could be interchanged there,

277
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,100
 of all deceit, don't deceive others,

278
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,220
 hypocrisy or being inauthentic or just faking it.

279
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,460
 Rid yourself of envy, of slander,

280
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,820
 of talking bad about people,

281
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,780
 of slander of every kind, and here's what you do.

282
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,660
 So you take that off, you put something on,

283
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,580
 like newborn babies crave pure spiritual milk,

284
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,940
 so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,

285
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,740
 now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.

286
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,340
 Like Peter says, hey, if you want to begin

287
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,520
 to experience your purpose in the Christian life,

288
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,480
 what do you do with what you have?

289
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,620
 You've got this new life, now that you have that new life,

290
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,740
 there's some certain things you're supposed

291
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,280
 to rid your life of, and now begin to consume yourself,

292
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,620
 or things that you're beginning to put into your life.

293
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,660
 You're to begin to consume the spiritual milk, he says,

294
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,380
 that just like milk makes a baby grow,

295
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,020
 you need to begin to consume the things

296
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,820
 that are gonna make your faith grow.

297
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,560
 Consume the things like God's word, you need to grow up,

298
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,500
 make the things that are gonna grow your faith

299
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,820
 and grow your relationship with Christ.

300
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,740
 Consume the things, disregard the things

301
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
 that are gonna hurt your faith,

302
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,060
 consume the things and consume your life

303
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,540
 with the things that are gonna grow your faith.

304
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,820
 Just like a child, this is how you grow up in maturity.

305
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,140
 You begin to fill your mind with God's word,

306
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,380
 you begin to fill your time with God's people in your life.

307
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,860
 He says, look, at the point you're at in life

308
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,500
 as newborn babes or as Christians,

309
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,580
 now that you have this new life,

310
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,380
 as he would say to all of us, you've got to grow up.

311
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,060
 God's purpose for you is not just that you sit there

312
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,460
 and that you're done and that, oh,

313
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,540
 you go to heaven when you die,

314
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,580
 that you would begin to experience your purpose,

315
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,300
 which starts with growing up in Christ.

316
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,660
 Our first idea from the text, Peter says right from it,

317
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,980
 is that you and I are to now grow up in Christ.

318
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,700
 How do we grow up in Christ, Peter?

319
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,540
 By, how do you grow, how does a child grow?

320
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,740
 They consume food, it all of a sudden builds them up.

321
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,620
 Peter says in the same way, he uses the illustration,

322
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,780
 that you and I are to consume the things that grow our faith

323
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,180
 and starve the things that hurt our faith,

324
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
 that we're to consume the things,

325
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,440
 specifically God's word around God's people.

326
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,780
 And he even gives the reason why, he's like,

327
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,700
 look, you've tasted how good it is to know God,

328
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,980
 how good it is to walk with God.

329
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,120
 If you became a Christian, I mean,

330
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,760
 you've tasted and experienced the goodness

331
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,100
 that comes from like freedom,

332
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,820
 or from freedom from sin and forgiveness,

333
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,940
 grace in your life, he's like,

334
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,420
 you've tasted how good God is,

335
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,340
 and it's given you a superior satisfaction.

336
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,860
 Now, continue to consume the things

337
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,680
 that are gonna grow your faith.

338
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,680
 Continue to study God's word, continue to grow up,

339
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,780
 he would say, to you and to me,

340
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,300
 and the key way that we do that,

341
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,380
 the key way that you grow as an individual

342
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,900
 is not by some self-help book,

343
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,700
 but by you studying God's word,

344
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,300
 living in community with God's people.

345
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,520
 He says that you've found this superior taste,

346
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,340
 and it has changed, or let it change

347
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,900
 the things in your past that don't taste as good anymore,

348
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,180
 because you tasted something better in Christ.

349
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,860
 It's not dissimilar to, when I grew up,

350
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,380
 and I'm gonna get judged for this,

351
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,460
 but I'm okay, 'cause hopefully it will illustrate.

352
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,080
 We ate from first grade in my house

353
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,760
 to fifth grade in my house, I had the same exact thing

354
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,960
 every single day for lunch, it was a one of two options,

355
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,260
 bologna and cheese and mayonnaise sandwiches,

356
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,420
 or option number two,

357
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,380
 bologna and cheese and ketchup sandwiches.

358
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,360
 That was the entire thing.

359
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,300
 If you came over to my house, this was just normal.

360
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,020
 I didn't realize this was weird,

361
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,780
 that bologna was not good for a long, long time.

362
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,020
 You came over to my house, there was one option.

363
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,180
 We're not doing PB&J, you get bologna and cheese

364
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,780
 and ketchup, or do you want mayonnaise?

365
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,060
 This is what you gotta call, and we loved it.

366
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,540
 I mean, every single day, we're taking

367
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,740
 the little red lining off the outside.

368
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,160
 Mom goes out of town, it's like, dude,

369
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,180
 we're gonna stack this thing

370
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,700
 with 12 pieces of bologna in here,

371
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,180
 this disgusting meat made of the ends of a cow

372
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,460
 they just throw in a blender,

373
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,600
 and we're like, this is incredible, it's delicious,

374
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,440
 this is great, love it.

375
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,760
 And then something happened.

376
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,660
 Like this thing that I loved and I consumed so much of,

377
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,120
 at some point, I was introduced to something called

378
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,760
 the other deli meats, or actual deli meats.

379
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,160
 And things like turkey, and at some point,

380
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,040
 like in middle school, roast beef and chicken,

381
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,600
 this is crazy, what have I been eating in bologna

382
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,980
 all of these years, and this superior taste

383
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,040
 made it so easy to disregard it,

384
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,680
 made, I found something better inside of that.

385
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,000
 And Peter begins to say that, look,

386
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,740
 this is the Christian life, that you and I begin to,

387
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,920
 I mean, to this day, like it literally changed.

388
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,240
 When I smell bologna, the thing that I consume so much of,

389
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,660
 I like can smell it right now,

390
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,520
 and it like makes me wanna throw up a little bit.

391
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,000
 That's how like, oh my gosh, I cannot believe

392
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,400
 that it was normal to me.

393
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,960
 And he says, this is what happens with the Christian life.

394
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,880
 You find this superior taste,

395
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,920
 which comes from walking in deep relationship with God,

396
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,700
 and things begin to change.

397
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,040
 It may not happen overnight in an instant taste,

398
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,160
 but it begins to change, and the more you consume,

399
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,640
 the more you want of Christ.

400
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,000
 I mean, I've seen it so many times.

401
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,400
 I have a friend, one of my favorite volunteers

402
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,240
 that we've ever had here.

403
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,600
 I remember when he came to Christ a few years ago,

404
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,560
 and he was in this discipleship group that I was leading.

405
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,880
 We were talking about following Jesus

406
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,800
 and what that looked like, and he wanted to do it,

407
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,320
 and he said, look, dude, I'm all in,

408
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,320
 except for two things, weed and sex with my girlfriend.

409
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
 And I was like, okay, got it, you're all in,

410
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,720
 except for weed and women, so you're not all in, okay?

411
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,240
 And he said, yeah, look, I'm all in,

412
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,700
 except for these two things.

413
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,000
 And he kept filling his life with God's word,

414
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,760
 and he kept coming and kept getting disciple.

415
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,380
 And the thing that, you know what I didn't say to him

416
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,220
 in that moment?

417
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,360
 I wasn't like, dude, hey, if you're gonna,

418
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,820
 before you begin to follow Jesus,

419
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,400
 you need to stop doing those things.

420
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,560
 I said, you need to begin to follow Jesus.

421
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,320
 And he kept coming, and he kept studying God's word,

422
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,380
 and he kept surrounding himself by community,

423
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,660
 and honestly, when you're around him today,

424
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,660
 like, it would be hard for you to imagine him

425
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,420
 like not being like a seminary professor or something.

426
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,580
 He's a guy whose Bible's all marked up,

427
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,380
 he knows where the scripture passage is all,

428
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,780
 he's discipling people, he's now married,

429
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,680
 he's not smoking weed, like, everything has changed

430
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,640
 in his life.

431
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,100
 And the guy was like, man, I just can't,

432
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,020
 I'm not, I'll probably never, ever give up weed and women.

433
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,140
 Like, it's not even, not even something

434
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,780
 he's considering anymore.

435
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,540
 Not that there's not temptation to lust

436
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,420
 and things like that, it's just like this whole new person.

437
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,740
 How did it change?

438
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,140
 He began to consume and fill his mind

439
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,500
 and fill his life with the things of God,

440
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,540
 things that grew him in his faith,

441
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,980
 and all of a sudden, these things just fell off.

442
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,560
 This is the Christian life.

443
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,300
 Some of you inside of the room, if you're not growing,

444
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,660
 Paul and Peter would say, hey, every Christian,

445
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,760
 if you wanna experience your purpose,

446
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,640
 you should be growing.

447
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,340
 And if you are not growing up, if your relationship

448
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,540
 or your faith is not growing, you are not experiencing

449
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,220
 this part of your purpose.

450
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,300
 God doesn't have you just sit there statically.

451
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,140
 He wants you to continue to grow,

452
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,020
 to be more like Christ in a year from now

453
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,200
 than you are now.

454
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,140
 For me to be more like Christ tomorrow than I was today,

455
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,460
 that he wants all of us to begin to grow.

456
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,900
 And I think a lot of you, the reason why people will come

457
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,340
 and they'll gather, maybe they go to church,

458
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,680
 and they're like, man, but I just am not growing.

459
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,620
 You're not feeding yourself the things

460
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,420
 that Peter would say will lead to your growth.

461
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,600
 You can hear a sermon all day, but at some point,

462
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,160
 you gotta feed yourself.

463
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,780
 You gotta study God's word yourself.

464
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,100
 You gotta walk in community with other believers yourself.

465
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,000
 And if you don't, you will never grow.

466
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,680
 And you're gonna finish 2017 and be probably

467
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,860
 just about the same, maybe even worse than it started.

468
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,580
 And Peter says, look, you're gonna miss out on your purpose.

469
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,580
 Don't waste another day, don't waste another year.

470
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,060
 How are you doing personally?

471
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,140
 By filling yourself, consuming things

472
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,700
 that are gonna grow your faith.

473
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,780
 He says, if you do so, you will experience your purpose.

474
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,340
 And then he goes into our second idea

475
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,820
 about one of the aspects of how we experience

476
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,660
 that personal growth.

477
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,260
 Here's what he says, starting in verse four.

478
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,660
 As you come to him, Jesus, the living stone,

479
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,100
 rejected by humans, but chosen by God and precious to him,

480
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,540
 you also, like living stones, are being built

481
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,780
 into this spiritual house to be a holy priesthood,

482
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,420
 offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God

483
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,540
 through Jesus Christ.

484
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,180
 For as it says in scripture, see, I lay a stone in Zion,

485
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,620
 a chosen and precious cornerstone, that's Christ.

486
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,780
 And anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.

487
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,500
 Now, to you who believe, the stone is precious.

488
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,100
 But to those who do not believe, the stone

489
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,380
 that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone

490
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,860
 and a stone that causes people to stumble

491
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,080
 and a rock that makes them fall.

492
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,820
 They stumble because they disobey the message,

493
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,160
 which they were also destined for, so much that he says,

494
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,580
 but here's one of the key things that he says,

495
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,640
 is that God is like building something.

496
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,420
 When you become a Christian, you are,

497
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,100
 he uses the word analogy, you're like this living stone.

498
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,620
 It's like God takes Jesus, he's this cornerstone,

499
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,540
 and everything else is built around it.

500
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,500
 He begins to place, if you became a Christian,

501
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,280
 you're all of a sudden entered into this big spiritual house

502
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,100
 that God is building, where you're connected

503
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,180
 to other stones, other living stones like you,

504
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,600
 and you're ultimately all connected to Christ.

505
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,260
 That you and I are connected to one another,

506
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,500
 and all of us connected to one another

507
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,180
 through Christ, ultimately.

508
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,480
 What Peter points out is what the Bible teaches

509
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,500
 over and over again, is that there is no,

510
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
 hey, I'm just a solo living stone,

511
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,040
 I can do this thing all by myself.

512
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,020
 I can live the Christian life all by myself.

513
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,600
 I don't really need to be connected to other people.

514
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,020
 We would go, look, intrinsic.

515
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,540
 It's at the heart of Christianity

516
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
 that you would be connected to other people.

517
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,140
 In other words, just like in that scenario,

518
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,020
 he says, you're a living stone,

519
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,500
 you're supposed to be a part of this house,

520
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,460
 you're not to be some stone that's over there,

521
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,020
 rogue, all by yourself.

522
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,200
 The Christian faith is meant to be lived

523
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,480
 in community, in connection with one another.

524
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,820
 The second idea from this text

525
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,220
 is that we're built up together on Christ.

526
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,420
 If you wanna experience your purpose in life,

527
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,820
 you will not experience it if you are not connected deeply

528
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,980
 to other believers.

529
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,360
 Like, if you're not a part of a church,

530
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,440
 you're not a community group,

531
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,980
 you are not gonna experience your purpose in life,

532
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,340
 and neither will I.

533
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,660
 God designed the church to work that way.

534
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,100
 He really designed humanity to work that way.

535
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,580
 But even more so for the church,

536
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,300
 he says, look, a part of this deal

537
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,740
 is that you would be connected to other believers.

538
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,640
 God is building this spiritual house together.

539
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,620
 This is why the idea that,

540
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,780
 man, you hear this all the time, too.

541
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,300
 Hey, look, dude, I love Jesus, I'm just not big on church.

542
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,580
 Like, I love God, and I'm for that, and I love Jesus,

543
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,940
 but I'm just not big on church.

544
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,660
 Church is kinda boring, I don't really like it,

545
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,380
 but I'm cool with Jesus, he's my homeboy, I love Jesus.

546
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,540
 Here's why that's a bad idea.

547
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,920
 First off, the Bible calls the church

548
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,100
 the bride or the fiance of Christ.

549
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,260
 Like, think about that.

550
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,740
 Essentially what you're saying is like,

551
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,060
 dude, hey, Jesus, I'm cool with you,

552
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,340
 I'm just not cool with your fiance.

553
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,740
 What guy in the world is ever gonna be cool

554
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,700
 with his buddies being like,

555
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,900
 dude, man, you my boy, man, but your girl,

556
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,860
 man, she is something else, a little lame.

557
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,660
 And what guy's gonna be like,

558
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,920
 yeah, man, yeah, she is lame, come on.

559
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,640
 Think about that, that's essentially what you say

560
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,120
 when you say to Jesus, look, I'm cool with you,

561
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,360
 I'm just not cool with your fiance, your bride, the church.

562
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,000
 The Christian life has always been meant

563
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
 for you to be connected, to be a part of it,

564
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,040
 and Christ said, look, I love my church, I love my bride.

565
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,620
 You don't like it because there's broken sinners in there?

566
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,380
 Man, come join the crowd just like you.

567
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,920
 But I love my bride.

568
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,480
 The Christian life has always been meant

569
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,520
 for you to be connected to the body of Christ.

570
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,960
 And if you're not connected because you don't like

571
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,120
 the church, you are not connected because you say to Jesus,

572
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,280
 I just don't like your fiance, I'm fine with you.

573
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,520
 And you insult God's way to live.

574
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,880
 And my guess is you insult your Savior,

575
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,020
 who says, I love my bride, I'll die for my bride.

576
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,000
 At the heart of Christianity is really this idea

577
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,280
 that you and I are to be connected like living stones,

578
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,640
 resting on top of one another on the cornerstone.

579
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,240
 We're gonna talk about the cornerstone in a second.

580
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,760
 But this idea of connected to one another,

581
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,880
 I mean, it's so over and over and over again

582
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,480
 that you read Hebrews 10, 24, Hebrews 3, 13,

583
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,800
 all throughout the Psalms where it talks about

584
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,240
 how blessed it is that when brothers dwell in you,

585
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,200
 that we're meant to live this life

586
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,320
 connected to one another.

587
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,880
 Christianity, as we've said before, is a team sport.

588
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,740
 You cannot play by yourself.

589
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,120
 Like, it's like any team sport.

590
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,960
 I mean, think about it.

591
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,400
 I don't know if anybody would play basketball in here,

592
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,680
 baseball, we'll just go with basketball.

593
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,880
 Like, you cannot play basketball with a single person.

594
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,700
 You think about that?

595
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,360
 Because basketball is a team sport.

596
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 Like, no, man, I could shoot free throws all day long.

597
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,640
 That's not called playing basketball.

598
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,960
 That's called practice.

599
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,960
 You cannot play the sport of basketball without teammates.

600
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,880
 It was designed as a team sport.

601
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,880
 Christianity is the same way.

602
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,800
 And you cannot participate, you cannot play the game

603
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,840
 without being deeply connected to one another.

604
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,720
 What am I saying?

605
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
 If you are not a member of a church,

606
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,680
 you will not experience your purpose this year.

607
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,640
 You're not experiencing your purpose right now.

608
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,800
 And I'm not talking to the guy who's like,

609
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,400
 look, I have been praying and fasting for the last week,

610
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,800
 and I'm trying to find which church,

611
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,880
 God, local church he wants me to be a part of.

612
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
 That person, man, God bless you,

613
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,800
 keep going if we can answer questions.

614
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,900
 I'm talking to the person who's like,

615
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,760
 yeah, I moved to Dallas a little bit ago,

616
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,640
 and I'm trying to figure it out,

617
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,460
 been going around, checking a few places out.

618
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,080
 Like this place on Tuesday, like this place on Sunday.

619
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,800
 This is my every other Sunday place.

620
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,980
 That's the person.

621
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,300
 But God says, man, go all in, connect.

622
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,940
 There is no perfect church.

623
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,840
 There's just imperfect people devoted to a perfect Savior.

624
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,560
 Join the crowd, use yourself and your gifts

625
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,560
 and who's God made you to make his church even stronger.

626
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,840
 Christianity is a team sport.

627
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,200
 If you're not connected, you're not playing it.

628
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,240
 He uses the idea of the foundation, a cornerstone.

629
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,580
 So in the ancient world, they wouldn't build the foundation

630
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,120
 or they wouldn't build them the same way we do today.

631
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,300
 A cornerstone essentially was like,

632
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,160
 it was the rock, the most important rock

633
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,000
 that everything else was built on top of.

634
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,960
 It was the most valuable, they would take the most time

635
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,680
 selecting and choosing which stone

636
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,800
 that everything would be built on,

637
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,540
 and the cornerstone, because every other stone

638
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,800
 rested indirectly on the cornerstone.

639
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,400
 You take the cornerstone out, everything will crumble.

640
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,700
 And Peter says, this is how the church of Christ is.

641
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,500
 This is how Christianity is to be lived.

642
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,260
 It's like Christ is the center.

643
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,020
 He's the thing that all of life is to be built around,

644
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,860
 and all of us, and we're connected to other people

645
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,520
 who build their life around him.

646
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,660
 A cornerstone is the thing that everything's built around.

647
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,500
 In the same way, he says,

648
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,460
 Jesus is the cornerstone of your life,

649
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,880
 and he's to be the cornerstone of the church.

650
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,360
 You and I are to build our life around him.

651
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,480
 You got relationships, I got relationships,

652
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,640
 where we have friends, there's groups of people,

653
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,600
 they build their lives around lots of things.

654
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,580
 People build their lives around,

655
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,240
 hey, where's the next party at?

656
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,760
 People build their lives around the weekend,

657
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,500
 like, hey, everything kind of revolves around the weekend,

658
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,580
 and I can't make that change 'cause I'm going out here.

659
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,820
 People build their lives.

660
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,660
 They change everything about their lives

661
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,040
 around making more money.

662
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,900
 I'm gonna move to this city, I'm gonna do that job.

663
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,460
 People build their lives on a lot of things.

664
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,500
 He says, for Christians,

665
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,940
 they are to build their lives around Christ,

666
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,220
 and surround themselves with other people

667
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,500
 who build their lives around Christ.

668
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,780
 As we say often, man, you gotta change your playmates

669
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,240
 and your playground, that you build your life around Christ,

670
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,860
 which involves, by the way,

671
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,580
 being surrounded by other people

672
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,580
 who are building their life around Christ.

673
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,020
 Change your playmates and playgrounds,

674
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,100
 or change your team and your teammates,

675
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,020
 to use the sports analogy from earlier.

676
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,660
 Peter says, if you wanna experience your purpose,

677
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,580
 it won't happen by you just coming on a Tuesday

678
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,620
 and being sincere, and I love the music, and this is great,

679
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,420
 but it will not happen if you just leave here

680
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,220
 and you go back to the same friends,

681
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,980
 go back to the same toxic relationships,

682
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,700
 the same friends who are not trying to lift you up,

683
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,100
 but are pulling you down,

684
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,780
 even though they don't even realize it.

685
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,860
 Nobody's like intentionally like,

686
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,780
 dude, I gotta pull you down.

687
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,100
 They just, by their presence

688
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,140
 and what they're inviting you to participate in,

689
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,100
 are going to, and Peter says,

690
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,740
 you won't experience your purpose, you won't grow,

691
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,500
 and you will miss out on what God has created

692
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,460
 and given you salvation for.

693
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,460
 You're missing out on life if you're not connected

694
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,420
 and being built up with a together on Christ.

695
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,060
 He finishes and gives us the last thing,

696
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,780
 and it's a part of just this new life

697
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,540
 and the purpose that we have for it,

698
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,340
 a part of our purpose

699
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,580
 as those who have the new life in Christ.

700
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,940
 He says this in verse nine,

701
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,740
 but you are a chosen people,

702
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,660
 a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession.

703
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,460
 He chose you, you're this holy royal priesthood.

704
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,940
 He identifies all these different figurative expressions

705
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,780
 of the Old Testament.

706
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,260
 In other words, the Old Testament

707
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,620
 had three authority figures,

708
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,140
 the priest, the king, and the prophet,

709
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,340
 and Peter says, man, there's no more elites

710
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,300
 in God's kingdom.

711
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,740
 You're a royal priesthood.

712
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,340
 It's like you make up part of the king.

713
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,660
 It's like you make up part of the priesthood.

714
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,020
 He's about to say you declare, which is what a prophet do.

715
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,460
 In Christ, there's no elites.

716
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,380
 It's level ground.

717
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,600
 Christ has made something new, and he chose you,

718
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,820
 not chose you because of you.

719
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,500
 He chose you in spite of you and in spite of me,

720
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,620
 and you are God's special or treasured possession,

721
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,860
 he says when he looks at you,

722
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,220
 and he says that he chose you for a reason,

723
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,780
 which is this, end of verse nine,

724
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,380
 chose that you would declare the praises of him

725
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,400
 who called you out of darkness

726
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,940
 and into his wonderful light.

727
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,160
 Once you were not a people, but now you are a people.

728
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,600
 Once you had not received mercy,

729
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,200
 but now you have received the mercy of God,

730
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,440
 that he gives us our third idea,

731
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,160
 which is God chose you for a reason.

732
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,760
 There's a purpose behind it,

733
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,280
 specifically that you would declare the praises

734
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,080
 of him who called you out of darkness

735
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,280
 and into his marvelous light.

736
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,600
 Our third idea from the text is like,

737
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,380
 what's the third component of experiencing your purpose?

738
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,440
 The first one is growing up.

739
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,040
 You've gotta grow up by knowing God's word

740
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,840
 and having others around you, God's people around you.

741
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,660
 The second one is that you're built up together.

742
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,960
 You're meant to be connected to the body of Christ.

743
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,480
 And the third one comes from sharing the message of Christ.

744
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,280
 You grow up in Christ, you're built together on Christ,

745
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,420
 and now we as those who've been chosen,

746
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,360
 we go share the message of Christ.

747
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,840
 All three are deeply a part of your purpose.

748
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,440
 You will not experience it apart from this.

749
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,400
 He says that I saved you to go send you out into the world.

750
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,440
 I saved you not just so that you would sit in your chair

751
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,480
 and that you'd sing some songs,

752
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,560
 but that you would now be able to go out

753
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,680
 into the places you work, in the places that you live,

754
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,000
 in the family tables that you sit at,

755
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,860
 to every single place that you would begin to go declare,

756
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,400
 not the praises of watermark or the porch or of yourself

757
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,520
 or of whatever skills and abilities you have,

758
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,760
 but you would declare the praises of Christ

759
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,320
 or of Jesus, of God, the one who called you out of darkness,

760
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,520
 who changed your life if you're a Christian.

761
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,160
 At the heart of your purpose is this idea

762
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,620
 of sharing the Christian message.

763
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,640
 Or you may have heard it called evangelism,

764
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,360
 that you would go and you'd go tell people

765
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,920
 about what God has done for you.

766
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,040
 You will not experience your purpose if you said,

767
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,140
 nope, I'm definitely not gonna go do that.

768
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,480
 I think some of the barriers, honestly,

769
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,800
 to where why we don't go share the message

770
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,440
 are maybe the most helpful things to talk through,

771
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,280
 'cause here's some of the things

772
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,360
 that I feel like I hear all the time about,

773
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,120
 like, dude, I'm just not very good at that,

774
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,160
 I get so uncomfortable, I get my palms are sweating right now

775
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,640
 thinking about it, and all that's understandable.

776
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,600
 And then some of them come,

777
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,040
 I wrote down some of the barriers that I'll hear,

778
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,060
 like, hey, man, I just, I'm not perfect,

779
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,040
 so I feel like if I go share,

780
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,440
 I gotta have it all together.

781
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,700
 You're not perfect.

782
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,860
 That's the point.

783
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,640
 You can't be a Christian if you say,

784
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,880
 hey, just, you wanna worship my God?

785
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,840
 I'm perfect.

786
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,840
 No one who is a Christian has that message.

787
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,120
 You're not a Christian if you think that.

788
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,720
 A person, a Christian is somebody who says,

789
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,880
 I'm not perfect.

790
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,120
 I have a perfect Savior, I'm imperfect.

791
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,760
 I imperfectly love Him now,

792
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,960
 I've imperfectly lived in my past,

793
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,800
 and I'll imperfectly live in my future,

794
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,000
 but I have a perfect Savior

795
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,980
 who is driving out the fear in my life

796
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,400
 with His perfect love, and I'm finding freedom in Him.

797
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,720
 That's the message of Christianity,

798
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,120
 you being like, hey, but I'm not perfect,

799
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,320
 and I just feel like I don't have it.

800
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,360
 That's the point, just say to your coworkers,

801
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,920
 look, I'm a hypocrite,

802
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,100
 but do you know that Jesus died for you on the cross,

803
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,100
 just like He died for my hypocrisy, for my sin in my life?

804
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,140
 And whoever just trusts in Him will have eternal life?

805
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,080
 That's what you do.

806
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,720
 The fact that you're not perfect isn't a barrier,

807
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,400
 it's a platform, if anything.

808
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,840
 He goes, another one is that, like, man,

809
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,060
 well, I'm just introverted,

810
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,020
 or I don't have the gift of evangelism.

811
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,640
 I don't know that it matters.

812
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,920
 I mean, no one would say, like, ah, yeah,

813
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,960
 don't, yeah, don't experience your purpose, that's fine.

814
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,800
 You live your whole life and be purposeless.

815
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,840
 You're an introvert.

816
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,220
 No one would say that's okay, right?

817
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,360
 Like, how tragic is it if somebody's like,

818
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,820
 no, I just can't, I cannot,

819
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,700
 I'm stepping up to the line of the purpose for my existence,

820
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,620
 and I think I'm good.

821
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,420
 I'm gonna go sit in a corner by myself

822
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,020
 and experience introvertedness.

823
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,620
 Like, that's so crazy.

824
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,500
 But I, like, resonate, I have a heart for that,

825
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,260
 because I think some of the reasons why introverts,

826
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,740
 or all of us could struggle with sharing,

827
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,860
 is because we just don't know exactly how.

828
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,620
 How do you get into the conversation?

829
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,980
 How do I do it in a way that's not just weird and awkward,

830
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,220
 and they're like, oh, man, that guy,

831
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,900
 just Jesus juked me, and he's like, is that coffee hot?

832
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,740
 You know what's really hot?

833
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,580
 Hell.

834
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,180
 Have you heard of how you don't have to go there?

835
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,660
 Like, how do you do it in a way that's not awkward

836
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,860
 and not that way?

837
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,400
 But that may be gold, man.

838
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,040
 Somebody try that, and it may work.

839
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,880
 We'll be like.

840
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,220
 Gotta keep going.

841
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,380
 How do you get in the conversation?

842
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,900
 Here's some things, like, super tactically,

843
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,780
 this was so helpful to me.

844
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,060
 I remember, like, moving to Watermark eight years ago,

845
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,120
 and it was the place that I'd never seen

846
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,220
 just examples of what this looks like so well.

847
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,380
 JP being one of them, it's one of the best in the world

848
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,200
 that I know of.

849
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,700
 Todd has just created, our senior pastor's created

850
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,340
 a culture on here that's so good.

851
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,140
 I remember hearing just tactical sentences

852
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,800
 that helped me so much more get in the conversation.

853
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,260
 Things like this, that I use all the time,

854
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,380
 which is any time they were out and about,

855
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,940
 asking the question, hey, do you have a faith?

856
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,000
 Like, do you have a faith?

857
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,340
 And they'll go, what, of what?

858
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,840
 Do you have faith, like a belief, a religion?

859
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,700
 And they'll either go, yes, I do, it's X,

860
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,740
 or no, I don't, or I did growing up, and you're N.

861
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,820
 Oh, cool, hey, can I tell you what I believe?

862
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,940
 Things like this, I mean, this happened a few weeks ago

863
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,400
 at a friend that I was talking with

864
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,340
 that worked at Barnes & Noble,

865
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,220
 and we were talking about faith

866
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,060
 and talking about Christianity, and he was like,

867
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,180
 nah, man, I don't really do that.

868
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,080
 And I just said, man, hey, you're clearly an educated guy.

869
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,280
 Do you know what the central message of the Bible is?

870
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,120
 Like, if you were to, like, distill it into a sentence,

871
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,940
 I mean, I know you're clearly intelligent,

872
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,540
 so I'm sure you'd wanna know if you don't know,

873
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,740
 but do you know what it is?

874
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,140
 And he was like, man, I don't know if I could exactly put it

875
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,900
 you know, God and a religious system.

876
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,020
 Hey, let me tell you,

877
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,860
 the central message of the Bible is this,

878
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,220
 that God created the world.

879
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,100
 Man disobeyed God and he introduced sin.

880
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,300
 And God, rather than allow man to keep running from him

881
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,380
 and keep rebelling him, or just to kill him

882
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,160
 and wipe him out, decided that he would become a man

883
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,780
 and that he would die for the creation,

884
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,940
 the mankind that he made in his image,

885
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,660
 the creation he's crazy about.

886
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:20,560
 Essentially, in a few words, it's God loved, so God gave.

887
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,300
 That's the message of Christianity.

888
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,140
 Messages are questions like, hey, you know, I mean,

889
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,060
 I feel like there's just little tactical things

890
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,980
 that are super helpful.

891
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,120
 Easter's about to come up.

892
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,300
 Here's what you can do at your table.

893
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,660
 You're eating dinner, you're eating breakfast,

894
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,220
 you're coming, there's a waiter that comes up.

895
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,980
 Hey, we were just talking about Easter.

896
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,340
 And, you know, what do you think?

897
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,980
 So Jesus dies, do you think he rises from the dead or not?

898
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,860
 It's a common, it's like a current event

899
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,460
 that's taking place in culture.

900
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,820
 Immediately ask him, or ask him,

901
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,140
 they're not gonna be like, what the,

902
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,460
 here's your food, unbelievable!

903
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,140
 This is crazy!

904
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,460
 They're gonna go, oh, man, I don't know, man,

905
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,580
 I don't know, and you just go, hey, can I tell you

906
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,060
 that I believe that he rose from the dead?

907
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,220
 Here's why that's important.

908
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,700
 Because the Bible doesn't teach good people go to heaven

909
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,260
 and forgiven, or I mean, and bad people go to hell.

910
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
 It doesn't teach good people in heaven, bad people no.

911
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,060
 It teaches forgiven people go to heaven.

912
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,460
 And there's only one way to get forgiveness.

913
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,980
 Bad people get forgiveness, good people,

914
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,220
 by our standards, get forgiveness.

915
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,460
 But it can only happen one way,

916
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,020
 which is trusting in Jesus and what he did on the cross,

917
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,500
 dying for you and rising again.

918
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,860
 Why do I believe that Jesus came back alive?

919
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,180
 One, because he changed my life,

920
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,900
 but two, 'cause it's at the heart

921
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,540
 of what the Bible and the gospel teaches.

922
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,040
 If he didn't rise from the dead,

923
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,300
 we worship a guy who just died.

924
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,280
 Everybody dies.

925
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,940
 We worship a guy who conquered death,

926
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,680
 and he changed the world, and he's changing my world.

927
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,020
 Would you like to come to Easter?

928
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,340
 That coffee's hot.

929
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,340
 [audience laughing]

930
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,620
 Or just, this is another barrier that people have.

931
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,780
 So I don't know how to get in the conversation.

932
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,380
 There's a couple different ways

933
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,660
 to get into the conversation.

934
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,420
 But even, I mean, just think about this.

935
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,820
 Here's the problem with most people.

936
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,580
 And if you're like, dude, this doesn't work for me,

937
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,420
 it kind of works for you,

938
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,500
 here's all I want to challenge you to do.

939
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,660
 If you don't ever share your faith,

940
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,860
 here's the challenge for you.

941
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,180
 Just begin to think about,

942
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,140
 if you were gonna share your faith in a situation,

943
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,700
 what could it possibly look like?

944
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,420
 Your coworker's sitting there talking about

945
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,700
 how hopeless the situation in his personal life is.

946
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,860
 Maybe you begin to go, man, if I was gonna share,

947
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,900
 I'm not going to, but if I was, I would be like,

948
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,980
 you know what, I've found hope in the midst of stuff.

949
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,780
 That's been my faith in Christ.

950
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,020
 Yeah, that's how I think I would do it.

951
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,900
 Not gonna do it, but that's how I would do it.

952
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,540
 Just begin to think about it.

953
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,380
 All I'm asking you to do, I'm daring you,

954
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,420
 step up to the edge for the purpose of your existence

955
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,980
 and just take a look over to see what it could look like

956
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,940
 on the other side.

957
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,060
 It's at the heart of why you have your faith.

958
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,780
 Peter says, look, you're given this salvation

959
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,300
 to proclaim about the God who saved you,

960
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,700
 called you out of darkness.

961
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,220
 Not smart enough, maybe you're going, man,

962
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,500
 I don't know evolution and tectonic plates or dinosaurs.

963
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,340
 Here's what no one can deny, no one can debate,

964
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,640
 your own story.

965
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,460
 This is what Christ has done in my life

966
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,480
 and what he's doing in my life.

967
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,820
 We teach our volunteers how to share in three minutes

968
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,540
 their testimony, we call it,

969
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,540
 which is one minute on before I met Christ,

970
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,580
 one minute on how I met Christ,

971
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,020
 and one minute on since I've met Christ,

972
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,460
 how he's either saved me and the things he saved me from,

973
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,660
 and also he's continuing to work in my life.

974
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,260
 And if you're a Christian in the room,

975
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,300
 nobody can debate that.

976
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,860
 They can debate evolution all day long.

977
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,020
 They can't debate that.

978
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,620
 And Peter says, man, you're just telling people

979
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,020
 the way that God has worked inside of your life.

980
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,900
 The final thing that Peter points out

981
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,260
 is we do this together.

982
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,340
 The way that we spread the message of Christianity

983
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,740
 is we just go around together,

984
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,060
 like we're stronger together.

985
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,420
 I'm more likely to share my faith

986
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,740
 when I'm with brothers and sisters in Christ,

987
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,360
 out and about.

988
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,540
 I'm more likely to share my faith,

989
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,100
 even if I'm by myself, you know,

990
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,980
 doing, running errands or whatever it is,

991
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,940
 if I have people encouraging me

992
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,700
 and holding me accountable

993
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,260
 and raising that banner in front of me

994
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,900
 in my own community group, which they are,

995
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,460
 that we're all more likely to do this,

996
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,180
 we're all less likely to do it alone,

997
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,180
 and we're all more likely to do it

998
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,020
 when we come together.

999
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,940
 Peter says plural, the you in that,

1000
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,100
 but you is a plural, it's y'all,

1001
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,620
 or you all, if you will.

1002
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,300
 And he says y'all are a chosen race

1003
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,900
 to declare the praises of God.

1004
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,140
 All of you together is what the church

1005
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,780
 is intended to be, just go around declaring,

1006
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,140
 not how amazing you are,

1007
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,100
 how amazing is our God.

1008
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,960
 He doesn't demand anything from you.

1009
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,180
 He's done something for you,

1010
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,240
 and we take that message every place.

1011
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,860
 We tell people that the Bible doesn't teach

1012
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,500
 whosoever behaves shall not perish,

1013
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,340
 but have eternal life.

1014
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,660
 It says whosoever believes

1015
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,420
 will not perish, but have eternal life.

1016
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,780
 And we take that message to the streets of Dallas,

1017
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,180
 the streets of Fort Worth, every place.

1018
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,020
 Because we're perfect?

1019
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,660
 No, because we found someone who is,

1020
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,100
 and he is working inside of our life,

1021
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,100
 he's growing us, he's building us together

1022
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,580
 as a priesthood, and he has allowed us

1023
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,260
 just the privilege to be a part of sharing

1024
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,740
 and taking his message across the world.

1025
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,200
 I'll finish with just this last verse,

1026
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,540
 which is verse 10, where it says this.

1027
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,240
 Once you were not a people,

1028
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,700
 but now you are God's people.

1029
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,020
 Once you had not received mercy,

1030
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,260
 but now you have received mercy.

1031
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,080
 I love this.

1032
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:39,420
 Peter finishes this passage with a direct quote

1033
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,580
 from the book of Hosea.

1034
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,620
 Like this isn't like a made up thing.

1035
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,180
 He literally, he rips it out.

1036
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,880
 He plagiarizes from Hosea,

1037
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,720
 and he takes it and he says,

1038
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,100
 "This was a prophecy given that's been fulfilled here."

1039
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,980
 What's the prophecy?

1040
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,300
 What's going on in the book of Hosea?

1041
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,180
 Hosea is a book of the Bible that contains this story

1042
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,500
 where God comes to this prophet,

1043
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,900
 who in prophets were these people

1044
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,940
 that God would basically speak to the nation

1045
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,980
 through the prophet.

1046
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,580
 He was there, "Hey, I'm gonna come speak to the nation

1047
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,260
 "through you and through your life.

1048
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,780
 "I'm gonna showcase myself to them."

1049
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,860
 And God comes to Hosea, and it's at this time

1050
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,560
 when the nation of Israel has run from God.

1051
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,140
 The nation of Israel is what the Old Testament

1052
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,220
 is all about, and it's the story,

1053
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,180
 or inside of the story of Hosea,

1054
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,700
 it's where the nation has basically said,

1055
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,740
 "We're done with God.

1056
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,980
 "We're gonna go worship other gods.

1057
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,740
 "We're gonna do whatever we want."

1058
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,440
 And God comes to Hosea, and he says,

1059
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,140
 "I want you to go marry a prostitute.

1060
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,780
 "I want you to go marry a woman directly."

1061
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,740
 It says in verse two of chapter one of Hosea,

1062
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,020
 that when the Lord first spoke to Hosea,

1063
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,200
 he said, "Go and take yourself a wife of Horeb,

1064
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,500
 "and I want you to have children of Horeb,

1065
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,760
 "for the land commits Horeb by forsaking the Lord."

1066
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,780
 And it tells us that he goes and he marries this prostitute.

1067
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,200
 I mean, this is the scene where Hosea is going,

1068
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,260
 "Man, am I sure this is God right now?

1069
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,000
 "This really sounds like the devil.

1070
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,880
 "He's telling me to marry a prostitute named Gomer?

1071
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,940
 "They don't even have a cool prostitute name.

1072
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,940
 "Gomer?

1073
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,820
 "Like cinnamon or magic or something, Gomer."

1074
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,540
 (congregation laughing)

1075
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,500
 And God says, "I want you to for a very specific reason."

1076
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,300
 (laughing)

1077
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,620
 "I want you to," magic.

1078
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,120
 "I want you to for a very specific reason, keep away.

1079
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,220
 "Because in doing so, she is going to cheat on you

1080
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,220
 "over and over and over and over again.

1081
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,060
 "You're gonna marry this woman

1082
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,060
 "and she's gonna cheat on you time after time.

1083
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,380
 "She's gonna go sleep with other men.

1084
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,220
 "And I'm gonna put it in your heart to love her,

1085
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,300
 "and you're gonna go after her

1086
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,980
 "every single time she's gonna run from you.

1087
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,740
 "Here's why, because you will show the world,

1088
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,440
 "you'll show the nation of Israel.

1089
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,940
 "You will show how I feel when my people turn to other gods.

1090
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,400
 "Now my heart breaks.

1091
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,420
 "And the same love that I'll never stop loving you

1092
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,160
 "is I'm gonna put in your heart, Hosea,

1093
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,660
 "you're gonna go after Gomer.

1094
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,080
 "Just like I love them."

1095
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,980
 The scripture tells us that eventually

1096
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,460
 she's running away from God,

1097
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,100
 and, or she's running away from Hosea,

1098
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,380
 and she's sleeping with these different men.

1099
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,980
 And one day, she comes back home and she's pregnant.

1100
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:11,820
 And she gives birth to a little baby girl.

1101
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,180
 And God says, "I want you to call him,

1102
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,520
 "or call her, Lo-Ami, not my people.

1103
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,260
 "Because my people have said, you're not our God."

1104
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,620
 She keeps sleeping around and eventually comes back,

1105
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,060
 she's pregnant again with some other guy's baby.

1106
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,660
 And he says, "Call the boy this time,

1107
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,820
 "Lo-Ramah, not receive the mercy."

1108
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,960
 She continues to sleep around,

1109
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,020
 and she continues to go so far as eventually

1110
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,460
 she sells herself into prostitution.

1111
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,940
 She becomes the property of another man.

1112
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,860
 And Hosea eventually hears that,

1113
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,180
 "Man, where's my wife, who I love?"

1114
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,020
 And he finds out that she's been sold,

1115
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,120
 she's like on an auction block to be sold.

1116
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,140
 And the Spirit of God comes, Hosea chapter three,

1117
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,360
 and it says that the Lord came to Hosea and said,

1118
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,360
 "Go and love a woman who's an adulteress."

1119
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:19,460
 Just like the love of the Lord for the nation of Israel.

1120
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,640
 Though they turn their backs and they commit idolatry,

1121
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,740
 and they run towards other gods.

1122
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,700
 "Go love her again, Hosea."

1123
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,740
 And he goes and loves her.

1124
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,400
 He sees her on the auction block.

1125
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,380
 And he sees, I mean, she's about to be sold.

1126
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,220
 Somebody's standing there like,

1127
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,660
 "Hey, what's the highest price I'll take you?"

1128
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,220
 He says, "Man, that's my wife.

1129
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,500
 "This is how much she costs.

1130
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,440
 "He doesn't even have enough money."

1131
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,620
 So he takes these 15 shekels,

1132
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,940
 we're told he takes all the money that he has,

1133
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,820
 and he has to go home and like get some of his stuff

1134
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,940
 and be like, "Will you take this?

1135
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,580
 "I've got this money and we take this stuff.

1136
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,340
 "Whatever the price, I'll pay it."

1137
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,300
 And he sets her free.

1138
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,700
 And inside of the book of Hosea, this prophecy is given.

1139
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,540
 These exact words where Peter picks up

1140
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,040
 and years later, the Holy Spirit says,

1141
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,900
 "This prophecy is now fulfilled."

1142
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,260
 Inside of the story where Hosea, just like God,

1143
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,740
 in the story, we're Gomer, God is Hosea,

1144
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,960
 who after time and time again of us running from him says,

1145
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,680
 "Whatever the price, I'll pay it.

1146
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,000
 "My son, I'll pay it.

1147
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,760
 "This is how much I love you.

1148
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,160
 "This is how much I love the human race.

1149
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,180
 "Though they run from me, though they rebel from me,

1150
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,700
 "though they turn their back on me,

1151
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,560
 "whatever the price, I'll pay it."

1152
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,820
 And he says inside of this book, man, I love this.

1153
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,040
 He speaks of this day and he says,

1154
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,280
 "There will come a day where these children

1155
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,000
 "that we've named not my people

1156
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,260
 "and have not received mercy,"

1157
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,860
 just like they're illegitimate children,

1158
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,940
 just like they're undeserving, just like their mother.

1159
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,180
 Yet despite all of it, I love them.

1160
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,780
 Despite all of it, Hosea loves them.

1161
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,920
 He says inside of there will come someday,

1162
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,400
 Hosea chapter two, verse 23,

1163
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,540
 someday the Lord says,

1164
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,980
 "I will look on those who I have called not my people

1165
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,400
 "and I will call them my people.

1166
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,240
 "I will look on those who I've called not received mercy

1167
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,500
 "or not loved and they will receive mercy."

1168
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,480
 And Peter says, "This prophecy has been filled."

1169
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,560
 This is the message that we go tell people.

1170
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,160
 How amazing is the God who's out there?

1171
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,680
 The story of Hosea is all seen most clearly

1172
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,120
 in the story of the cross.

1173
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,900
 We are like Gomer.

1174
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,220
 We've done nothing but run from God.

1175
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,760
 Wherever you are in the room, you're like Gomer.

1176
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,720
 Every single person you work next to is like Gomer.

1177
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,060
 It's like someone who's turned their back,

1178
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,180
 who's made themself a God,

1179
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,760
 who's chased after things in this world,

1180
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,680
 who's tried to get addicted to either pain pills

1181
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,660
 or in their rebellion has gotten addicted

1182
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,760
 to whatever it is, pornography, sexuality,

1183
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,400
 whatever it is, they've run from him.

1184
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,520
 And what does God do?

1185
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,480
 What does the heart of God do?

1186
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,140
 He runs after his people.

1187
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,480
 Whatever the price, I will pay it so that they will come

1188
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,480
 a day where I will say to those,

1189
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,460
 despite the rebellion, despite their undeserving,

1190
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,280
 many of them even think they deserve it.

1191
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,000
 That's how broken they are.

1192
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,840
 I love them.

1193
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,400
 Whatever the price, I'll pay it.

1194
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,900
 And he says, Peter says,

1195
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,460
 "That's who we are.

1196
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,700
 "And that's where we go to help people.

1197
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,100
 "That's why we go spread the message everywhere.

1198
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,180
 "Because the God who is there is greater than anyone

1199
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,500
 "could have ever imagined, has a grander love

1200
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,460
 "than anyone could ever fathom, anyone has ever experienced.

1201
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,460
 "And he loves them more than we ever could

1202
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,300
 "and we ever will.

1203
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,540
 "And he invites us to be a part of it.

1204
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,220
 "Do you know this God?

1205
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,940
 "And be a part of telling them

1206
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,980
 "about the greatness of our God

1207
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,020
 "that Hosea in his relentless pursuit

1208
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,260
 "shows just a fraction of.

1209
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,260
 "That's the God who's there.

1210
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,100
 "That's the God we tell people about.

1211
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:54,700
 "That's the God if you ever are to know him,

1212
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,380
 "you'll come to know."

1213
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,220
 Let me pray.

1214
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,580
 Father, we,

1215
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,020
 there are no words that can describe

1216
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,020
 this love that we feel.

1217
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,260
 There are no words

1218
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:15,700
 for this kind of love.

1219
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:21,140
 I can't even begin to understand how someone would sacrifice

1220
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:28,100
 a life, let alone the eternal life of God

1221
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,100
 for someone as lowly as us,

1222
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,700
 who despite just being your creation made in your image,

1223
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,380
 would love incredibly so much so

1224
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,380
 that you would give your life, whatever the price.

1225
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,940
 Would you kindle just that story, that message,

1226
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,740
 that truth inside of my heart, Lord?

1227
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,540
 Would we be more able and more readily just

1228
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:57,460
 able to share of how incredibly good our God is?

1229
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,220
 How amazing is his love?

1230
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,340
 There's no love like this in other faiths.

1231
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,740
 There's no love like this in this world.

1232
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,500
 It's found in one place, which is you, Lord.

1233
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,180
 Would you allow us to be your messengers

1234
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,740
 to experience our purpose,

1235
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,740
 which is to know you and to make you known

1236
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,460
 for anyone inside of this room who, like me,

1237
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,900
 can easily cower and not be bold to share

1238
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,340
 the hope that you alone offer?

1239
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,820
 Would you win, Lord?

1240
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,180
 And where we're weak in our hearts,

1241
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,020
 would you conquer that?

1242
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,860
 Would your perfect love cast out fear?

1243
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,700
 Father, we love you.

1244
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,780
 We thank you that you have given us the privilege

1245
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,380
 of knowing you and walking with you.

1246
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,340
 We worship you, amen.

1247
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:40,840
 Amen.

1248
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,840
 Thank you.
