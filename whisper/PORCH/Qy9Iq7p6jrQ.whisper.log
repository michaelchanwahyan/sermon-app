[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   Hey Porch, please take a seat as we read God's word together.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.200]   Today we're going to read from the book of Luke, chapter 5, verses 1 through 11.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.600]   And it says, "On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.600]   he was standing by the lake of Gesenaret, and he saw two boats by the lake,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.800]   but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.600]   Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.400]   and he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.200]   And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.800]   'Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.'
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.000]   And Simon answered, 'Master, we toiled all night and took nothing,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.800]   but at your word I will let down the nets.'
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.600]   And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.800]   They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.800]   and they came and filled both of the boats so that they began to sink.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.800]   But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.000]   'Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.'
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.800]   For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.200]   and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.200]   And Jesus said to Simon, 'Do not be afraid. From now on you will be catching men.'
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.400]   And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him."
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.200]   Now, our first message in our series called "Disciple."
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.000]   [Applause]
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.200]   - Thanks, Gabe.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.400]   Porch, how we doing? We doing okay tonight?
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.000]   Yeah, it's great to see you.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Thanks for making time to be with us here in Dallas, Texas,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.600]   as well as all over the nation. So grateful that Porch Live you would tune in.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.000]   Special shout out to Porch Live Scottsdale, Porch Live Des Moines, and Porch Live Midland.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.800]   Anybody from Midland in here?
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.000]   Well, listen, there are a handful of moments in a dating relationship
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.200]   that are defining to say the least.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.500]   From the very first time you may meet your significant other's friends,
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.800]   and you feel all the pressure of needing to make a good first impression with their people,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.700]   to the very first major disagreement the two of you have,
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.600]   and yet you know the relationship is worth fighting for,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.400]   and so you're not willing to give up on it,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.500]   and you'll go to great lengths to make sure this thing stays together,
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.100]   to the first time he calls you his girlfriend,
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.500]   and you just can't wait to let everybody else know that this is now the state of your relationship,
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.100]   or the first time you actually find yourself on a trip together,
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.800]   and you get a chance to see, like, what do they do before they go to bed?
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.500]   What is their nightly routine?
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.600]   What kind of person are they in the morning?
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.800]   To the very first time one of you risks it all,
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.900]   and says those three small yet oh-so-powerful words,
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.100]   "I love you."
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.000]   There are a handful of defining moments, defining firsts,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.300]   that take place in every dating relationship,
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.100]   but for Brooke and I, there was one moment that surpassed them all,
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.300]   that stood out above the rest.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.000]   You know what it was?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.500]   It was the very first time I met her dad.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.700]   Brooke and I had been dating about a month or so,
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.000]   when I received a text message from her father,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.300]   asking me to meet so that I could clarify my intentions for his daughter,
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.900]   which is a very fair thing for a father to ask,
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.700]   and yet it still sent a very sensible chill down my spine,
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.100]   and so I respond very promptly and say, "Yes, I'd be happy to meet.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.700]   Where would you like to go?"
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.200]   And he responds with no words whatsoever, just an address,
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.000]   a Starbucks that was local to the area that we were supposed to meet,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.400]   which I assumed was the location of my pending doom.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.600]   Now, there are a few reasons I'll never forget meeting Brooke's dad for the very first time.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.800]   Firstly, at this time, I didn't have much experience drinking coffee.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.900]   Today, I know my way around the coffee shop,
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.600]   and yet at the time, I knew nothing about the stuff.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.400]   And so I ordered the only thing that I thought was right in a place like Starbucks.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.900]   I ordered a cappuccino,
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.900]   which is a horrible decision when the guy only drinks coffee hot and black.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.900]   Like, that's the way he likes it. Cappuccinos don't jive with him whatsoever.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.800]   Secondly, I remember this moment so distinctly
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.900]   because I didn't want there to be a lull in the conversation.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.100]   Like, I didn't want there to be any awkwardness whatsoever,
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.700]   no silence could take place.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.000]   And so I just nervously kept talking the entire time
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.100]   and told him everything that I wanted to do.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.200]   After I got out of college, I graduated in the spring,
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.300]   and I moved into the rest of my life,
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.900]   and I began to start my career and figure out what it looked like to be a young adult in the world,
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:01.400]   which just confirmed to him the fact that I was a senior dating his freshman daughter.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.200]   And lastly, and most notably of all,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.300]   I remember that moment so well because it went incredibly well.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.300]   Like, even though it felt like we got off to a rocky start,
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.100]   and I wasn't sure how things were going to end,
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.400]   over the course of our time together, I got to share my intentions for his daughter.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.900]   He got to clarify his expectations.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.700]   We got to remove all confusion in that conversation.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.500]   It changed the course of mine and Brooke's relationship forever.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.700]   Now, why do I tell you that? Because in the same way,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.800]   as we enter into a relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.000]   he wants to have an equally defining moment with us.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.800]   He wants to come to us and clarify all the intentions about what's going to happen in our relationship.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.400]   He wants to set all the expectations of what should be true between the two of us,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.300]   and he wants to remove any confusion whatsoever.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.700]   Jesus wants to make sure we know how we are supposed to relate to him.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:12.600]   And the way that we're supposed to relate to Jesus is we're meant to relate to him as disciples.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.100]   We're meant to relate to him as disciples, which may, for some of us in the room, feel surprising.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.900]   Like, we know that Jesus came to save us from our sins,
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.500]   that we were the problem that he came to fix,
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.500]   that we were the issue he came to resolve, we were the addicts he came to rehabilitate,
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.800]   we're the head case that he came to calm down.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.000]   And yet Jesus didn't just show up to save you from your sins.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.300]   No, no, no. He wants so much more for you.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.600]   Instead, Jesus doesn't just see you in light of your problems.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.300]   He sees you in light of your potential.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.500]   He sees you in light of your potential. Like, he doesn't just want to clean you up and then kick you out.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.800]   He wants to form you and mold you and grow you and shape you and develop you,
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.000]   which is what we all want. Like, fascinatingly,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.400]   if you go and you look at the trends that we as young adults have set,
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.000]   as we've told the watching workforce what we want to be true of our office spaces,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.600]   what we have said is we want good coaches more than we want good bosses.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.700]   Like, we want big purpose more than a big paycheck.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.800]   We want to be cultivated as individuals more than complemented as individuals.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.000]   What we have told the world, the young adults of our generation,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.500]   what we have said is what the Bible's been saying all along.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.000]   We want to be discipled. We want to be discipled.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.200]   We want to be formed. We want to be shaped. We want to be grown.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.600]   We want to be matured in some respect.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   And yet here's the thing you need to know before you can be discipled.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.200]   You've got to meet the discipler. And the place that we meet him is in Luke chapter 5.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.100]   So if you have a Bible, you can turn there with me.
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.900]   Gabe just read it to us and we're going to work our way through it.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.100]   But as you're turning in, let me just put my cards on the table
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:00.200]   and share with you why we are doing this series.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.500]   We're doing this series because I am convinced that far too many of us have settled
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:14.900]   for lives of knowing about Jesus and not actually knowing Jesus.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.500]   Like we think we got him figured out. Like we know what he brings to the table.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.400]   We've got our Christian friends. We've seen the principles that guide, guard their lives.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.000]   And yet what we know is that he's worth giving part of my life to,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.100]   but I don't know that I want to give him my full life.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.900]   And yet here's what I would argue. And here's why we're doing this series.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:40.600]   If you don't give Jesus your full life, then you are costing yourself the fullness of life.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.900]   It's by following wholeheartedly that we not only become what we want to be,
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.300]   but we become more than we ever thought we would be.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:55.200]   Because we become like him. That's what it means to be discipled.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.800]   And that's why over the course of this series,
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:03.600]   I want to do with you what I always do in any discipleship group that I lead.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.200]   I just want to study a handful of snapshots through the Gospels,
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.800]   and I want us to see the real Jesus from the eyes of the men that knew him best.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.900]   I want to put us from the same vantage of the disciples themselves.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.800]   I want us to see what they saw and hear what they heard and walk in their shoes
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.600]   and go wherever they went as they followed after Jesus.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.100]   Because I believe as we see them follow Jesus, not just an idea of Jesus,
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.900]   not just some concept of Jesus,
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.700]   but the real true Jesus Christ as we see them follow him,
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:49.900]   I think, and may I know, that we will learn what it means to follow him ourselves.
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:57.300]   So we've got to start where they started. Luke 5, we'll pick it up in verse 1.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.500]   "On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God,
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.000]   he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, and he saw two boats by the lake,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.700]   but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.900]   Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's,
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.800]   he asked him to put out a little from the land,
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.500]   and he sat down and he taught the people from the boat."
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.900]   Okay, so we just need to set the scene
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.900]   because we're catching up to Jesus' mid-ministry at this point.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.100]   Like he has already begun his public ministry,
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.000]   and what we know is that word has spread about this young traveling prophet,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.400]   this young teaching rabbi, and everybody wants a piece of this guy.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.200]   Like they've seen the miracles he's performed,
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.600]   and they have heard the authority with which he teaches,
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.500]   and everybody wants to get a piece of him.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.300]   Like he's the big-time star that rolls into the small-town square,
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.700]   and everybody can't get close enough. Like they all want a picture with Jesus.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.700]   They all want to get an autograph from the guy.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.300]   And so he, feeling all the pressure as people are gathering around him,
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.100]   is looking for a way to just get some breathing room.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:02.500]   And stage left, minding their own business, are four guys.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.800]   Simon Peter, Andrew James, and John.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.100]   And what you see is these guys are mending their nets.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.200]   They're cleaning their nets. Like they're untangling debris,
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.800]   and they're tying new knots, and they're repairing rips
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.900]   because they had just fished the night before.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.200]   And now that it's daytime, they're preparing to go out and fish again
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:27.800]   whenever evening comes. And yet into Peter's world and his boat steps Jesus.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.700]   Jesus hops into Peter's boat.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.800]   He needs to get some breathing room from the crowds around him.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.900]   And so he asks Peter, "Hey, can you just like push off from land a little bit?
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.200]   I need to take this boat for a minute,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.000]   and I need to turn this thing into my pulpit."
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And so Peter just casually obliges, which may feel crazy to us,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.600]   and yet you would do the same thing.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.700]   If Jesus hopped into your boat, not knowing anything about the guy,
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.900]   you would realize there's probably something worth knowing about the guy
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:55.700]   because all of these people are clamoring to get as close to him as possible.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:01.500]   And so what we see is that in verse 4, once he had finished speaking,
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:08.900]   he said to Simon, turning his attention from the crowds and to Peter himself,
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:14.300]   he says, "Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch."
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:21.600]   And Simon answered, "Master, we toiled all night. We took nothing.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.800]   But at your word, I'll let down the nets."
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.500]   So the first thing we got to learn about discipleship from Jesus
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.100]   is that Jesus turns failures into followers.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.100]   That's the first thing we've got to know.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.100]   As we consider this idea of discipleship,
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.100]   becoming a disciple, learning from the eyes of the disciples themselves,
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.900]   we need to know that Jesus turns failures into followers.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:49.500]   He's like the team captain that does not choose the best of the best to play on his team.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.600]   Instead, he chooses the worst of the worst.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.500]   The reason why is he knows that he's strong enough to carry the squad.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.900]   Like he doesn't look at Peter on the heels of a triple-double and think,
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.700]   "Man, that was a new personal best. Like I've got to get you onto my team."
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.100]   That's not what he thinks. He sees that Peter just went 0 for 12
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.300]   and had six turnovers the night before.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:13.400]   Peter is anything but suitable to be on Jesus' squad.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.300]   And yet Jesus chooses him anyways.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.100]   Jesus wants failures. He wants to turn them into followers.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:27.500]   Now, the reason we know he failed is because they fished all night long and they caught nothing.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.500]   Which I don't know about you, but when I read that, that didn't actually feel too crazy.
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.900]   Whenever I go fish, I'm not super successful at it.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.300]   And so the thought of fishing all night long does not seem like so much of a stretch.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.100]   And yet what we need to remember is that these men,
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.500]   these four guys that were introduced to in this story,
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:48.500]   and Peter specifically in this moment, they are fishermen by trade.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.300]   Like they were working professionals, experts in this subject area.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.900]   They had grown up learning all the tools of the trade.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.400]   Like this was their family business.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:07.900]   And so they are absolutely those which should be regarded within this realm far more than anybody else.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.800]   They know more about the topic than the rest.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.700]   That's why they fished at night. On the Sea of Galilee, fishermen would go out in the evenings
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.100]   and using one of three different methods of catching,
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.800]   what they would do is they would try to trap fish in shallow waters
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.700]   because schools of fish would swim to the shoreline where they would feed on minnows
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.000]   and smaller fish in the warmer, shallower waters.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.200]   They would do so in the evening because there wasn't much foot traffic.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.100]   And yet despite having all the tools and all the training and all the technique,
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:43.900]   what we see is that Peter has nothing to show for it.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:51.500]   He's a failure. And he has no excuse to be.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.400]   Which is probably a feeling many of us understand.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:04.300]   Like many of us, we keep falling short, even though we know better.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.700]   Like we have the right knowledge. We have the proper tools.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.400]   We've installed covenant eyes. We've assembled good accountability.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   And yet what we find is we continue to fall into the swarm of sin that we have carried with us for so very long.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   We know better. And yet we continue to fail again and again and again.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   And it feels like we're the only ones. Like nobody else is struggling with a porn addiction.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:40.100]   Everyone else has moved past that by this point. Or nobody else is struggling with making an impact in the world.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.700]   They've all gone and done it. And yet I'm still stuck here striving to do it.
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.900]   Everyone else is already making six figures, but I can't get there.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.100]   I've tried. I've angled. I've applied. And none of it's worked.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.700]   Everyone has moved on from their past hurts, but I can't seem to do it.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.300]   I can't bring myself to go. It's too difficult.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.200]   I'm too identified with that thing which happened to me at some point in the past.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.400]   We feel like what Paul describes in Romans chapter 7.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:11.500]   "For I know that nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:18.800]   For I have the desire to do what's right. I just don't have the ability to carry it out.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.800]   For I do not do the good that I want, but the evil I don't want is what I keep on doing.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.900]   Now if I do what I do not want, it's no longer I who do it, but it's sin that dwells in me."
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:37.200]   Like we're left not mending our nets like these four guys,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:43.100]   but we are left licking our wounds, wondering, though I know so much better,
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.200]   why is it that I keep falling prey to the same sin over and over?
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.700]   Why do I keep struggling and falling short?
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:56.800]   When is it going to feel as if I'm no longer a failure, but I'm actually a success?
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.100]   Why is it that I never seem to win? I only seem to lose,
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:08.100]   and I continually, perpetually find myself at rock bottom?
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.100]   If that's you, then you need to listen.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:18.200]   Jesus in this story, he doesn't wait for these boys to come to him on their own time.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:24.500]   He comes to them on his own time. Like he doesn't wait for Peter to have a good night.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:30.300]   No, he actually shows up after Peter's worst night, after a colossal failure,
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.200]   which is just encouraging to us because Jesus doesn't need you to clean yourself up.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.900]   He doesn't need you to make yourself right.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.800]   He doesn't need you to be 30 days sober before you come up to him.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.700]   He doesn't need you to go a month without masturbation before you come to him.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.500]   He doesn't need you to make claim to all the compromise that you've done
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.500]   and come clean before everyone in your community before you come to him.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.600]   He will take you how you are, wherever it is you are.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:01.200]   He wants you exactly as you are here tonight.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:08.100]   He doesn't need you to shape up. He just needs you to come to the shore.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.800]   You see, Jesus, he turns failures into followers,
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   but here's the catch that we learned from this passage.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.900]   He's going to test if we'll actually follow him. Like that's what we see he does with Peter.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.900]   Like he wants to do something great in Peter's life.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.400]   And yet he's going to put Peter through a couple of small tests,
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.600]   all of which revolve around something Peter knows exceedingly well.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.500]   All revolve around fishing. He looks at Peter and he's like,
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.400]   "Hey man, can we put out? Can we go deep? Will you drop the nets?"
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.300]   And Peter has no reason to do it. Like Peter is the fisherman.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.800]   Jesus, you're the carpenter. Peter could pull rank and just say,
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.200]   "This is nuts. It's insensible. Why would we do it?"
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:54.700]   And yet what we see is that Peter takes small steps of obedience.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:19:03.500]   He makes small moves of willingness. Even though this is wildly unreasonable.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.200]   It doesn't make any sense that Jesus would ask him to do this.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.300]   Like number one, this is the wrong time of day to fish. It's daytime.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.600]   It's not night, Jesus. This is a horrible idea.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.800]   And not only is it the wrong time of day, it's the wrong kind of water.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.900]   We're in the wrong place. We should be in the shallows,
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.700]   but you're taking us to the depths. Why are we in the deep water?
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.500]   This is not where we cast nets, Jesus. It doesn't make any sense.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:27.300]   It's totally unreasonable. And yet here is the thing.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:33.400]   Miracles seldom happen in the realm of reason.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.500]   Miracles seldom happen in the realm of reason.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.900]   Jesus is taking Peter into an unreasonable place
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:46.000]   because he wants to do something unreasonable in Peter's life.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.600]   All Peter has to do is take steps of faith.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.300]   Now, steps of faith are never easy. Steps of faith are always hard.
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.900]   The path of least resistance is never the path of greatest faith.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.800]   And yet what you know is that as Peter takes these steps,
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   as he makes these moves, he does so with a skeptical yes.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.100]   But Jesus can do so much more with a skeptical yes than an arrogant no.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.400]   He'll take you with your doubts. You can feel some sense of confusion.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:20.600]   He can work with that. He just needs you to row out a little bit deeper.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.200]   It says in verse 6, "And when they had done this,
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.600]   they enclosed a large number of fish and their nets were breaking.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.300]   They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.200]   And they came and they filled both boats so that both boats began to sink."
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.500]   Like Peter takes three small steps of faith
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.200]   and Jesus delivers three massive moves of God.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.800]   They enclosed a large number of fish,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.700]   their nets began to break, and both boats began to sink,
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.600]   which is just the most ridiculous contrast.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:52.400]   Like just think about it. We just read that a team of four men,
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.000]   highly trained professionals, working all night long, could catch nothing.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.400]   And yet one man with some haphazard indifference drops the net
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.900]   and encloses the catch of the century.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:10.500]   What was the difference? Jesus was with one of them.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.700]   While he was not with the other four. Jesus makes the difference.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.500]   That's what he wants us to see here.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.000]   Jesus is going to move in ways we don't expect through people
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.300]   we wouldn't expect to prove he is far more than we ever expected.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.900]   So several years ago, I was skiing in Colorado
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.800]   and I was riding up a chairlift and I was by myself.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.400]   So I was riding alongside one other single, a random guy.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.100]   And as is common courtesy, whenever you're riding up the chairlift,
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.800]   we're just making a small talk, easygoing conversation,
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.700]   asking where he's from. Hey man, where, you know, how long you here for?
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.500]   Oh cool. Has it been a good trip? Like we're just making conversation.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.100]   And yet he looks at me and he goes, hey man, you want to see a trick?
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.500]   Sure. It's kind of weird thing. Just you and I up here, but why not?
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   And so he takes a piece of his sandwich and he hands me a morsel of bread
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:03.200]   and he says, hey, just throw it over the chairlift right there.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.000]   And so I take the bread and I throw it over the chairlift
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.600]   and out of the trees flies a bird and catches it in mid-flight.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.100]   He goes, I'll do you one better. Try this one.
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.200]   He takes it and he has me place it on, not throw it over the rail,
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   but put it on the armrest itself of the chairlift.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.400]   And as I do, another bird swoops in from a tree and lands on the rail
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.900]   and grabs the piece of sandwich and flies off into the unknown.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.400]   And for his final act, as I'm sitting there in disbelief,
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.500]   he takes another piece of a sandwich, but rather than handing it to me,
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:41.200]   he holds it out over the edge of the chairlift and not a bird,
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:50.100]   but a hawk flies in, land on his arm and begins to eat the sandwich from his hand.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.600]   A few things stood out to me in this moment. Number one,
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.300]   that must have been a really good sandwich.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:05.300]   And number two, clearly there's something different about this guy,
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.100]   which is exactly how Peter feels in this moment.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.800]   Like Jesus has just done something so unexpected to prove that he is far more
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:19.100]   than Peter expected and it changes everything for him. It freaks him out.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.300]   It says in verse 8, "But when Simon Peter saw it,
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:26.600]   he fell down at Jesus' knees saying, 'Depart from me, for I'm a sinful man, O Lord.'
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.700]   For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken.
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.600]   And so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon."
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.000]   Like Peter, because of this interaction with Jesus,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.700]   gets an entirely new outlook on life, which we need to adopt ourself
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.900]   because you can't reach your potential until you receive a new perspective.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:54.700]   You cannot reach your potential until you receive a new perspective.
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.300]   It's interesting the way Luke writes this account,
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.200]   because the minute Jesus shows up and he proves to Peter,
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.600]   "Hey, I'm actually so much more than you think I am.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:08.500]   I'm not just a teacher. I'm God." Everything shifts for that brother.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.800]   Like he changes his name in a blip. He goes from Simon to Peter.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.700]   He stops calling Jesus "Master" and starts calling Jesus "Lord."
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.000]   And what you find is his entire perspective shifts.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.900]   He's no longer a skillful fisherman.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.400]   He's a sinful passenger and it's not his boat anymore.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:33.100]   It's Jesus'. You see, that's what it means when it says that he was astonished.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.200]   The Greek there for the word astonished is the word thambos.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.800]   And what that word means is it's an emotional reaction,
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.400]   pairing both fear and awe in one experience.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.300]   It's the way you feel whenever you stand at the height of a skyscraper
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.200]   and you look over the edge, like your heart kind of jumps up into your throat,
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.900]   you know, like you're horrified by the height of where you are
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.000]   and yet you are mesmerized by the view from up there.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.500]   That's exactly what Peter is feeling in this moment.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:09.600]   Like Peter sees Jesus as Jesus is. He notices that Jesus is God in flesh.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.700]   And when he sees Jesus for who he is, as he just pulls back the veil
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.100]   and he gives him just the smallest of glimpses as to who he is,
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:22.200]   he sees that Jesus is terrifyingly wonderful.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.900]   Terrifyingly wonderful. Wonderful because he is God.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:32.300]   And yet terrifying because if he can see into the depth of the sea,
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.500]   then I know he can see into the depth of my soul.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.700]   And he won't like what he finds there.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.500]   And some of us can relate to that feeling so much.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.800]   Like we know it's true in our heart of hearts
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.400]   and we're not proud of what's found there either.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.200]   Like we know deep down the envy we have, the hate we hold,
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.500]   or the anger we harbor, or the jealousy we carry,
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.900]   or the bitterness we bear, or the lusts that we crave.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.800]   And we know it's not acceptable.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.200]   We know it's ugly and cowardly and horrible.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.100]   And so what we want is to conceal it from people.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.500]   We don't want Jesus to see it and we don't want others to see it.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.800]   And so we hide that part of our heart from the watching world.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.400]   We hide it. We conceal it. We act like everything's okay.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.300]   We put up a nice front. We make sure that we only sin in secret.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.900]   We always run from the truth.
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.500]   And yet Jesus doesn't want that for Peter.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.900]   And he doesn't want that for you.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.600]   Like though Peter is so afraid of what's happening in me, God,
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.200]   and if you see this, you won't want anything to do with me.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.400]   Jesus does not reject Peter. He reaches for him. He grabs him.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.100]   That's what it says in verse 10.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:55.200]   It says, "And Jesus said to Simon, 'Don't be afraid.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.500]   From now on, you'll be catching men.'"
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.300]   Like Jesus looked at him and he says, "Hey, I've got plans for you.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.700]   I've got a future for you.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:08.100]   I've got a destiny for you the likes of which you wouldn't dream.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:14.200]   But before we can get there, before I can unleash all of your potential,
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   I've got to unlock your perspective. Not just your perspective on who I am,
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:24.500]   that I am God, but your perspective on who you are,
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.600]   that I've come to get you. That you're no longer a slave to sin.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.900]   You're a child of mine. You're a part of my family.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:37.300]   That I'm the one that went to the cross to endure all the consequence of your sin
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.100]   and shame and you, because you placed your faith in me,
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.300]   now you get all the reward of walking with me in relationship.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.700]   That's what Galatians 2:20 tells us.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.900]   It tells us about a new perspective that we've been crucified with Christ.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.200]   It's no longer I who live, but it's Christ who lives in me.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.000]   In the life I now live in the flesh,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.700]   I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.500]   You see, for those that are in Christ, it's no longer you who live.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.000]   It's Christ who lives in you.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And because your life is now his life, you live the way he wants to live.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.900]   And the way Jesus wants to live is he wants to live for what matters most.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.000]   He wants to live for people. He wants to live for people.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.600]   That's what it means whenever he says,
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.100]   "Hey, I'll make you into a fisher of men." The Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of Mark,
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.600]   he says, "Follow me. I'll make you into a fisher of men."
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.300]   He doesn't look at Peter and say, "Follow me and I will make you happy."
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.000]   He doesn't look at Peter and say, "Follow me and I will make you successful.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.400]   I will make you popular. I will make you healthy."
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:47.800]   He doesn't say any of those things because none of those things matter as much as people.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   People matter the most. Why? Because people go on forever.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:59.500]   The souls of every person in this room, they will not end.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:06.300]   They will go one of two places. And Jesus is challenging Peter to consider,
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:12.000]   "Hey, what will you give up that you might lean into all of the significance that I have for you?"
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   I've got a life that I want you to live, Peter.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.300]   Something that really matters, that does not fade, that goes on forever.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.600]   And the truth of the matter is, poor, it's like, can we just level with each other?
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.600]   We want that. Don't you? Don't you want a life of significance and meaning and purpose
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.200]   and lasting impact that makes a difference in the world?
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.800]   Don't you want that for yourself?
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:41.200]   Like, does anybody in here just want to kind of roll through life in mundaneity and in meaninglessness?
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.400]   No, we all want to matter. We all want to make a difference.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.300]   I'm so fired up about it because I know it's true.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:54.200]   And Jesus is saying, "That's the kind of life I've come to give you."
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.800]   And yet, you know what the irony is?
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:04.000]   We all want a life that matters. And yet so often, too frequently,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.600]   we live lives for things that don't matter at all.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:18.500]   We want so badly to be successful, to reach the heights of some pinnacle where everyone knows about us,
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.400]   though in a hundred years, no one will know about us.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.600]   We want so badly to get that body to look this way.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.300]   And yet what we find is that in time, no matter how hard we try,
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.800]   no matter how much plastic we put on, we're just going to grow old.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   We're just going to wear away. Like we want so badly to make more money.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.800]   And yet all the things we buy, though they start with shine,
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:48.000]   eventually wear away and fade as the days grow long.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.600]   We want that job. And yet here's the thing that's crazy.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.300]   We're going to get that job and we're going to love that work.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:59.000]   And yet when we retire, they're just going to backfill your position.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.300]   No one will ever speak your name. Someone will actually do it better than you ever did.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:10.200]   Like some of us, we want popularity. Like we want the world to look at us and know us and love us.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:17.900]   And yet no one, though they may see you, actually knows you or actually loves you.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:23.500]   So many of us are investing in things that do not matter,
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.300]   that don't go the distance, that will fade in time.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:32.300]   And yet Jesus is standing here and he's looking at us and he's saying,
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:37.900]   I want something different for you. I want something better for you.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.500]   Like I've got the kind of life you wouldn't believe.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:47.400]   But here's the thing, before you can step into this life that matters,
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.900]   you've got to leave the life that doesn't matter.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:32:00.400]   You've got to drop your nets. That's exactly what Peter, James, John, and Andrew do.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.900]   We see in verse 11, "And when they had brought their boats to land,
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:11.000]   they left everything and they followed him."
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.200]   So let's just play a hypothetical scenario in here.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:22.100]   Say Taylor Swift or Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson or Justin Bieber or Jimmy Fallon or Blake Lively
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:27.400]   or your celebrity of choice comes to you and says,
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:36.000]   "Hey, I noticed you. I want you to come and follow me for the next year.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.200]   You're going to have unprecedented access to me.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.700]   Like you're going to get to go to the places I go and meet the people I meet
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.900]   and see the things I see and do the things I do.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.300]   You're going to get to be a part of all of it.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.700]   Sure, you're going to have to let some things go,
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.100]   but you're going to get so much more if you come."
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.100]   What's your response to that offer?
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.700]   When are we leaving? Tomorrow? I can pack tonight. I can get there.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.200]   I'll make my way. I'll get an Uber. Like no, we all want to go.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.800]   Like barring we have no outstanding circumstances, we want to be there.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.700]   We want to go there. We want to hop in and ride off into the sunset
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.300]   with whoever our person of significance is.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.600]   Like we want that sort of opportunity porch.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.200]   Someone so much more significant has offered it to you.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.900]   Jesus is looking at you and saying, "Follow me, not just for the next year,
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.800]   but for the rest of your life." Well, Jesus, what have you been a part of?
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.600]   I'm the son of God. I created the cosmos.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.000]   I hold everything together. That's pretty good.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.600]   You know, like that's someone that we should go with.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.400]   That's someone we should hop in for.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:53.300]   Jesus is looking at us and saying, "I will make you into something you wouldn't believe.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:59.000]   I will lead you someplace you would never dream.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.400]   But friend, you've got to follow me."
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.700]   Which tells us the last thing we need to know about discipleship.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:14.100]   Nothing is worth keeping if it keeps us from Jesus.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:19.300]   Nothing in the world is worth keeping if it keeps us from Jesus.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:28.200]   And yet here's the thing, as I wrote that point into my notes, I just knew.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:36.700]   As I say it to the crowd tonight and you hear that command.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.300]   Some of you are going to be on the fence even still.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.700]   Like even though the offer's been made, even though the invitation's been set,
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.600]   you're going to hear the opportunity at hand and you're going to say,
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:55.300]   "Man, that sounds nice." But isn't that offer always available?
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.400]   Like this isn't really a limited time thing.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:04.500]   Like this isn't an invitation that actually expires.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.400]   Like sure, I want to commit my life to following Jesus.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.100]   Like there's going to come a day where I want to settle down
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.100]   and I want to have a wife or a husband and have some kids
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.000]   and raise a family and live in that neighborhood and plant some roots
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.400]   and be a contributor to the community.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.800]   Like I want all of that stuff, but here's the thing, like I'm still in the prime of life.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.300]   I'm still young and attractive and ambitious and adventurous.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.700]   And I've got things that I want to do and places I want to go and people I want to see
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:30.500]   and joy I want to find. Like I've got a life right now that I want to live
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.000]   and I don't know that Jesus is going to give me the sort of tools
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   and guide and guard that's going to lead me into that sort of reality.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.300]   I want that. I just don't want that right now.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.000]   Friend, let me just tell you,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.500]   if that's your response to the invitation that Jesus is putting in front of you,
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.800]   you're not costing Jesus anything by making him wait.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:01.500]   But you are costing yourself everything at the same time.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:07.700]   Like Jesus wants more for you than you want yourself.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:12.300]   That's why he wants you to follow him. Today, tonight, right here in this moment,
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.800]   he wants you to come with him, not because he needs anything from you.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.400]   I need you to tell me I'm awesome.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.800]   No, he wants everything for you.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.900]   That's his heart. And he's standing here this evening,
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:29.900]   not on the shore of Galilee, but on a stage in Dallas, Texas,
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.700]   simply saying, hey, come and follow me.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.700]   I've got a life for you the likes of which you wouldn't dream.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.300]   You couldn't cook up something better than I've got for you.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.500]   Sure. It may be hard in this trouble, in this world, you will have trouble,
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.000]   but take heart. I've overcome the world and guess what? I'm with you.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Let's go together. I've got something significant for you.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   And Porch, I'm praying. God, I am praying.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   We don't miss the offer while it still stands.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.100]   I am praying you don't waste your life
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:16.800]   trying to figure out everything I'm saying is actually true.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.600]   These men dropped everything to follow Jesus.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:26.100]   More than the development that he promised or the destiny he could give.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:34.300]   They saw the delight that he offered as a God come to them.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.400]   You see, yes, Jesus wants to develop you.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.500]   Yes, Jesus has a destiny for you,
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:47.500]   but he is on his own eternally so sufficiently delightful.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.900]   Like the life and the hope and the peace and the friendship
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.000]   and the joy that you long for in life.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.700]   It's found in him, not found anywhere else.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.600]   Sure, the world will offer and promise,
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.800]   but it will always under deliver in this way.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.700]   Yet Jesus, he will deliver again and again and again.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:15.400]   And yet here's the thing, though this delight stands ready for us tonight.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:21.400]   We've got to drop our nets.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:28.500]   Like whatever your safety net is, you got to let it down.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.900]   You can't run forward while still holding back.
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.900]   You've got to drop whatever it is you're carrying.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.200]   For some of us, that means you've got to drop the shame that you feel.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.300]   You've got to drop the shame you have for that thing you did,
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.500]   that thing you said, that person you heard, that place you went.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:50.400]   You've got to drop that shame. And I've heard some of the shame that you carry.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.900]   And I know it feels like God, I can't let this go so easily.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:59.500]   This defines me now. No, that shame does not define you.
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:05.500]   For that shame was left in the grave once Jesus rose forth from it.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.400]   So you drop it and you leave it where he left it himself.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   Others of you, you need to drop your anger.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.800]   Someone did you wrong. Someone hurt you bad.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   Someone took something from you that they had no business taking.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.900]   And yet Jesus, if you will only drop that anger,
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.500]   will give to you joy like you would not know elsewhere.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.000]   Some of you need to drop envy.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.600]   You need to let go all the bitterness you hold with other people
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.500]   because they have the things that you want.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:41.600]   And you've tried not just as hard, but even harder than they have to get where they are.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:45.100]   And yet you need to drop the fact that you think you deserve that
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.000]   and you need to trust Jesus instead that he will take you where it is.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.700]   Not just you want to go, he wants you to go in his own time.
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.100]   Some of you need to drop your relationship.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.100]   Though you love that person and they have some redeeming qualities,
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.600]   you know that the two of you together are not godly
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.300]   and the two of you towards one another are not good.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.900]   It's toxic. And it's time to drop it and let it go.
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:13.600]   Others of you need to drop your addiction.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   Look, I'm not too naive to know that there are people in here that wrestle with pornography,
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.700]   that wrestle with alcohol, that wrestle with marijuana,
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:29.300]   that wrestle with scrolling, that wrestle with whatever because you're coping.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:33.500]   Listen, man, I don't blame you. I've been there.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.400]   I'm not looking at you saying you're crazy.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:41.900]   But I am looking at you and saying, he's better.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.100]   He can give you whatever you think that thing can.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:52.200]   He can satisfy you not just as much but so much more than any bottle,
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:58.400]   than any screen, than any pill. You're coping because you want joy.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.200]   You want to feel something real, something good.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   It's here tonight. And he never runs out.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.700]   He never runs empty. Some of you need to drop your control.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:18.300]   Your need to like make things happen the way you want. To get there whenever it is you want.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:23.900]   To arrive on your own schedule like you need to drop that.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:34.500]   And you need to trust. That though you may feel insecure circumstantially,
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:40.200]   you are totally secure spiritually. He's got you.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:46.000]   He's not going to let you go. Some of us need to drop the image that you're so desperate to keep.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.500]   Man, I've spent too much time around the church and around church people.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.700]   To know that so many of us pride ourselves on looking a certain way.
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:01.100]   On retaining that kind of reputation. On having that sort of character.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:09.700]   And we are fearful that anything would ever happen to hurt the image we have worked so hard to build.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:13.400]   So desperate to keep it, are we, that we would conceal our sin.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:19.400]   We would hide our shame. We would stiff arm people and keep them at bay.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:25.300]   Because we, we want to look a certain way, be perceived a certain way, received a certain way.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.600]   You got to drop that. Because it's only robbing you of life.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.500]   Some of you need to drop the future you're so desperate to find.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:39.400]   Because Jesus has a better future for you.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:48.200]   You know, the question as we think about Jesus is not what one pastor said.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:57.400]   Do I want heaven over hell? The question Jesus is putting before you is, do you want heaven over earth?
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.900]   Like, do you want heaven? Do you want Jesus? Do you want eternity?
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:05.900]   Do you want everlasting life and all the joy and satisfaction that's found therein?
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:15.400]   Or do you just want the things of this world? Those things which, and they feel good for a moment.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:21.500]   But they do not last. They will in fact fade. And they will run dry.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.700]   Jesus is sitting here tonight and he's looking at you and saying, drop it all.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.400]   Leave it here. Don't take it out into the city with you.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:34.200]   Leave it tonight. Because I came to turn failures into followers.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.500]   So much so that I gave my life to save you.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:42.000]   I came to unlock all of your potential. And that comes by way of new perspective.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   That perspective is found not just in the death I died,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.700]   but the resurrection I rose so that as I rise to heaven and I sit next to the Father,
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.200]   you can rise alongside me. If only you place your faith in me.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.400]   There's potential in you. I see it. You can be like me.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:01.600]   Just place your faith and let's go. Let's move forward.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.800]   He wants you to know man, nothing is worth keeping if it keeps you from me.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:12.200]   Because I was willing to give everything to get to you.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:18.700]   Porch, won't you drop everything and follow him? Because he dropped everything to find you.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.600]   Let me pray for us. Father, we love you.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.700]   I'm grateful for an evening like this.
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.900]   Thankful for your word and the sufficiency of it.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:30.100]   And the fact that God, it speaks to a wide array of people.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:34.200]   So many, so many stories, so many histories,
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.500]   so many situations and circumstances all across this room.
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:45.600]   And the truth of your word applies to all of us. God, I beg you.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.400]   Would you work in this next moment? Would you stir in our souls?
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:57.400]   Would you lead us to a place of radical response?
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.700]   Where we've heard the gospel, we have seen the invitation,
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:06.300]   and now God, I pray we would reach out with arms extended to take the invite from you,
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:13.200]   to receive the offer you've given, to accept the gift you give by placing our faith in you.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.400]   We love you. And it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
