 Another weekend, I'm just living my life.

00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,480
 I tell myself that it's fine.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,840
 Why do I wake up with this feeling inside?

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,800
 Is it OK?

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,680
 Or is it time to change?

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,360
 Am I OK?

 Is it shame that I feel?

 I think I'm happy, but don't know if it's real.

 And I pretend that it's all chill.

 Wherever you're listening, we are glad that you're here.

72
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,080
 I'm going to start us off with a story

73
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280
 as we continue this series, Vice and Virtue.

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,160
 A few months ago, my wife and I had our five-year anniversary.

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,360
 And-- let me move this.

76
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,160
 Thank you.

77
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,360
 And we went to-- we decided we were

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,760
 going to go to New York in the wintertime.

79
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,160
 We were going to go see the tree and see the lighting.

80
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,000
 Yeah, thank you, man.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,420
 This is such an encouraging crowd.

82
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,000
 I'll keep going.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
 And we planned it all out.

84
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
 And we were only going to be there for four days.

85
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,040
 So we had never really spent time together in New York.

86
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,160
 And as you know, if you've been there,

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,720
 there's more than enough to do for four days' worth.

88
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,160
 And so if you're going to really max out your experience,

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,400
 you've got to plan things out.

90
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,760
 You've got to look into things, make reservations.

91
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,840
 You need to-- especially if you're

92
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,720
 trying to work on a budget, because everything in New York

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,040
 is like a billion dollars.

94
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,520
 If you're listening from New York, can we work on that?

95
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,480
 So anyway, so we are looking into coupons.

96
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,800
 And this is where you've got to buy tickets for this show

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,520
 if you're going to be here.

98
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,320
 And if you want to see Hamilton on Broadway,

99
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,840
 you've got to go to like 18 different websites

100
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,560
 and type things in.

101
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,480
 Still didn't work.

102
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,800
 And we just went through all the different planning

103
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,640
 for that event so that when it came,

104
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,560
 we would max out those four days that we

105
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
 were going to have there.

106
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
 And so we asked friends for kind of their lists of, hey,

107
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,440
 this is for sure where you need to eat.

108
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,320
 This is for sure where you need to go.

109
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
 And we just had an amazing time.

110
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,040
 And we got to see the 9/11 Museum,

111
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,560
 got to go to Rockefeller Center, got to go to Central Park,

112
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,000
 do the bikes, got to go experience

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,880
 the joys that is the subway, which we tried

114
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,320
 to minimize our time on that.

115
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,160
 We got to just go all throughout the town and have the best

116
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,240
 or try to make the most of every single moment

117
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,280
 that we had on that trip.

118
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,040
 And the reason I start there is because the Bible presents

119
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,960
 this idea that your life and my life

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,240
 is like we're on this trip.

121
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,600
 And it tells us that inside of your life,

122
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,840
 you only have so many moments where

123
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,800
 you're going to get to use, you're going to get to live,

124
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,200
 you're going to get to experience.

125
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,280
 And so make sure that you are diligent to maximize

126
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,280
 your purposeful to put to use the moments

127
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,560
 that you're going to have.

128
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
 Just like we only had four days or a certain number of hours

129
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,600
 that you're going to be there, the Bible

130
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,440
 presents this idea that you and I only

131
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,000
 have a certain number of moments in this life.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,280
 And so we are to be very purposeful as it

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,280
 relates to how we use them.

134
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,880
 And the reason why that's relevant to this series of vice

135
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,320
 and virtue, OK, living with purpose and living on meaning

136
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,640
 and making the most of opportunities,

137
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,960
 what's it have to do with advice or virtue,

138
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,920
 is because tonight we're going to look

139
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,000
 at a passage of scripture where the apostle Paul

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,840
 in Ephesians chapter 5, if you have a Bible,

141
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,920
 you can flip open there.

142
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,520
 He says that this is a vice that will keep you

143
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,360
 from living a life of meaning.

144
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,820
 It's really the only one that we've looked at so far where

145
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,760
 Paul says, look, hey, as it relates to your life,

146
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,840
 here's how you should live.

147
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,240
 And as it relates to this particular vice,

148
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,640
 the vice of drunkenness, you need

149
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,440
 to be very, very careful that you do not

150
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,280
 allow this vice to take you off course

151
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,120
 and to lead you to live a life that is not just reckless.

152
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,480
 It is a life that's void of meaning.

153
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,840
 And so we're going to be in Ephesians chapter 5.

154
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,480
 Ephesians chapter 5, starting in verse 18.

155
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,680
 If you have a Bible, you can flip there.

156
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
 If not, it will be up on the screen.

157
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,160
 And we'll dive in.

158
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,480
 Let me just say this about alcohol in biblical times

159
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,840
 because there's a lot of misinformation out there

160
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,520
 and a lot of--

161
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,720
 it's just it was a different time and a different day.

162
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,080
 Alcohol in Paul's day was probably

163
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,560
 as prevalent, if not more prevalent,

164
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,880
 than it is even in our day.

165
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,080
 And why I say that is because at that time, really,

166
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,520
 we didn't totally understand or they

167
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,120
 didn't totally understand bacteria and the way

168
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,360
 that you boil water and you get rid of different things

169
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,120
 in order to get sick.

170
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,040
 So what they knew is, hey, if you drink water,

171
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,280
 you could get sick.

172
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,320
 It'd be essentially like if you're drinking water

173
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,360
 in a third world country.

174
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,840
 Same thing.

175
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,440
 They'd be like, man, if you drink water, you can get sick.

176
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,840
 Or if you drink wine, you get drunk.

177
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
 And I think I'm going to go with the second.

178
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,480
 And so they would just-- it was just a very common thing

179
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,800
 where, hey, if I'm going to have to risk it

180
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,560
 and roll the dice here, I'd rather risk it

181
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,800
 with the second than with the first.

182
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,840
 And so Paul writes to a culture that much like ours,

183
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,000
 celebrated, embraced, and had wine or had alcohol

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,760
 in a very prevalent way.

185
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,720
 And he says, as Christians in this life,

186
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
 here's how you and I are to relate to alcohol.

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,760
 So we're going to dive right in as we just

188
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,600
 explore what it looks like to interact

189
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,400
 with this vice of drunkenness.

190
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,360
 In this series, we've been covering biblical virtues

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,280
 and the corresponding cultural vices

192
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
 that exist in our world.

193
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,800
 So we'll pick it up in verse 15 of chapter 5.

194
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,280
 "Be very careful, then, how you live, not as unwise,

195
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,080
 but as wise, making the most of every opportunity,

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
 because the days are evil.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,480
 Therefore, do not be foolish."

198
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,840
 Or the same Greek word is the word stupid.

199
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,440
 So don't be stupid, but understand

200
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,400
 what the Lord's will is.

201
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,880
 So Paul says, look, hey, as it relates

202
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,920
 to how you're going to live your life--

203
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,320
 everybody listen up really here.

204
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,600
 The Greek word in be careful is emphatic.

205
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
 It's saying, hey, I want everyone's attention right

206
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
 here as it relates to how you're going to live your life,

207
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,840
 how you're going to spend your time, he would say to you

208
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,120
 and say to me, you need to be very, very careful that you

209
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,960
 don't allow just the current of culture--

210
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,280
 that's the days of evil--

211
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,480
 to sweep you away.

212
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,520
 And you don't allow other people in your life

213
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,560
 or the culture around you or the family you were raised in,

214
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
 you don't allow those things to dictate how you're

215
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,720
 going to use your life.

216
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,200
 Don't be stupid, he says, but know what God's will is,

217
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,160
 or know what God wants you to do inside of your life,

218
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,520
 and then do that.

219
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,040
 Know what God wants you to do in that job,

220
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,520
 know what he wants you to do in that relationship,

221
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,240
 know what he wants you to do at any given moment.

222
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,320
 Be someone who's attentive and listening and careful that,

223
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,840
 hey, in this moment right now, I want to be careful to do

224
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,920
 what God would have me do, what would he have me do,

225
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,760
 and then I want to do it.

226
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,000
 That's what Paul says, do that.

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,320
 Making the most of every opportunity, living for eternity.

228
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,160
 And then he takes a left turn that almost feels like,

229
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,560
 what, and he says this.

230
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,600
 Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery,

231
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,480
 which on the face, or on the surface, you're like,

232
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,360
 take it easy, Paul, feels like a little personal, buddy.

233
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,720
 I mean, it's just a couple, a couple,

234
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,840
 I mean, just a little tipsy, it was a couple drinks,

235
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,640
 that's my business, why don't you keep your own business,

236
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,640
 Paul, and yet there's a reason why he connects these ideas.

237
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,720
 It's very intentional that he brings up what he does next.

238
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,280
 So I just want to camp out on the first topic that we're

239
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,040
 going to talk about in these three ideas tonight,

240
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,160
 is living underneath the influence.

241
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,600
 Living underneath the influence, because I think what

242
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,560
 Paul does here is pretty brilliant,

243
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,400
 and it's very, very purposeful.

244
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,140
 There's a couple things that he tells us inside of this,

245
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,560
 where he says, man, live for eternity, live purposefully,

246
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,940
 cut back on the alcohol, and don't consume so much,

247
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,560
 because it's going to lead you somewhere very specific.

248
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,120
 And he tells us, it will lead you

249
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,960
 in the direction of debauchery.

250
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,360
 I think where we're immediately going to have a challenge

251
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,960
 is when Paul says, hey, don't get drunk on wine,

252
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,960
 I think that all of us would be like, dude, look, Paul,

253
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,920
 I'm not drunk, okay, it was a little buzzed,

254
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,520
 and it was my birthday, okay, so I deserved it.

255
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,840
 And all of us would just be like, it's not,

256
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,100
 I never get drunk, like drunk is the guy who's like,

257
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,720
 passed out and his friends had to carry him home,

258
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,680
 or he just ended up sleeping at the bar, wasn't drunk,

259
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,240
 and so what do you even mean by drunk?

260
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,560
 What does Paul mean by drunk?

261
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,080
 What does it mean to get drunk?

262
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,160
 Is it two drinks, three drinks, four?

263
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,400
 What is, is it what the T-A-B-C says is drunk?

264
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,280
 Is that what Paul had in mind when he wrote this?

265
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,280
 And I think Paul would say you're asking the wrong question.

266
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,280
 It's not about how much alcohol you have,

267
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,060
 it's about how much of you the alcohol has.

268
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,200
 It is not about how much you drink

269
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,600
 or how much alcohol you consume,

270
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
 it is about how much of you,

271
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,880
 how much of your control of your life

272
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,440
 the alcohol has over you.

273
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,520
 But just to give a little bit of clarity before we go on,

274
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,280
 'cause Paul's going, hey, don't get drunk on wine,

275
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,800
 which he would say in case you're like,

276
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,480
 I never drink wine, I'm a beer guy.

277
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,880
 He would say don't get drunk on beer,

278
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,240
 don't get drunk on shots of Patron,

279
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,760
 don't get drunk on anything.

280
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,960
 And if you're going, I don't know that I'm really drunk,

281
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,820
 here's just a couple context clues,

282
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,680
 maybe this will be helpful for you as it relates to drunk.

283
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,820
 If you wake up the next day with a hangover,

284
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,620
 you probably were drunk.

285
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,420
 I don't know if that would be controversial or not,

286
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,000
 I would think not, but save the email

287
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 'cause I probably won't respond.

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,520
 If you find yourself forgetting things

289
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,960
 about the night before, you probably were drunk.

290
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,760
 If you're like, man, I can't believe that I texted him this,

291
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,200
 the text is in Spanish, I don't even speak Spanish.

292
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
 (audience laughing)

293
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,360
 You probably had too much to drink.

294
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,220
 If you are unable to concentrate,

295
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,920
 or you're having to really, really concentrate

296
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,920
 when you talk, you're like, yes, put this sentence together.

297
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,640
 You probably have had too much to drink or are drunk.

298
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,760
 If you are swaying when you walk

299
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,800
 and you accidentally find yourself,

300
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,580
 or you find yourself accidentally tripping

301
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,380
 on a flat surface, you probably have had too much to drink.

302
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,200
 If you are taking shots, okay,

303
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,280
 I know this is not gonna be a popular one, shots fired,

304
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,320
 pardon the pun. (audience laughing)

305
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,160
 (laughing)

306
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,560
 That's not my notes, it's so bad.

307
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,200
 (audience laughing)

308
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,240
 It's kind of genius though.

309
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,480
 If you are taking shots, you probably

310
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,600
 are not drinking biblically,

311
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,280
 because there's really only one reason why you take shots.

312
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,640
 It's not like you're like, oh my goodness, this is,

313
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,480
 (audience laughing)

314
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,680
 this is delicious, what is this again?

315
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,240
 You're like, ah.

316
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,200
 You're probably not drinking.

317
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,400
 If you're playing drinking games,

318
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,920
 I know, I get another one where it's like,

319
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,760
 easy man, you're up in our business.

320
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
 If you're playing beer pong,

321
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,440
 you probably are not drinking biblically,

322
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,000
 unless you are a master with the ping pong balls.

323
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,120
 (audience laughing)

324
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,920
 And Paul would say, if you're drinking

325
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,080
 for the purpose of getting drunk,

326
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,720
 which I think a lot of us, I mean, let's be honest,

327
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,400
 if we were honest with Paul, and he says,

328
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,720
 hey, do not get drunk, or don't drink to get drunk,

329
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,520
 you're like, Paul, then why would I drink?

330
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,280
 And I think he would say, yeah,

331
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,920
 you should think about that then.

332
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
 (audience laughing)

333
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,360
 He says, do not get drunk on one,

334
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,720
 and I love it because he tells us why,

335
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,320
 and there's two reasons inside of the text

336
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,040
 that he tells us, and it's not,

337
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
 is it because God is against fun?

338
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,360
 Is that what this is about?

339
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,400
 No, it's because of where drunkenness leads,

340
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,040
 and he uses a word we really don't use anymore,

341
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,400
 the word debauchery, so today, probably at your job,

342
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,440
 you weren't like, oh my gosh, he debauched me.

343
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,920
 He's a debaucher, I tell him, no good, he's a debaucher.

344
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,960
 Debauchery is a word that we don't use a ton,

345
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,200
 but it just means reckless living.

346
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,160
 It means out of control living.

347
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,480
 And Paul says the reason why alcohol is a bad thing

348
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,640
 is not because God's against fun or your birthday party.

349
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,200
 The reason why he says don't get drunk

350
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,680
 is because he leads to a particular place,

351
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,840
 and one of the places that it leads

352
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,920
 is to out of control living,

353
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,720
 where you're no longer in control,

354
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,240
 but the alcohol has begun to take over

355
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,840
 your ability to speak, your ability to walk,

356
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,280
 your ability, oftentimes, to even think.

357
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,200
 And he says where it leads is no more good.

358
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
 It leads to out of control living.

359
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,680
 It leads to sending text messages that you regret.

360
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,480
 It leads to calling ex-boyfriends or girlfriends

361
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,360
 and letting them know you think

362
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,600
 you really should get back together.

363
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,440
 It leads to decisions that we wake up the next morning

364
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,260
 filled with regret.

365
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,840
 It leads to bar taps that we never would've racked up sober,

366
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,320
 paying for people we don't even know.

367
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
 He's like, it leads to out of control spending.

368
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,100
 It leads to out of control living.

369
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,980
 It leads to going home with someone

370
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,020
 that we don't even know their last name.

371
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,300
 I mean, sadly, it leads to an out of control living

372
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,480
 that for some of us, it's led to like,

373
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,320
 I gotta get an STD test because I slept with him

374
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,060
 and we didn't use protection or we,

375
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,000
 I went further than I wanted to.

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,260
 It leads to shame, hangover.

377
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,200
 And Paul would say, man, it leads you to a place

378
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,300
 that God does not want you to go.

379
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,920
 And this loss of control, it doesn't just make you,

380
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,600
 you shouldn't just not drink and drive.

381
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,700
 It makes you a worse dater.

382
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,760
 You shouldn't drink and date.

383
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,320
 You shouldn't drink and be a friend,

384
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,120
 drink and do anything that's gonna impair it.

385
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,140
 And Paul says, if you allow alcohol to take control,

386
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,580
 it will lead you to a place of reckless living,

387
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,040
 of regret, and of pain.

388
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,200
 And the worst thing, I think, he says,

389
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,720
 the place that it leads you to

390
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,360
 is really found inside of the context

391
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,520
 of everything that he said.

392
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,160
 And this is what I think Paul's biggest point

393
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,080
 in this whole thing is,

394
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,900
 it's gonna lead you to waste your life.

395
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,200
 Like, it's gonna lead you to waste those moments.

396
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,600
 I mean, that's the point in the entire context.

397
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,800
 He's like, dude, hey, look, okay,

398
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,560
 God created everything on this earth, your life.

399
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,280
 You're here for a reason, you're here for a purpose.

400
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,640
 You only got so many minutes.

401
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,840
 Don't waste them being wasted.

402
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,760
 Don't waste them being spent at the bar,

403
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,600
 having too many drinks,

404
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,280
 having those superficial conversations

405
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,440
 just 'cause you're both buzzed.

406
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,880
 And yeah, I like God too.

407
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,640
 Don't waste them in those conversations.

408
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,100
 Don't waste those moments of your life.

409
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,120
 You only have so many.

410
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,560
 That's his point.

411
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,640
 It's not like, hey, God's against beer.

412
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,240
 It's he's against you wasting your life.

413
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,920
 It's you not experiencing the purpose

414
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,480
 for which you were born, created.

415
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,540
 And if you're a believer for which God has saved you,

416
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,860
 it's you not experiencing a life full of meaning.

417
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,560
 By living in line with God's will in every situation,

418
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,080
 by seeing the world around you and living on purpose

419
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,840
 or living on mission for God,

420
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,280
 is it wrong to have a drink?

421
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,120
 It may be for you.

422
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,940
 I don't know.

423
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,020
 We'll talk about that a little bit more in a second,

424
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,960
 but that's not his point.

425
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
 His point is don't allow alcohol

426
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,160
 to lead you to a place where it takes you

427
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,440
 off of the reason for which you exist,

428
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,140
 the reason that you're here on this planet.

429
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,160
 I mean, you think about it.

430
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,720
 You never hear, as it relates,

431
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,020
 if we were to answer Paul's question of like,

432
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,480
 hey, don't get drunk because it leads to X,

433
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,420
 I think we may have different answers in the room

434
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,840
 based on our experiences, our own story,

435
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,480
 the stories that we know of our friends,

436
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,600
 but all of us would answer pretty much

437
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,160
 in the same genre of things.

438
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,520
 It leads to less than awesome things

439
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,040
 and God would be like, yes, do more of that.

440
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,320
 In other words, you never hear someone be like,

441
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,400
 hey, and then I got drunk

442
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,480
 and I had the most amazing quiet time I've ever had.

443
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,600
 Best time, God's word.

444
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,000
 I mean, it was rich.

445
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,840
 It was rich.

446
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,680
 You never hear that.

447
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,500
 You never hear someone be like,

448
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,760
 dude, I just, I got hammered drunk

449
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,920
 and then I had the best prayer time I've ever had.

450
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,480
 I never have heard someone say,

451
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,200
 man, I got hammered drunk and I just,

452
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,380
 I led this guy, I led my neighbor to Christ.

453
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,800
 I mean, I'm tearing up thinking about it right now.

454
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,960
 It just doesn't happen.

455
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,280
 But you do hear all the time,

456
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,000
 man, I got really drunk and I did X.

457
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,200
 And sometimes it's laughable and sometimes it's not.

458
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,040
 And Paul says, man, don't allow alcohol

459
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,460
 to rob you of a moment,

460
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,240
 of a life full of moments that don't have meaning,

461
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,320
 of a life that's void or doesn't have purpose inside of it.

462
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,120
 Like imagine if on that New York trip,

463
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,080
 if I had come back and I talked to some friends

464
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,560
 and imagine like the trip went totally different.

465
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,120
 Instead of going all this different places,

466
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,760
 I came back and you asked me how it went

467
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,320
 and I was like, yeah, it was good.

468
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,740
 And you're like, hey, did you go to Rockefeller?

469
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,420
 Did you go to Central Park and do the bikes?

470
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,360
 Did you go eat the frozen hot chocolate

471
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
 just like in serendipity?

472
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,920
 Did you go on the ice skating rink?

473
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,000
 Did you go to all the different things,

474
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,040
 you know, the Empire State Building?

475
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,720
 And I was like, no.

476
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
 What'd you do?

477
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,320
 It's a little fuzzy, honestly.

478
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,480
 We found this bar the first night

479
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,000
 and we got there and we had margaritas.

480
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,520
 My wife, she loves margaritas, me too.

481
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,960
 And we had like three, maybe four.

482
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,160
 Then we did shots.

483
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,320
 And it's kind of, I don't,

484
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,120
 I kept struggling to really remember.

485
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,240
 And then the next day we woke up,

486
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,180
 we slept in and we're dealing with the headache thing.

487
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,000
 So it was like, oh, we gotta get Starbucks.

488
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,240
 Oh man, so much pain.

489
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,240
 And then we just kind of waited out the day we ate.

490
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,200
 We ate in Chinatown, I do remember that.

491
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,760
 And then we did it, we went back to that bar

492
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,800
 that second night, that same time.

493
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,240
 Or that second night again.

494
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,800
 And that one I don't remember really at all.

495
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,280
 And then the next, and on and on.

496
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,600
 You'd be like, you wasted your trip to New York.

497
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,080
 And maybe you're going, oh man, that sounds so fun.

498
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,920
 I mean, think about it.

499
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,080
 You could do that in Dallas at least.

500
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,920
 We can all agree there.

501
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,000
 Regardless of what you believe,

502
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
 your Christian faith or any of that,

503
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
 you'd at least be like, yeah,

504
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,480
 you know that there's bars in Dallas.

505
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,460
 You don't have to do that inside of New York.

506
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,800
 Even if you are not a Christian,

507
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,300
 we would all agree there, you wasted,

508
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,320
 in other words, you missed out on the reason

509
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,920
 you went to New York.

510
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,760
 Which is to experience, to make the most

511
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,240
 of every moment that you had there,

512
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,040
 and you wasted it just hitting one bar after the next.

513
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,160
 In so many ways, that's what Paul is saying

514
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,560
 about your life and my life.

515
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,600
 Like if you spend it being drunk,

516
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,240
 you are spending it missing out on the reason

517
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,440
 why you're here.

518
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,280
 The reason that God has put breath inside of your lungs.

519
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,140
 The reason he's given you another day, another weekend.

520
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,280
 He says don't waste your life being wasted.

521
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,260
 And if you're not careful to do so as it relates to alcohol,

522
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,380
 you will allow it to rob you of meaning.

523
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,140
 Not only that, I mean, let's be honest.

524
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,820
 I think we could at least, most of us agree

525
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,580
 that alcohol, it like robs you of creativity.

526
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,060
 It robs you with some level of adventure.

527
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,180
 I know a lot of you are like, dude,

528
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,220
 have you ever seen The Hangover?

529
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,220
 That's my life.

530
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,540
 It's adventurous.

531
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,340
 Okay, for most people, what it looks like is like,

532
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,000
 dude, drinking in your life is just monotonous.

533
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,440
 Your weekends are monotonous.

534
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,600
 If you're a weekend warrior,

535
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,660
 you do the same thing every weekend.

536
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,100
 You're like, Friday's here, what are we doing?

537
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,680
 We're getting lit, get blacked out.

538
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,520
 And then Saturday's here and I'm gonna do it again.

539
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,840
 And then next weekend, I'm gonna do it again.

540
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,320
 And then after that, I think I'm gonna do it again.

541
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
 And then after that, I mean,

542
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,260
 that is the most pathetic life I can imagine.

543
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,740
 And if you're going, oh, dude, you just don't know.

544
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,840
 You don't know.

545
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
 And there's nothing, honestly,

546
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,680
 that I'm gonna be able to tell you

547
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,320
 that can make you believe that.

548
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,360
 But the God who's there has so much more for you

549
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,800
 than you numbing yourself to the pain

550
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,040
 of whatever's going on in your world,

551
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,400
 the stress of your job.

552
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,800
 Like he has invited you on this incredible adventure

553
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,280
 where he's leading you to a place

554
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,700
 where you experience meaning, not shame, in your life.

555
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,040
 And he says, if you live under the influence,

556
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,180
 you are headed towards destruction.

557
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,800
 And if you are, I think, tragically, honestly,

558
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,440
 there was an article that came out,

559
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,280
 or it wasn't even an article,

560
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,040
 it was a TED Talk by some psychologist

561
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,080
 and it was like how 30 is not the new 20.

562
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,520
 And it just talked about a common belief in our day

563
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,560
 where it says, man, young adults think that like,

564
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,020
 hey, my 20s is really, or 30 is the new 20.

565
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,720
 So I used to have to have everything together

566
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,960
 and by 20, I would begin to take steps in my life.

567
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,620
 And now I've got to 30, my 20s,

568
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,440
 I can just kind of do whatever I want.

569
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,760
 And the point of the whole conversation

570
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,000
 from the psychologist is what really God's Word confirms.

571
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,320
 Is that if you go through your 20 being like,

572
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,680
 dude, I'm just gonna, I'll deal with this stuff later,

573
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,520
 I'll grow, I'll develop as a person later.

574
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,060
 Right now, I'm kind of just living for the weekend.

575
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,160
 You are living without purpose.

576
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,880
 You are putting pause on even your growth as a person.

577
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,720
 I don't even know if it's pause,

578
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,500
 you may be going backwards.

579
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,240
 I mean, we've all met the dude at the wedding

580
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,200
 who's like 50 and you're like,

581
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
 you never left your fraternity.

582
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,000
 He's like, where's the keg stands, let's do this.

583
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,980
 And you're like, man, you are so tan right now

584
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,720
 and you never left your fraternity.

585
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,560
 And what happened with him is what,

586
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,960
 tragically, I think many people are doing right now.

587
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,440
 God doesn't say, man, life begins when you're 30.

588
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,400
 Right now, let me just tell you something,

589
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,880
 you are becoming something.

590
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,160
 You are becoming someone.

591
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,680
 You are working on, today you worked on your marriage

592
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,560
 and you may be thinking, I'm not even dating someone.

593
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,420
 Yes, you worked on your marriage.

594
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,960
 The type of spouse you're gonna be,

595
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,000
 the type of person you're gonna be,

596
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,240
 the career path that you're gonna be on,

597
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,200
 all of them will work today.

598
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,680
 You are becoming someone.

599
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,280
 You're not coasting in your 20s.

600
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,680
 You are becoming someone.

601
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,540
 And your relationship with alcohol

602
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,040
 is gonna be a key determining factor

603
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,500
 in the someone that you are becoming.

604
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,480
 And Paul says, don't let it have control.

605
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
 There is someone to have control of your life

606
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
 and here's where he goes next in verse 18.

607
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,520
 Instead, be filled with the Spirit.

608
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,640
 So we contrast drinking alcohol

609
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,040
 and being drunk or being controlled by that

610
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,760
 and he says, no, don't be controlled by that

611
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,000
 but be controlled or be filled with the Spirit.

612
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,960
 Speaking to one another in psalms, hymns,

613
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,980
 and songs from the Spirit.

614
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,960
 Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord.

615
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,520
 Always giving thanks to God the Father for everything

616
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
 in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

617
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,000
 So our second idea that we're gonna talk about

618
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,660
 after living under the influence

619
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,400
 is living in the Spirit.

620
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,980
 Well, Paul says, don't give yourself

621
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,320
 to being controlled by alcohol

622
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,760
 but do allow the Spirit of God to control your life.

623
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,440
 What does it mean to be filled with the Spirit?

624
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,840
 And this is so huge and there's lots of resources

625
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,780
 on watermark.org you can go listen to.

626
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,160
 So I'm not gonna cover it really in depth here

627
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,760
 but there's a lot of misconceptions

628
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,920
 about filled with the Spirit.

629
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,440
 In fact, one of them is the glow down on filling up.

630
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,040
 Our senior pastor here did.

631
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,700
 It's excellent and there's several messages

632
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,760
 that are involved there.

633
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,800
 But what does it mean to be filled with the Spirit?

634
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,680
 'Cause a lot of people would say,

635
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,880
 like, hey, to be filled with the Spirit,

636
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,220
 you gotta speak in tongues,

637
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,080
 you gotta have like some emotional experience.

638
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,160
 It was like, they'll express it like,

639
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,200
 oh man, that felt like the Spirit

640
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,560
 was so filled in this place.

641
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
 It was so rich inside of there.

642
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,040
 And I think people do that

643
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,160
 from well-meaning places.

644
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,000
 Biblically, what it means to have someone

645
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,180
 who is filled with the Spirit

646
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,880
 is the same idea of surrendered to the Spirit.

647
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,720
 The same idea of being controlled by the Spirit.

648
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,560
 What do I mean?

649
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,380
 What's an example of that?

650
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,080
 When someone says, hey, they're filled with rage,

651
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,280
 they don't mean there was like an injection of rage

652
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,420
 that went into their body.

653
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,800
 It means they were controlled by rage.

654
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,880
 Biblically, this is what it means to be filled

655
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,960
 is to be surrendered to or given over to

656
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,840
 the Spirit of God.

657
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,560
 That you and I are to do that.

658
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,300
 And Paul lays out really what that looks like

659
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,000
 by going into, hey, addressing one another

660
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,840
 with scriptural Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs,

661
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,640
 have spiritual or scriptural Bible things.

662
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,960
 Fill your mouth is what he says.

663
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,640
 Fill your mind or renew the way that you think.

664
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,000
 Fill your heart, he says.

665
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,440
 He uses all of these different things.

666
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,520
 He says this is what it looks like to be controlled

667
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,760
 or to be surrendered to the Spirit

668
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,840
 is you begin to allow God's Word to fill your mind,

669
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,200
 fill your heart, fill your mouth,

670
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,880
 and do it together with other people,

671
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
 addressing one another, he says.

672
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,520
 Does that make sense?

673
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,040
 It's not dissimilar to this.

674
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,040
 When I was, so in college, sorry.

675
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,360
 You guys talk amongst yourselves while I remember this.

676
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,320
 When I was in college, I worked at the summer camp

677
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,800
 during the summer, and there were these different stations

678
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,120
 where I was a counselor, and I would,

679
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
 every day you would wake up and they would basically

680
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,360
 put you at these different stations

681
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,660
 where you're the counselor that's overseeing the blob,

682
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,280
 or you're the counselor overseeing the trampolines,

683
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,040
 or overseeing the canoe and sail clinic,

684
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,840
 or overseeing the boats, or overseeing these different

685
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,800
 things, for whatever reason, often I would get put

686
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,180
 on the canoe and sail, and they would have these sailboats

687
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,560
 where you would have a bunch of campers that would come down

688
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,880
 and you're essentially like the head, like here we go,

689
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,160
 I'm the sail guy, come on in, I'll teach you how to do it,

690
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,400
 and you would load everybody up, and each camper would be

691
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,280
 on their own boat, you'd teach them how to do it,

692
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,520
 and you'd go through what it looks like to,

693
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,240
 if there's an emergency, and pulling out the sail,

694
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,200
 and all this different stuff.

695
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,680
 The biggest thing that you had to make sure

696
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,600
 that these kids would know how to do is they would have

697
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,560
 to pull the ropes on their sailboat,

698
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,200
 this little small sailboat, in a certain way

699
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,560
 that would expand open the sail,

700
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,920
 that if you're gonna allow the wind to take your boat,

701
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,360
 you gotta pull the ropes and it opens up the sail.

702
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,680
 It's pretty easy, other than that, you can't mess it up.

703
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,800
 So we'd go out there, we'd all get out,

704
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,480
 as the counselor, you're like, I gotta make sure

705
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,520
 none of these kids gets eaten by an alligator or something,

706
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,120
 here we go, Timmy, all right, here we go,

707
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,040
 and we'd go out, and inevitably, every single time,

708
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,880
 (laughs)

709
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
 there's no Timmy, every single time,

710
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,660
 there would be like, there would be a Timmy,

711
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,760
 we're just gonna call him Timmy,

712
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,200
 there'd be one kid that would be way in the back,

713
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,320
 and every time you're up front,

714
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,600
 and you're with all the other kids, and you're like,

715
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,480
 how do, you can't really turn the sailboat around,

716
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,280
 the wind is pushing this, Timmy, Timmy!

717
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,040
 Open up the sail, Timmy, pull the ropes,

718
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,160
 pull the, Timmy, look at me, Timmy!

719
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,240
 Pull the ropes, open up the sail to allow the wind to push,

720
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,920
 in other words, Timmy, you're not gonna move

721
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,080
 if you don't open up the sail, allow the sail to expand,

722
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,640
 and you will be moved in our direction,

723
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,360
 you'll move in the right direction,

724
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,320
 you are dependent, Timmy, on the wind,

725
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,980
 so open up the sail.

726
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,680
 And stay with me, 'cause this is the left turn.

727
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,840
 (laughing)

728
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,280
 In the same way, this is really what the Bible presents

729
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,520
 as it relates to walking by the Spirit,

730
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,880
 that you and I, what is our role?

731
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,080
 Our role is not to be the wind,

732
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,400
 our role is not to move the boat forward,

733
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,680
 our role is to literally just say,

734
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,460
 look, I'm gonna open up my life,

735
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,000
 I'm gonna open up my mind to God's Word

736
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,840
 and allow it to come in,

737
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,880
 I'm dependent on the Spirit of God

738
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,720
 if I'm gonna move my life in the right direction.

739
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,080
 I don't have what it takes on my own,

740
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,560
 I've got what's called a sin nature,

741
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,060
 everything inside of me that is just because of me

742
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,100
 wants to lead me in a wrong direction,

743
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,360
 wants to lead me towards an affair,

744
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,760
 wants to lead me towards getting drunk,

745
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,960
 wants to lead me towards getting high,

746
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,520
 wants to lead me towards materialism,

747
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,440
 everything about me is headed in the wrong direction.

748
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,160
 But when I allow the Spirit of God

749
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,320
 to fill the sails, if you will, of my life,

750
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,100
 that's the only way I can move in the right direction,

751
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,000
 so how do I get the Spirit of God

752
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,200
 to fill the sails of my life,

753
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,480
 to move me in the right direction?

754
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,240
 By opening up the sail,

755
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,780
 or opening up my mind, my heart, my life,

756
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,760
 to God's Word, to renewing the way that I think,

757
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,600
 allowing the Spirit of God to lead me,

758
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,460
 and when I do that, it moves me in the right direction.

759
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,280
 I'm dependent on the Spirit of God,

760
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,800
 and the way that I can access

761
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,540
 just being filled with the Spirit

762
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,020
 is by opening up my mind, opening up my heart,

763
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,700
 opening up my life to allow God's Word

764
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,600
 to renew the way that I think, the way that I live,

765
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,720
 the way that I see the world,

766
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,760
 and I do it with one another.

767
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,120
 That's what Paul just said.

768
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,140
 That's what he says inside of that text.

769
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,660
 This is how the spiritual life is lived,

770
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,100
 and where does it lead to?

771
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,320
 I mean, if the life under the influence

772
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,220
 leads to shame, regret, pain,

773
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,660
 leads to at least headaches and hangovers,

774
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,960
 where does the life with the Spirit lead to?

775
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,100
 Because he doesn't tell us here,

776
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,180
 but there is a place he tells us,

777
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,060
 and I'm gonna tell you briefly.

778
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,260
 You can write down Galatians chapter five.

779
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,880
 If you wanna read it later, it tells us where Paul says,

780
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,580
 look, hey, if you ever allow your life

781
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,460
 to be filled with the fruit of the Spirit,

782
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,820
 or you allow the Spirit of God to take over,

783
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,400
 and the more that you allow the Spirit of God

784
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,120
 to take over your life,

785
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,820
 here's what he's gonna produce inside of your life.

786
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,940
 He says this in chapter five, verse 22 of Galatians.

787
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,320
 But the fruit of the Spirit,

788
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,940
 what's produced by the Spirit in someone's life is love,

789
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:25,140
 joy, not depression, peace, not anxiety,

790
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:31,620
 forbearance or patience, kindness,

791
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,740
 goodness, faithfulness, gentleness,

792
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,940
 self-control, like unlike alcohol,

793
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,900
 where you lose more and more control

794
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,980
 the more you have of it,

795
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,740
 the more you have of the Spirit,

796
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,780
 or the more the Spirit has of you,

797
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,860
 the more you gain control over your life.

798
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,460
 And I love what comes next.

799
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,900
 It always ministers to me.

800
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,780
 Against such things there is no law.

801
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,300
 Paul, what do you mean?

802
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,120
 Yeah, against such things there's no law.

803
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,800
 There's no need for a law against these types of things.

804
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,740
 When that is the governor of someone's life,

805
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,820
 when the Spirit of God is directing someone's life,

806
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,900
 it produces things inside of them

807
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,060
 that if everyone was governed by that,

808
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,160
 we wouldn't need laws.

809
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,780
 We could take all the locks off the doors,

810
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,920
 you can leave your car unlocked,

811
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,260
 you don't have to worry about school shootings,

812
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,740
 you don't have to worry about any of that stuff.

813
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,580
 Because he says against such things,

814
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,640
 in other words, there's never been a law

815
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,840
 that's like, all right, hey, too much peace.

816
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,460
 Break it up, too much peace over here, too much joy.

817
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,140
 This guy's a little too kind for me, if you ask me.

818
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,060
 There's never been anything like that.

819
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,100
 He says against such things there is no law.

820
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:44,640
 It's really, it's such a beautiful truth.

821
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,060
 Because I grew up in a home that my parents divorced very,

822
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,460
 really, there was a lot of alcoholic abuse that took place.

823
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,220
 And it finally ended around age 12.

824
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:02,400
 And had the Spirit of God had control,

825
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,140
 over one of my parents,

826
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,800
 my story would have looked different.

827
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,240
 Not only would his life have been different,

828
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,320
 his children's life would have been different.

829
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,040
 And unlike the way that alcohol,

830
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,560
 it's not bad every single time,

831
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,240
 it's a gift from God, the Scripture says,

832
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,620
 but the places it can lead, the Bible says, be cautious.

833
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,680
 Because unlike alcohol, that's never a solution

834
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,600
 to people's problems.

835
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,560
 The Spirit of God is an incredible solution

836
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,060
 to what you're facing in life.

837
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,600
 In other words, you never hear the story.

838
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,520
 I mean, it's almost comical, but it's true.

839
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,360
 I never heard the story of somebody who came down front

840
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,920
 and be like, look, we were having tons of dating problems.

841
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,880
 And then we introduced alcohol.

842
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,260
 And everything's been incredible ever since.

843
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,760
 And then never heard the person,

844
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,720
 like, I was so far from God.

845
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,960
 And then I found shots of Patron.

846
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,080
 Turned it all around.

847
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,880
 It just doesn't happen.

848
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,860
 But when the Spirit of God begins to come in,

849
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,520
 wherever it comes in, the Bible tells us

850
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,720
 where the Spirit is, there's freedom.

851
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,200
 There's liberty brought in.

852
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,520
 There's life there.

853
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,440
 And that's what God wants to lead you and lead me to,

854
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,640
 if we'll just open up the sails of our life.

855
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,920
 So Paul says, don't be controlled by alcohol.

856
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,820
 Do be controlled by the Spirit of God.

857
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,780
 And so if you're anything like me,

858
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,120
 when I sit and listen to a sermon like this,

859
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,520
 I'm like, okay, don't be drunk on wine.

860
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,840
 Check, got that?

861
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,620
 Or anything else.

862
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,840
 Do be surrendered to God and his control.

863
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,760
 Can I have a Mambo taxi on Friday night or not?

864
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,660
 Can we just make it that clear and that simple?

865
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,780
 And so what I wanna do next is just talk really quickly

866
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,500
 about living in the tension.

867
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,460
 Because the answer is maybe.

868
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,960
 There's not a one size fits all.

869
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,040
 And so the third idea, if we're talking about living

870
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,840
 under the influence and where that leads you,

871
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,640
 living in the Spirit and where that leads you,

872
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,800
 the third idea is living in the tension

873
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,340
 the Bible presents as it relates to alcohol.

874
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,680
 'Cause you're right, Jesus, I mean, Jesus,

875
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,420
 his first miracle, turning water into wine, absolutely.

876
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,260
 People who like to drink,

877
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,420
 it's like their favorite Bible verse.

878
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,080
 Like, dude, Jesus was also called a drunkard in Matthew 15.

879
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,540
 Feels like we have something in common.

880
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,500
 And so there is this tension of like,

881
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,300
 man, there's incredible caution,

882
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,380
 and yet the Bible tells us in Psalm 104

883
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,140
 that God gave wine to make glad the hearts of men.

884
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,980
 And so am I free?

885
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,780
 Can you drink?

886
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,760
 And so I just wanna open the conversation,

887
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,180
 and if nothing else, honestly,

888
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,220
 if you leave here tonight and you begin to ask the question,

889
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,520
 why do I drink?

890
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,280
 Then I feel like I've done my job.

891
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,480
 Like, in other words, what you need to leave here

892
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,160
 and feel responsible for is the answer.

893
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,820
 In other words, it's Scripture to give this away.

894
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,940
 It's not a clear, like, yes, you can,

895
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,120
 as long as you're not getting drunk,

896
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,960
 you're always free to drink.

897
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,800
 The question is all about why.

898
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,680
 What's at the heart?

899
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,880
 Why are you drinking?

900
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,760
 And you gotta wrestle that down.

901
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
 There's clear parameters.

902
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,620
 I'm about to lay out a few of which,

903
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,240
 of why, when it's clearly not okay, but why?

904
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,720
 Like, literally, I want you to think about it.

905
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,000
 You can write that down if you can't,

906
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 if you're not, if you think, oh, he's saying, like,

907
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,100
 one of those things he really didn't want me

908
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,940
 to actually do.

909
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,980
 I really want you to think, why are you drinking?

910
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,160
 Every time.

911
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,760
 Here's why I wanna drink right now.

912
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,320
 Here's why I want a drink.

913
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,160
 Here's why I want this drink.

914
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,920
 Here's why I'm drinking right now.

915
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,480
 Begin to be thoughtful every single time.

916
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,400
 I mean, if nothing else, that's what the Bible

917
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,220
 would command all of us to.

918
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,280
 And there's certain outliers that it would clearly say,

919
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,640
 no, you definitely should not drink.

920
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,340
 Or this is an occasion where you, for sure,

921
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,180
 should not drink.

922
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,040
 I'm gonna go over a few of those.

923
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,360
 But if you leave here and you just wrestle,

924
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,000
 you begin to be thoughtful about, hey, is it okay?

925
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,760
 Am I, is the reason I wanna drink right now

926
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,020
 okay in God's eyes?

927
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,320
 Then I feel like I've done my job.

928
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,240
 But here's some of the reasons why it would not be

929
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,200
 a good idea to drink.

930
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,380
 If you need to drink or do not drink

931
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,560
 to achieve a state of mind, if you're like,

932
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,400
 I just need to escape, I just need to get outta here,

933
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,360
 I don't wanna remember anything,

934
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,880
 I'm so overwhelmed with life,

935
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,240
 that's not a good reason to drink.

936
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,100
 Truly, the Bible says that you and I, over and over again,

937
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,860
 it says that we're to be sober-minded, sober-minded,

938
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,020
 on the alert.

939
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,940
 First Peter five, Romans 12, verse three,

940
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,380
 First Thessalonians five, verse six,

941
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,900
 and over and over again.

942
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,740
 That you and I are to be sober.

943
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,140
 So if you're like, man, I just wanna check out,

944
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,260
 that's not a good reason.

945
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,700
 So if that would be how you would answer the question,

946
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,400
 that's not a good reason to drink.

947
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,220
 Do not drink to get over a need.

948
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:50,860
 Or because of a need, if you're like, I need a drink,

949
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,080
 my boss was crazy today,

950
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,640
 that's probably not a good reason to drink.

951
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,600
 And I know sometimes people say that in joking,

952
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,580
 but if you're not able to be like, I was kidding,

953
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,380
 I really don't need it, I'm fine, I'll be okay without it,

954
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,120
 then you probably are drinking to fill some sort of need.

955
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,060
 What do I mean by need?

956
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,560
 Like if you're like, hey, I need,

957
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,920
 I need a drink in order to have fun tonight, am I right?

958
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,440
 If you need a drink, because what you're doing,

959
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,240
 in order to have fun at what you're doing,

960
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,240
 what you're doing is not fun, or neither are you.

961
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,840
 There's something going on there,

962
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,060
 (congregation laughing)

963
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,520
 and if that's the case, and that's why you're drinking,

964
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,760
 that's not a good reason to drink,

965
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,100
 and you're like, well, it just makes me a better dancer.

966
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,240
 It doesn't make you a better dancer, number one.

967
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,660
 (laughing)

968
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,420
 I'm sorry, I could go here longer, but I'm not going to.

969
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,700
 (congregation laughing)

970
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,300
 It's not a good reason to drink.

971
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,360
 If you're drinking to get over a breakup,

972
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,060
 it's not a good reason to drink.

973
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,880
 If you're drinking, could confuse, discourage,

974
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,840
 or tempt someone around you, it's not a good reason to drink.

975
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,440
 Romans chapter 14, if you want to go read it later,

976
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,280
 you can write that down.

977
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,160
 Romans chapter 14, First Corinthians 10,

978
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,880
 Paul lays out essentially this argument

979
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,140
 that happened inside of a couple of the early churches

980
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,540
 where it's a kind of a longer,

981
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,400
 it's hard to condense really quickly,

982
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,580
 but essentially, the churches were debating over

983
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,520
 whether or not you could eat meat, sacrifice to idols.

984
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,040
 So Paul was like, dude, this meat, it's filet mignon,

985
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,900
 it was sacrificed to an idol, those idols don't exist.

986
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,280
 I can eat this all day long, it's not gonna be a big deal.

987
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,160
 All they did was like, hey, we give this to you, Zeus.

988
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,680
 Zeus isn't real, so people eat up steaks on the thing,

989
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,500
 and they defended people, and they were like,

990
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,840
 I can't believe you did that, and Paul went,

991
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,160
 okay, time out, hey, if it's gonna offend anyone,

992
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,140
 we can't do this.

993
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,480
 If it's gonna cause anyone to stumble,

994
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,360
 and he says they're the weaker brother

995
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,960
 'cause their faith doesn't allow them to do it,

996
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,080
 but even so, he says, I'm not going to use my freedom

997
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,080
 that I have if it's gonna offend, confuse,

998
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:57,120
 or discourage, or tempt anyone that I'm around.

999
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,480
 So if your drinking is gonna do that,

1000
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,100
 am I saying that you should sacrifice

1001
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,720
 or not take advantage of the freedom that you have to drink

1002
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,920
 if it's gonna discourage, tempt, or confuse someone?

1003
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,760
 Yes.

1004
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,440
 Even there, you gotta be thoughtful,

1005
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,920
 that when you go out to drink, I mean, that the context,

1006
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,400
 hey, the people that I'm gonna be around,

1007
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,000
 are they gonna be tempted to get drunk?

1008
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,840
 Are they gonna be discouraged or confused by like,

1009
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,920
 hey, I thought you were a Christian?

1010
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,460
 Is it gonna bring clarity to the fact that,

1011
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,820
 oh man, Christians can have that?

1012
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,600
 Will it allow you to have an incredible conversation?

1013
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,640
 Is the way I'm drinking and when I'm drinking

1014
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,800
 going to confuse, tempt, or discourage different people?

1015
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,960
 I mean, context is everything.

1016
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,400
 I mean, think about it.

1017
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,440
 If I pull out this Dos Equis,

1018
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,940
 everyone just got a little quieter in here.

1019
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,080
 (congregation laughs)

1020
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,480
 And if I take it, and is this not okay?

1021
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:54,040
 Oh man, I would drink to that.

1022
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,120
 Need a lime.

1023
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,960
 It's water, people, good grief.

1024
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,000
 (congregation laughs)

1025
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Man, this is, everyone's like, oh my gosh,

1026
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,840
 pastor?

1027
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,760
 (congregation laughs)

1028
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,280
 What sort of church is this?

1029
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,680
 (congregation laughs)

1030
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,520
 Why would that not be okay?

1031
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,120
 I mean, some of you know the reason.

1032
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,760
 Some of you are just like, oh man, I don't know.

1033
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,360
 If I like seeing the pastor have a Dos Equis.

1034
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,880
 (congregation laughs)

1035
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,720
 But the reason it's not okay is because it could discourage,

1036
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,480
 it could offend, it could confuse people

1037
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,160
 who may not have either the familiarity

1038
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,800
 with what the Bible teaches on it,

1039
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,160
 or may not be in a place in their own life

1040
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,600
 where they're like, dude, that's a part of my past.

1041
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,720
 That's a part of my alcohol.

1042
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,360
 Claire, I'm gonna give this to you so don't tip it over.

1043
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,960
 Hey, no sips, okay?

1044
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,360
 Keep an eye.

1045
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,720
 But there's times where it's okay

1046
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,560
 and times where there's not.

1047
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,680
 And the Bible says there's a place,

1048
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,200
 and if the people that you're around

1049
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,920
 are gonna be discouraged or confused or tempted by it,

1050
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,080
 then don't.

1051
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,200
 The fifth reason is if you cannot, stop.

1052
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,840
 Do not drink if you cannot stop.

1053
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,320
 Like Blake Shelton said, the more I drink,

1054
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,640
 the more I drink.

1055
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,840
 And it's very deep, Blake.

1056
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,000
 (congregation laughs)

1057
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:17,160
 And this truly, I think, is a legitimately decent size

1058
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,280
 of the audience right now.

1059
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,440
 Who are you like, man, I don't know if I can stop.

1060
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,360
 When I have one, it means I had eight.

1061
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,720
 And you need to be honest with yourself,

1062
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,200
 be honest about why, and you need to seriously evaluate,

1063
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,440
 should you even drink?

1064
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,720
 Maybe you need to take a time where you don't,

1065
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,360
 and you're like, dude, it's not that big of a deal, okay?

1066
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,160
 Look, drinking, I don't need it.

1067
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,960
 It's not that big of a deal, great, then don't do it

1068
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,520
 if it's not that big of a deal.

1069
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,840
 I could stop if I want to.

1070
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,520
 Prove it.

1071
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,000
 If nothing else, do it yourself.

1072
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,960
 Some of you may be just like,

1073
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,440
 hey, I'm not having alcohol for a month.

1074
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
 I don't wanna be a slave to this.

1075
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,280
 I don't wanna be in chains to this.

1076
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,120
 Fifth reason is to not drink if you can't stop.

1077
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,040
 And this is a more serious problem in the room

1078
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,440
 than most of us would be honest enough to admit.

1079
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,840
 (congregation laughing)

1080
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,720
 If you leave here,

1081
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:21,000
 and you don't feel at least the inclination,

1082
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,960
 you've gotta be honest.

1083
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,520
 Hey, is it okay for me to drink in this situation,

1084
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,880
 right now, right here?

1085
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,120
 I mean, that's what the Bible says,

1086
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,560
 that it's not always okay.

1087
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,120
 It's not just, hey, it's clear, it's fine,

1088
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,520
 it's good for me, whatever you say, pastor.

1089
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,000
 There is a tension, and so all that I'm asking you to do

1090
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,360
 is step up to the line of being thoughtful.

1091
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,440
 Is this gonna discourage people around me?

1092
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,480
 Is this gonna confuse my example of my Christian faith?

1093
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,000
 Is this something where, man, I can't stop.

1094
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,040
 Am I doing this to get over something

1095
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,280
 that is a part of my life,

1096
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,360
 or some pain that I'm experiencing here?

1097
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,300
 To be thoughtful in every situation.

1098
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,160
 I'm gonna invite Ryan to come back up,

1099
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,720
 and we'll play a video in a second,

1100
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,080
 but it's just a video that was captured

1101
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,720
 from some of our video team

1102
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:14,080
 of a guy who really stepped into experiencing his purpose

1103
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,000
 over the last year, or a little over a year ago.

1104
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,060
 He's a guy who spent many years,

1105
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,680
 and you'll see in the video, not experiencing his purpose,

1106
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,060
 and he met Jesus, and everything changed.

1107
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,320
 He met Jesus, and he began to find freedom,

1108
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,200
 and he began to find what I hope you hear,

1109
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,720
 and nothing else, not that God's anti-beer.

1110
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,480
 He's pro-you, and pro-you experiencing the purpose

1111
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,000
 for which you exist.

1112
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,160
 You guys, listen and watch my friend John.

1113
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,440
 - My name is John Satriano,

1114
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,560
 and I'm a recovering drug addict alcoholic

1115
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,220
 saved by the grace of God.

1116
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,040
 Ever since I can remember,

1117
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,400
 I cared a lot about what people thought of me.

1118
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,760
 I let it define me.

1119
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,360
 I was so empty that the opinions of others

1120
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,640
 made up my character.

1121
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,420
 So the keys to my peace were in other people's pockets,

1122
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,960
 which is a dangerous place.

1123
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,880
 And it was around the age of 15

1124
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,840
 when I started to fill this God-sized hole in my heart

1125
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,280
 with worldly things.

1126
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,480
 It was the first time I got high.

1127
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,300
 It was the first time I got drunk,

1128
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:18,980
 and it sparked this 11-year spiral out of control.

1129
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:24,820
 Very soon, I found myself neck deep in an addiction,

1130
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,600
 a daily-use addiction to cocaine and alcohol.

1131
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,400
 I remember coming home and seeing my mom

1132
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,040
 hysterically crying on the couch,

1133
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,000
 and my dog barking at me,

1134
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,800
 because it was like I was hurting my mom so much

1135
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,080
 to see her son like that.

1136
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,480
 And at that time, I could've told you

1137
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,040
 that I didn't care at all.

1138
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,640
 And it was around this time last year

1139
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,000
 where I had nothing left.

1140
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,200
 It was then I decided I needed to get help,

1141
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,860
 and so I entered into a faith-based rehab.

1142
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,160
 It was there that I found that my drinking and drugging

1143
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
 wasn't my problem.

1144
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,760
 It was the solution to my problem, which was my heart.

1145
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,880
 And so during the 90-day stay at rehab,

1146
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,840
 I made the longest journey that I could ever make,

1147
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,960
 and that was from my head to my heart.

1148
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,400
 I remember specifically being in my counselor's office,

1149
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,240
 coming to the realization that my entire life

1150
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,400
 was built on this false self

1151
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,240
 that was choking the life out of me, pride, ego.

1152
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,520
 And I remember in that moment

1153
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,800
 feeling two hands on my shoulders

1154
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
 and hearing a voice that said, "I'm here with you."

1155
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,720
 And it was God.

1156
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,200
 And from that moment, I leaned on the only power

1157
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,200
 that was ever gonna save me,

1158
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,920
 and that was the power of Jesus Christ.

1159
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,920
 It is because of Christ that I'm not a slave

1160
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,240
 to that lifestyle anymore, that substance.

1161
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,240
 And through that, through just handing over my will to God,

1162
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,560
 he's reconciled so many relationships.

1163
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,200
 And he's given me a life today

1164
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,560
 that I could not have imagined.

1165
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,480
 The makeup of my days now is filled with just a peace

1166
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,080
 that exceeds understanding.

1167
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,060
 My name's John, and that's my story.

1168
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:04,320
 (congregation applauding)

1169
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,240
 - That's awesome.

1170
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,440
 Let me be really clear.

1171
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,900
 John encountered Jesus, and it changed everything.

1172
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,500
 He met a man who would forgive him of his sins,

1173
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,120
 who would begin to heal the heart that he had,

1174
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,760
 the brokenness of his heart,

1175
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,960
 the sin that had infected him.

1176
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,880
 And he found healing, and he found purpose.

1177
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,720
 Now, let me be also really clear.

1178
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,860
 John, just like the sinner on this stage,

1179
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,940
 just like the sinner in that seat,

1180
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,480
 could in a moment, if he has not surrendered to God,

1181
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,520
 saying, "Here is the soul of my life.

1182
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,000
 "I'm opening up the sail to you, God.

1183
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,620
 "I'm gonna renew my mind.

1184
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,320
 "I'm gonna walk by your spirit.

1185
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,980
 "I'm gonna lean in dependence on you,

1186
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,140
 "not in dependence on alcohol,

1187
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,980
 "in dependence on cocaine, on anything else, God.

1188
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,740
 "In a moment, I can turn my back on you."

1189
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,760
 And it all hinges on whether John, day after day,

1190
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,240
 takes up his cross, dies to himself,

1191
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,880
 says, "I'm gonna surrender to you again today, Lord.

1192
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,700
 "I'm gonna walk with your people around me.

1193
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,420
 "I'm not gonna chase the dreams of this world

1194
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,840
 "and the pleasures of the world around me.

1195
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,820
 "I'm not gonna chase materialism,

1196
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,980
 "get in a bigger car, more money in my bank account,

1197
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,260
 "whatever other lies the world around me is trying to sell.

1198
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,760
 "I'm gonna walk in dependence on you, God.

1199
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,760
 "That's the only way I have any shot."

1200
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,600
 And in a moment, John, everything could fall apart,

1201
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,500
 and he knows that.

1202
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,720
 Do you know that?

1203
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,080
 Do you know that the shambles around your life right now,

1204
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,880
 and somebody in this room needs to hear me in this,

1205
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,120
 you're not gonna be able to pick 'em up

1206
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,420
 and put 'em back together.

1207
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,320
 You can't do it, you're not strong enough.

1208
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,360
 You don't have what it takes.

1209
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,200
 There's a God who's there.

1210
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,920
 If you'll open the sail of your life,

1211
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,080
 surrender to him,

1212
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,440
 will come in and lead you to a life and a place

1213
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,200
 unlike anything you could even imagine.

1214
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,680
 And you'll find purpose.

1215
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,740
 You'll find life.

1216
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,720
 And you'll find Jesus.

1217
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,000
 So more than enough, he is enough.

1218
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,760
 That's what life is about.

1219
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,320
 If you've never trusted in Christ before,

1220
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,160
 if you've never had a moment

1221
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,600
 where you put your faith in him,

1222
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,840
 tonight is your night.

1223
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,240
 The last thing I'd wanna leave you with is don't drink.

1224
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,160
 If you're numbing with alcohol to numb your pain,

1225
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,440
 and you're like, "Dude, I don't believe in God,"

1226
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,320
 you should drink more.

1227
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,480
 You should drink, you shouldn't stop.

1228
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,000
 That's what I would do if I didn't have the hope

1229
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,080
 that is found only in Christ.

1230
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,440
 You look at a world around us

1231
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,280
 and all the brokenness that is there.

1232
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,320
 If you can be sober and atheist,

1233
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,540
 I'm confused.

1234
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,320
 Because you don't have any hope.

1235
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,240
 And you may tell yourself you do.

1236
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,720
 You're not standing on anything that has hope.

1237
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,840
 And Christ alone offers that.

1238
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,640
 And maybe you are a Christian,

1239
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,800
 and you look around and you're in shambles.

1240
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,600
 Jesus, if you would surrender and walk with him,

1241
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,200
 day by day offers to lead you

1242
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,160
 to a life like you could only dream of.

1243
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,240
 Let me pray.

1244
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,760
 Father, thank you

1245
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,280
 for the ways that you're at work in our life.

1246
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,960
 Thank you that the vision you have for the Christian faith

1247
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,600
 is so much bigger than don't drink beer.

1248
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,360
 How pathetic of a dream vision goal would that be?

1249
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,800
 But the vision you have for us

1250
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,000
 is that we would experience abundant life.

1251
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,440
 Thank you for the ways that you worked

1252
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,140
 in my friend John's life.

1253
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,160
 Would you continue to do so?

1254
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,000
 Would you continue to do so in my life?

1255
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,880
 Take ground in my heart in the places

1256
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,000
 where I need more of your spirit to take more of my heart,

1257
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,880
 and I need the things of Jesus to grow

1258
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,480
 and the things of David to die.

1259
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,360
 Father, for anyone in this room

1260
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,620
 who's never accepted the free gift that you offer us

1261
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,960
 by dying on the cross in our place

1262
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,520
 to pay for our sin, past, present, and future,

1263
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,060
 and rising again, the free gift,

1264
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,240
 if they'll just accept and trust in that,

1265
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,160
 would tonight be their night?

1266
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,400
 Would you do what only you can do?

1267
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,940
 Just move in their heart, move on their heart.

1268
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,880
 Father, I pray for those of us who are evaluating,

1269
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,720
 would you lead us to evaluate why am I drinking right now?

1270
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,080
 And help us to be surrendered to the spirit of God,

1271
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,720
 and would he fill our sails in this life

1272
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,560
 through our dependence on him?

1273
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,240
 We worship you now in song, amen.

1274
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:43,240
