[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [Music]
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   All right, all right, all right. Porch, how we doing? Doing okay? Yes? Hey, it's great to be back with you tonight.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   So grateful that you joined us from wherever it is you came from. I don't know if you're here from out of town,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   if you're a regular in the room. We always have some Porch Live locations tuning in with us on Tuesday nights as well.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   So special shout out to all of you that are tuning in with us online, especially Fresno, Scottsdale, Tulsa.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   We love you. Thanks for being here with us. Hey, we've been in the middle of a series in the book of Colossians,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   which we're continuing tonight, but I want to open up with an illustration, which I think may be helpful.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I remember starting my first job out of college and finding the experience confusing to say the least.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Anybody have that same experience? You jump out of college, you get into your first job, and you're like,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   "What is happening right now? This is not at all like what I expected."
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Let me explain to you why that was the case for me. You see, normally, when you step out of college,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   you walk the stage, you make your way into your first job. You are in the midst of a lot of anew.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You've moved into a new city. You've found a new place to live.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   You've committed to a new set of responsibilities during your week. You're trying to find new friends.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   You're trying to understand the new landscape, a part of which you are now calling home.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   This is the case for many of us when we step into a new job, especially out of college.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   But this was not the case for me because I graduated and I stayed right where I was.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I didn't move cities. I didn't change locales. I didn't even leave the place where I was living.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I stayed in College Station, Texas, because I went to Texas A&M University,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   aka the promised land. It's a holy place. Hang in there with me.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   No, I stayed in the same city which I had spent the last four years at that time,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   which meant that I lived a lot of the same normal regularities for me that I had lived previously.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I had the same roommates, and I lived in the same house, and I went to the same restaurants,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and I went to the same gym, and I went to the same church.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I was a part of all of these sames that had been a part of my story.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   They were continuing forward for me, which sounds really great, right?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Man, that sounds nice. You can acclimate to a new job.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   You can be a part of a new set of normal rhythms while also having all the same friends
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   in all the same places and all the same things, which you would think is true,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   but was not the case for me. You see, because with a new job came a new way of life,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   and with that new way of life came a new set of expectations.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You see, where the old me would choose to skip class if he wanted to—totally hypothetical—
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   the new me could not skip work. Where the old me could choose to take as many hours as he wanted for lunch,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   the new me got one hour for lunch every single day.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Where the old me would look at his week and say, "Man, I don't have as much work to do as I thought."
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   The new me would look at his week and realize, "I have plenty of work to do."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Where the old me could spend as much time as he wanted at the gym,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   the new me had to either get up in the morning or go at the end of the day.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   My old rhythms did not fit with my new way of life.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Which sounds pretty miserable, right? You would think it's great,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   but then you hear, "Man, you're not able to enjoy any of the same things you used to
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   because of the new way of life you're now a part of?" That sounds awful.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And yet, I would tell you, it was amazing. Why?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Because though it was disorienting, I was kind of in my old stomping grounds
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   while still living a new way of life. That new way of life was worthy of figuring out.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And the reason for it is because I loved everything it afforded me.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   The opportunities it gave me to grow and the lessons it would teach me,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   the responsibilities that were imparted to me, the money that I made,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   the team that I joined, the company I worked for,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   the fact that I didn't have to go to class.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Instead, I was entrusted with something that was meaningful.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I loved all of this that was now a part of my new way of life.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   But here's the thing that you need to know.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I tell you that because when you step into a new way of life,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   there are often new lessons to learn.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   That was true for me. I wasn't able to just do the things that I had done.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I now had to do new things instead.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And that is the case for those that place their faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   When you step into life with Christ, you embark upon a new chapter of life.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And everything changes for you.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Like you get new opportunities to grow.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   You get new experiences to enjoy, community to find, responsibilities to sue.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   You get all of this newness, which is really amazing.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And yet, with that new way of life, come new lessons you have to learn.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I tell you that because that's where we're at tonight.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   You see, we've been journeying through the book of Colossians.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And as we come to chapter 2, which is where we are this evening,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   that you can turn to right now if you want,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Paul is hinging from everything he's been saying,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   pointing to, hey, this is what it looks like to walk into relationship with Jesus
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and then walk out of that relationship as you live your life forward
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   to now talking about what's next,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   which is important and relevant for the Colossians that he's writing to.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Because this group of young believers, they are asking the question,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   we've placed our faith in Jesus.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   We understand everything you're saying, Paul.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   But now what? We want to move forward.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   We want to mature in our spirituality.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   We want to advance. We want to take new ground.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   We want to get better, which may feel like you.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   You've been walking with Jesus.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Maybe you've just recently started investigating the person of Christ
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and you're trying to evaluate for yourself.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Okay, I'm kind of into this. I believe in him even.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   But where do I go from here?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   This is the question the Colossians are asking as well.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   They want to know what it looks like to not just be as they are,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   but to become everything that God wants them to be.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And so Paul, he moves into chapter 2
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   and he starts to write to them a series of lessons they need to learn.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And he's doing so to refute a lot of the lessons
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   the world is perpetuating at them instead.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   You see, in their context,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   there's this thing known as the Colossian heresy.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And basically, it's a group of false teachers
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   that are looking at them and saying,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   hey, if you want to find superior spirituality,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   if you want to advance into a greater human experience,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   add all this other stuff to your life.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Like believe in these different things.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Acquire this new knowledge.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And Paul is saying, as we transition from 1 to chapter 2,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   looking at verse 3, he says, you don't have to do that.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Because in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   You don't need to look anywhere else.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   If you want to grow and go forward,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   the way you do it is by looking to him.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   We've said this.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Maturity in life comes through clarity of Christ.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   That's the big topic, the main theme of this entire book.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And as we move forward into the rest of Paul's letter,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   he's going to begin to unpack for us
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   what specific lessons we need to learn
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   if we want to walk into the wholehearted fullness
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   that is available in Jesus.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So this is what he says, starting in verse 6.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   "Therefore, in light of the fact that you do believe in him,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   as you received Christ Jesus the Lord,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   so walk in him, rooted and built up in him,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   established in the faith, just as you were taught,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   abounding in thanksgiving."
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   How does Paul choose to teach these young believers
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   the way of walking in Jesus?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   How is he going to teach us the way of walking in Jesus?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   In a really strategic way.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   He looks at them and he says,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   "Hey, you need to learn how to walk in him
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   by comparing it to the way in which you received him."
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Which is a really great strategy
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   for teaching somebody something.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   How do I do that?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Do this the way you did that.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   The way you did X, now you go do Y.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Which begs the question then,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   how did they receive Christ?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   With extreme care.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   That's what they do.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   They received Christ with extreme care.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Because Paul uses a term here that's interesting.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It's actually a technical word in Judaism
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   that refers to the transmission of teaching
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   from one person or generation to another.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   So just think about that most beloved family recipe
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   that you have.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   That thing which has been handed down
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   with painstaking care from one generation to the next.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   What is it for you?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   That is how they have received the good news of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   With painstaking detail.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   With meticulous care.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   They haven't just received it carelessly.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   They've received it carefully.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   There's nothing casual about this.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   They heard the good news of Jesus
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   and they received it with intense focus.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   They wanted to learn.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   They had heard the stories of this man.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   They had read the reports of what he'd done.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   They had even learned of his impact
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   in the lives of other people.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And they said, "We've received this.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   So now what do we do?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   We want to believe this.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So we've acquired great knowledge of these things."
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   You see, their lives were transformed
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   because their hearts were transfixed
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   on the one who would come to save them.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And, Ports, the same should be true for us.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Which is why it's really important
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   when we talk about faith in Jesus,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   believing in God,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   that we don't just pin our faith
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   on the basis of something really rather weak.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   That's why it's not enough to believe in Christ
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   because your parents do.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Or to follow Jesus because it's socially advantageous
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   to do that here in the South.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   It's a good way to meet people and find friends.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   We don't walk with God
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   because our boyfriend or our girlfriend,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   they kind of like him, and so I guess I should like him as well
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   because I want that relationship to sustain.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   We don't follow him because we want to get out of hell free card.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   These are all bad reasons to walk with Jesus.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Contrary to popular belief,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   there are in fact bad testimonies out there.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   What makes a bad testimony?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Not the absence of divine intervention.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   "Man, there's not really like a burning bush
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   or a pillar of fire in my story."
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   That doesn't make a bad testimony.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   There are loads of people like that.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   What makes a bad testimony
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   is not the absence of divine intervention,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   but the presence of personal indifference.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   "I don't really care. He seems like a nice guy.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I guess I should religiously ascribe to someone.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It might as well be him."
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Paul's saying, "You don't receive Christ like that."
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   That's not how they've received him.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   They've received him with great care.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   They are absolutely, utterly transformed
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   because they are totally transfixed on this man, Jesus Christ.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And the same should be true for us.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   You see, we don't believe in Jesus because it's convenient.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   We believe in Jesus because we're convinced.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   We're convinced.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   We've heard the facts of his life.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   We've read the report ourselves.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   We've beheld the beauty of his character.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   We've observed the wonder of his nature.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And we've received his forgiveness firsthand.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And because we've done these things,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   we can't help but believe.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   We can't help but be spurned forward towards more.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And we can't help but want to learn as much as possible.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Paul is saying, in the same way that we've received him like that,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   as undeniably true, like, "Man, I cannot refute the fact that this is all actually accurate."
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   The way that we've received him as that is the way we should walk in him.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   You received him with great focus.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   You should walk in him with great focus.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   As he moves through this, he moves from the indicative form to the imperative form.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Which just means he makes an indicative statement.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   He indicates something that's true.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   He makes a statement of fact.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   You received Christ.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   That's observable. That's factual.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   We can say that that actually happened.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   He moves from an indicative statement, you've received him,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   to an imperative statement, which is a command.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   So then do this.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   That's where he moves as he goes along.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   He says there's no hiatus between believing in Jesus and behaving like a Jesus follower.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   They go hand in hand.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Their two sisters tied at the hip.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   You place your faith, you walk in him.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   It just goes together.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   That's what he's unpacking for us.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Why? Why is that the case?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Because Jesus is not just a nice guy.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Like he's not just a lesser household God.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   He's not just a mythological hero.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Someone we study in books.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   The reason there's no gap, no hiatus, no distance,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   between a believer and Christ-like behavior
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   is because Jesus is Lord.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   That's why.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   That's what he points to.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   You see, Paul's first lesson to us is this.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   If you have received Christ and you want to walk in him,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   then the claim that Jesus is Lord
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   should be met with the reality that you treat him as Lord.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   If you say Jesus is Lord, then you treat Jesus as Lord.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Which begs the question for all of us,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   what's a Lord do?
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Do we have any Lords in America?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   I was thinking about this in the green room just a minute ago before I came out here.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   My staff, we have a variety of different office spaces.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Some of us sit in offices, others of us sit in cubicles.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   My personal assistant, she has a cubicle.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It's right outside of my house.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   She is the Lord of her cubicle.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   She rules over all that happens within that cubicle.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   She reigns over it.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   That's what it means to Lord over something.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So, if Jesus is Lord, what kind of Lord is he?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   What's the extent of his reign?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   How great is his reach?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Philippians 2 tells us, it says,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   "Therefore, God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   so that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord."
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Like, who is Jesus Lord of?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Every name, every knee, and every tongue.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   He's over it all.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Which makes the claim that if he is the Lord of my life,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   then I absolutely should treat him as the Lord of my life.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I walk in him. That's important.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Paul says, "You walk in him."
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Not ahead of him, that he's someone you outpace,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   that needs to catch up to your lifestyle.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Not behind him, because you don't want to be associated with him.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Not around him, because he's a problem or an inconvenience to avoid.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   No, you don't walk in front of him, behind him, around him.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   You walk in him.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   In him.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   He is in complete totality, fully surrounding all of your being.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Right?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Have you ever put on one of those giant bubble soccer uniforms?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Jesus is like the bubble.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   He surrounds your entire being.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   He has lordship over every aspect of who you are.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And he has a lordship that says,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   "I care enough and I'm capable enough to provide for you."
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   How do we know that?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   How do we know that Jesus cares and is capable?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Because he cares enough to lay his life down.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And he's capable enough to take his life up.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   He loves you and he's powerful for your sake.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   So as you walk in him, totally encompassed,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   you're safe, you're provided for, you're protected.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   This is the good news of the gospel.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   That when you receive Christ, you don't just get part of him.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   You get all of him.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   But he also gets all of you.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Because that's what Paul is saying next.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   You walk in him.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And then he gives you four descriptors of how you're supposed to walk in Jesus.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   What does he say?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   He says, "Walk in him, rooted and built up, established in the faith,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving."
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   He gives four descriptors for what it looks like to walk in Jesus.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Walk in him, rooted in him, built up in him, established in him,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   and abounding in thanksgiving.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Which can feel really overwhelming.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Like you may be here tonight and you're just trying to figure out the whole Jesus thing.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And then you hear a list of punch items that you need to accomplish
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   or a checklist that you need to work through.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Oh, I'm supposed to root myself in him, be built up in him,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   establish my life in him, and be thankful?
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Like that sounds exhausting.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Like this is overwhelming.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   This is why I want nothing to do with religion.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   If that's what you're hearing as Paul works through these descriptors of how we walk in Jesus,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   let me just help you understand that's not what he's saying.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   He's not looking at you and saying, "You've placed your faith in him.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   You've signed on the dotted line."
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Perfect. Okay, let's get to work.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   We've got a bunch of different things that we need to do.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   You first need to get rooted, then you got to get built,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   then you got to get established, and then you get thankful.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   You ready? Here we go.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Like that's not Paul's perspective on your life.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   If you've made a claim of faith in Jesus.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   No, he looks at you and he says, "This is actually going to be much easier than you think."
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   I'm not going to bore you with the grammar.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   But if you go and you study the way that Paul writes this,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   these four descriptors actually leave you with really only one thing.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   You're truly, personally responsible for.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   He says you're rooted in Christ.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   When he says that you are rooted in Christ, he is saying you are already completely rooted.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   It's complete. It's done.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   It's in the perfect tense, which means there's nothing you can add to it.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   You have been rooted in Christ.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   You place your faith, you're rooted, you're safe, you're secure.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And yet, it doesn't just mean that you're completely rooted,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   you're also continually being built up.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   You're being built up and you're growing stronger.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Like that's a continual process.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It's one where when you study it, you partner together with God.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   God's going to help you grow and girder.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   He's going to make you taller and stronger.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   But your participation is required, right?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Completely rooted, continually built up and established.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And then lastly, you're consciously thankful.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Consciously thankful.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   That's your job.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   That's what he leaves you to do.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Hey man, we're going to work it out together.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   You're rooted. We're going to partner.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   You just be thankful that it's all happening.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Is God egotistical?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Does he just need you to be glad that he's involved in your life?
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Heap up some praise, lift up some hands.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Is that his perspective?
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Is that his heart's posture?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   No.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   If you're going to lift thanks to God, what does it require?
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   That you see something worthy of rejoicing in.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   God's heart for us is that we would look at him and we would see a
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   bounty of thanksgiving.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And as we see that, it would lead us into great gladness.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Irrefutable joy.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Indomitable praise.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Because God is good.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   He's saying, hey, I need you to be thankful.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   How does that happen?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Just look at me.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Get more of me.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Lean in.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Acquire as much as you want.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   There's so much here.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   I'm so good.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And the longer you look, the more gratitude you'll feel.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   This is what it means to walk in Jesus.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   These four things.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   This is the first lesson he gives.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   He's saying, hey, if Jesus is your Lord, then you treat him like your Lord.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   But that's not the only lesson he offers.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   He keeps going.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   He says, see to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   empty deceit according to human tradition.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   According to the elemental spirits of the world and not according to
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Christ.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   For in him the whole fullness of the deity dwells bodily.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   The second lesson that Paul wants us to know is the world will offer you
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   what only Jesus can give.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   The world will offer you what only Jesus can give.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   When Paul says, see to it that no one takes you captive in verse 8.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   We're meant to read that with a strong warning that dangers are nearby.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Right?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   So when you go to the beach, there are certain flags that the lifeguards
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   will raise in order to what?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Alert you to present dangers in the waters.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Red flags mean there's a rip current.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Water's not safe.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Purple flag means dangerous marine life present.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Which means there's something out in the water that you may not want to
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   tango with.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   What would happen if you walked out into those waters and you did not pay
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   attention to the warning sign?
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   You might find yourself face to face in your chubbies with an apex
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   predator.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Which is a really bad spot to be in.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Can we just admit it?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Like I know you think you're bad, but that's not a good position to find
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   yourself a part of.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Paul is saying, hey, I'm raising a flag.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Take notice.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Look at this.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   There's danger around.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   He's using predatory language.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   You see the Greek word here for captive is a compound word that literally
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   means to carry prey off.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   It's to carry prey or victims.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   So he's saying, hey, when you walk through this world, there are going to
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   be a myriad of people, a variety of voices that are looking at you and
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   saying, hey, follow this.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Do this.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Trust this teaching.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And yet, though they may seem trustworthy, they do not have your best
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   interest at heart.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   They're going to spend something super captivating.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Key word, captive.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   They want to take you hostage.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   And so he's alerting you.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   You be aware.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   It's like what advertisers do in fast food commercials.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Why do those pancakes stack so high when you look at them upon the
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   billboard?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Because the marketers have wedged cardboard between every single one of
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   them.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   And that syrup just looks amazing.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Yeah, it's because it's motor oil.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Or like that picture of your favorite pie with that perfect dollop of
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   whipped cream on top.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Yeah, that's shaving cream.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Or the cheese pizza that just looks so ooey gooey delicious.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   It's not ooey gooey.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   It's ooey gluey.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   It's glue.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   It's not cheese.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   It's not that.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   It's false advertising to you.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   They look trustworthy.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   But they're not to be messed with.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   The world in the same way will falsely advertise to you.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   False teachings, heretical ideas, they aren't immediately obvious or
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   glaringly wrong.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   They won't simply stand out as bad for the Colossians.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   These false ideas, they come through what Paul describes as human
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   tradition and elemental spirits.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Why does that matter to us?
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   That just sounds like a lot of religious speak.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   But what is he talking about?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   He says, hey, they're preaching to you Colossians with human tradition
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   and elemental spirits.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   He's saying, hey, they're going to speak to you something that looks like
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   it has a ton of veracity.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Because the more ancient the tradition or the more elemental, fundamental,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   the spirit, the more veracity that it was true in this ancient context.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   The older it was, the better it was.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   That's the way to put it simply.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   The irony of that is for us in our modern day, it's not the old things
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   that demand our attention, it's the new things.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   We see something new and we deem that it's best.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   We look at something that is improved and we actually assume it's an
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   improvement.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   But Jesus himself, he tells us in Matthew 10, 16, he says, hey, behold,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I'm going to send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   more predatory language.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   So you be wise.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   You be wise as serpents and you be innocent as doves.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   You have discernment and you have blamelessness.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   You see, as we move through this world, we're meant to be discerning.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Knowing full well the world will over promise and under deliver every time.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Hey, if you want to find fulfillment, let's talk about your job.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   You just invest in your career because there's a goal that you want to reach.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Yes, like let's just hustle harder.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Give up more time, compromise more of your morals, and you'll eventually
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   ascend to that platform, into that position.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   You'll attain all of that responsibility and it's going to be awesome.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And then you get there.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   You climb the proverbial ladder and as you stand at that spot,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   you realize there's only one more rung to climb.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   You're still in fact as far behind as another group of people as you felt
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   from where you first were before.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   You're not nearly as happy here as you anticipated you would.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   This is with your career.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   This could be in anything.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   This could be in relationships.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   This could be in reputation.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   I want to be someone that's admirable, respected.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   I want to make a difference in the world.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   It could be something about pleasure, experience.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Listen, these things are not inherently bad.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   In fact, they're pretty important.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Career, relationship, reputation, these things are good things.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   They're important things.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Porch, they're not ultimate things.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And thus, because they are not ultimate, they will never satisfy.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   They will not deliver on the promise they've made that fullness is right here.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Step right up and take as much as you want.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   How do I know that that's the case?
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Because there is one who is ultimate where fullness is actually found.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   That's what Paul says.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   He says in verse 9, "For in him, the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   and you have been filled in him who is the head of all rule and authority."
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   All the fullness of God dwells in this man, Jesus.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   So all the fullness you seek, guess where it's found?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   In him as well.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   It's interesting.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   I talk to young adults all the time.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And as I visit with them, often what I find myself engaging in conversation about
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   is that their job just isn't as life-giving as they thought it would be.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Or their friend group's just not as life-giving as they thought it would be.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Or that commitment they made, that leadership position they have,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   that volunteer role they hold.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Man, it's just not giving me life.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   It's not supposed to.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   No job, no relationship, no group of friends is supposed to give you life.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   For us to say that language in the church, within the walls of this own building,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   shows that the world has permeated our midst.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's come inside.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   I'm looking at you and it's saying, "There is something we could add to Jesus."
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Have you thought about X, Y, and Z?
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Those things are not meant to give you life.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   He is.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   That's why all things are meant to be done to the glory of God,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   because it's in the glory of God that you find rich satisfaction.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   This statement, "fullness of deity" that Paul uses,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   it's loaded with meaning.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Because in the Old Testament, any time the word "fullness" pops up,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   it's most often talking about the presence of God, the fullness of God.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And any time "deity" pops up, it's talking about the essence of God.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   So when he says "fullness of deity,"
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   he's saying the presence and the expression, the essence of God,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   they're found in Jesus.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   All of God's person, his being, and all of his personality, his doing,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   it's in him.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   That's where you can find it.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   That's why fullness is available.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   What Paul is getting at is that Jesus is God.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Unbelievable.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Have you seen him?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   He's unbelievable.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Become God perceivable.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   He is God's transcendence.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   He is God's eminence.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Power in the form of a person.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   That's what we talked about last week.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And that's what Paul is hammering at right here.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   He's the fullness of God.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   So in him we find the fulfillment for ourselves.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   But it's not just that.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   In verse 11, "In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   having been buried with him in baptism,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   who raised him from the dead."
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Without getting into too much detail,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   circumcision was a physical sign in the Old Testament for the people of God
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   that Paul is referencing right here to refute this claim
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   that because the Colossians are not ethnic Jews,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   they can't be a part of the people of God.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   You're not circumcised, so you can't be in here.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   He's saying that's not true.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   That's not actually the case.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   He's saying, no, it's not by human hands that you become a part of God's family.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   It's by way of God's own hands.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   That's what he does.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   It's not a circumcision physically.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   It's a circumcision spiritually.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   It's of the heart.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   He says it like this in Romans 2, 29.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   "But a Jew, an ethnic Jew, is one inwardly,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   and circumcision is a matter of the heart."
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   He's saying if you want to be identified with the people of God,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   it's not by blood, it's by spirit.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   That happens inwardly.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Circumcision is a matter of the heart by God's spirit,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   not by the letter of the law.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   His praise is not from man, it's from God.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Which is good news to us.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Because what Paul is saying is,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   if you want to be in the family of God,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   the door is open for anyone and everyone.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   There is no barrier to entry.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   You can come in here.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   You can grab a seat at the table.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Anyone is welcome here because God is the one that brings people into his family,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   and he does not discriminate.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Everyone is welcome right here.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   How, Paul?
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   How is that the case?
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Because that unbelievable God that has become a perceivable God in Jesus,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   don't miss this,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   has also become a receivable God.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   He's not just a God you can know.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   He's a God you can have.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Because that's Jesus' heart.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   He wants you in his family.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   That's why he came.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   He came to cross the divide,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   to bridge the void and bring you back to God himself.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And not just save you from your sin,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   but save you into a whole new way of life
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   in fullness forevermore.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   The reason this matters for our room
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   is because some of us here
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   feel a lot like these Colossians.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   We do feel like there's a barrier to entry for us.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   We do feel like we don't belong in the family of God.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   We look at ourselves and we say,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   "You don't know what I've done."
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   "Have you seen my resume,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   the mistakes that are littered thereupon?"
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   "I'm disqualified from this thing."
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   "I'm unqualified to get in."
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   "I'm inadequate to be a part of God's family."
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   "I have a stain so deep, no one can clean it."
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   And yet God is looking at you and saying,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   "No, I can clean it."
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   "How?"
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   "By my own blood."
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   "I will clean you."
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   "I will wash you out of snow."
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   "I will bring you to myself."
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   "And you will remain with me forever."
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   This is such good news
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   because it's not a result of anything we do.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   It is in spite of everything we've done
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   that we come into the family of God.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   And it's through the person of Jesus.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   That's what Paul unpacks for us
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   as we continue into our final point.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   He says in verse 13,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   "And you, who were dead in your trespasses
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and the uncircumcision of your flesh,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   God made alive together with him,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   having forgiven us all our trespasses,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   by canceling the record of debt that stood against us
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   with its legal demands.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   He disarmed the rulers and authorities,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   and he put them to open shame
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   by triumphing over them in him."
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Paul turns the corner,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   and he gives us our final lesson
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   that those fully forgiven should live fully free.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Those fully forgiven should live fully free.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   What's the best motivation for living free?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   The reminder of what you've been freed from, right?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Anytime I speak to my nieces and my nephews
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   and I learn about their schoolwork,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   I rejoice, man, 'cause those days are behind me, you know?
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I'm reminded of what I've been freed from.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   I have graduated from the imprisonment
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   of my former education,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and now I don't have to do those things any longer.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   When you're reminded of what you've been freed from,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   you're motivated to live into your freedom.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   That's what Paul's pointing to.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   That's why he spends the next three verses
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   unpacking specifically three problems
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   we've been delivered from.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   He wants to add fuel to your freedom.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   He wants to pour gas onto your gratitude.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   So what are the three things that we've been delivered from?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Verse 13, regret from our past.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Verse 14, debt for our sin.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And verse 15, threat of the enemy.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Regret from our past.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   These are the things which result
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   from the trespasses Paul talks about in verse 13,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   which raises the question, what does it mean to trespass?
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   In the Greek, it literally means to take a false step,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   to go somewhere you're not supposed to be.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   When I was in high school,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   every summer my youth group, we would take a mission trip,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   which meant every summer,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   we would inevitably prank the girls.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   The boys would go on this trip,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   and we would, like a thief in the night,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   try to prank the girls.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   We would try to go into their quarters
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   and absolutely wreak havoc and leave them a memory
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   worth telling about for days forward.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   How would we do it?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   We would trespass.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   That's how we would do it.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   We would sneak into their room under the cover of nightfall.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   We would do so after our chaperones had fallen asleep.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   We would execute plans that we had carefully
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   and meticulously prepared.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Plans that included things like cling-wrapping toilets
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   and hanging cheese puffs above their door
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   so that when they opened it, it would rain down upon them,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   filling their shower heads with Kool-Aid
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   so that we would leave them oh-so-sticky.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Very devious exploits.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   This is what we would do.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   We would trespass in order to make it happen.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   We would go someplace we shouldn't have been
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   to do something we shouldn't have done.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   This is what Paul's talking about.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   He's saying, "Hey, you've not only trespassed
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   "against one another, you have trespassed against God."
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   We've lived our lives selfishly,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   hating God, hurting one another.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Romans says that even our conscience
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   bears witness against us, that intrinsically,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   we know the world is not as it should be, nor am I.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   And so he's saying, "Hey, you are filled with regret.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   "You know you are not doing what you should,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   "and you have good reason for doing it right."
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   And yet, because of what Jesus Christ has done upon his cross,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   he has answered for every single one of our trespasses.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Everything we've done wrong,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   every place we never should have been,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   he has borne the full consequence of it
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   in himself upon his cross.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   And thus, we have no reason to regret any longer.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   We have every reason to rejoice.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   That's what he's pointing towards.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   We have been freed from our regret.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   We have absolutely been relinquished from those things
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   which held us in shame and guilt and condemnation.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   But it's not just that.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   We've not just been freed from our regret.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   We've also been freed from debt of our sin.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Verse 14 says that God made us alive
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   by canceling the record of debt that stood against us
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   with its legal demands.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   This he set aside.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   He nailed it to the cross.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   What does that mean?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Our sin against God had racked up a huge tab,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   one that we could not pay.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   And so Jesus stepped in our place,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   and he paid the balance in full.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   How did he pay it?
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   With his own life.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   He has canceled the record of debt.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   There's nothing that can hold you bound captive
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   to sin and death any longer
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   because he has paid it completely.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Romans 8, 33, 35, 37 says,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?"
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   It is God who justifies.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Who is to condemn?
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Christ Jesus is the one who died.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   More than that, was raised.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Who is at the right hand of God?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Who indeed is interceding for us right now?
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Shall tribulation or distress or persecution
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   No.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   In all these things,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   we're more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   We've been freed from any debt for our sin,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   and we've also been freed from the threat of the enemy.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   When he gets to verse 15, he says that he, Jesus,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   disarmed the rulers and authorities,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   and he put them to open shame by triumphing over them in him.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   Paul uses an image when he says the word triumph
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   that would have struck a chord with his audience.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   You see, this word triumph, it's a word picture.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   That when a king would return after vanquishing an enemy,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   he would carry in his train all those foes
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   which he has now brought captive.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   And as he parades his enemy through his city's streets,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   triumphing over them in full,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   that king's people can look upon that enemy,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   the one who once harmed them,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   and realize he has been rendered harmless.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   And I have reason to praise.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   I have reason to celebrate.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   I have reason to build in confidence
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   because I am associated with one
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   who could defeat my threat for me.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   We have no reason to fear.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   There are no longer any regrets for those in Christ Jesus.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   There is no longer a debt of sin against you,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   and there is no power or threat from an enemy.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   All of it has been ultimately, finally,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   and totally overwhelmed by Jesus Christ himself.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Do you know him?
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   This man who is the Lord, the Lord God.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Like Jesus is over everything.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   He is supreme.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   He is dominating in all of his power,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   and yet he is also tender in all of his care.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   He's Lord over all, including you.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Will you not treat him as such?
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Will you not submit to him?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   For he and he alone offers the fullness of life,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   which you are desperate to find.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Jesus came to give life.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   The Lord God became a servant to man,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   and in giving life to us,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   he laid down his life to accomplish it completely.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   He poured himself out as an offering to God on our behalf.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Christ has borne our death.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   That way we may no longer worry or fear
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   that death is still ahead.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   We have nothing to sit in trepidation over
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   because Christ Jesus has come to give us life,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   but not just that he has come to fully forgive,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   that we might be fully free.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Jesus did die, but he didn't stay there.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   He rose forth from the grave.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Like he burst forth from his tomb,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   and in so doing, he has declared,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   "Hey, there's not just forgiveness for you.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   "There is freedom.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   "I've risen that you might rise,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   "that you can come with me where I am."
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Not just one day out in eternity, though that's true.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   You can live into all the freedom available
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   by way of my resurrection right now.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   This is the gospel.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   Will you walk in it?
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Let me pray for us.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Father, so thankful just to teach your word.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   So grateful, God, that through it, you've spoken to us.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   God, I thank you that I have friends here
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   in this room tonight,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   that God are truly across a spectrum of spirituality.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Some in here, God, that have walked with you for so long,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   that God are in fact rooted,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   and they are being built up and established, God,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   and they do rejoice and give thanksgiving.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   But others, God, here as well,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   that they don't know you.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   You just stumbled into this space.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   They wandered in haphazardly, God.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   I'm thankful, Lord, that there's not a soul in this room
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   here by happenstance.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   All, including you, brother or sister,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   are here because he willed it to be.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   There is something from his word,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   something in this room that he wants for you tonight.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Maybe it's his lordship
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   and the provision and safety that comes with it.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Maybe it's the life he offers
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   and the fact that with him, fullness is actually found.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   Maybe it's forgiveness that leads unto freedom.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   I don't know what it is for you,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   but you are here because he wants something for you.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   That's the heart of our God.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   He doesn't need anything from you.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   We can add nothing to him,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   but he wants everything for us.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   He's a good God, and his name is Jesus Christ.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   He is a king that has come to lead all captives home,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   for he has overcome anything that would imprison,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   enslave, or separate us from God forever.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   We're so thankful, God, that this is true.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   We rejoice in you,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   and it's in your name we pray, amen.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Porch, let's stand together, if you would, right now.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Yeah, I don't know what tonight's felt like for you.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   I don't know what God's doing in this moment,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   but I would just ask, not for my sake,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   I'm gonna be here next week, but for yours.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Don't rush out.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Don't race away.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   God's been working to this moment now,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   and he wants to meet with you.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   He wants to take you further, wants to lead you deeper,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   wants to know you more.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Do you want it for yourself?
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   We've got a team down front that would love to pray with you,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   process with you.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Some of you need to come down and pray with somebody.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   I'm just gonna say it.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   If you come forward,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   you will never tell us something that would ever surprise us.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   We would love to pray with you.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   We would love to process whatever it is God is doing in this space.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   Let's sing together.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
