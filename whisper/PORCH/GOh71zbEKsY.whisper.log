[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.060]   So great to be with you guys tonight.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.520]   If you are with us from the Church Leaders Conference,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.900]   we wanna welcome you to the porch.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.080]   And if you're a first time guest with us, awesome.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.360]   Hi, mom.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480]   And so excited.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.400]   Hey, we are in 1 Peter chapter four.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.600]   I'm gonna read verses seven through 11.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.180]   The end of all things is near.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.460]   Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray.
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.120]   Above all, love each other deeply
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.080]   because love covers over a multitude of sins.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.280]   Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.000]   Each of you should use whatever gift you have received
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.960]   to serve others as faithful stewards
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.960]   of God's grace in its various forms.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.520]   If anyone speaks, they should do so
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.160]   as one who speaks the very words of God.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.400]   If anyone serves, they should do so
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.080]   with the strength God provides
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.720]   so that in all things, God may be praised
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.220]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.800]   To him be the glory and the power
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   forever and ever, amen.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.120]   Well, Father, we thank you just for this eternal truth
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.880]   that you penned through your servant
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.480]   by the power of your Holy Spirit
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.040]   nearly 2,000 years ago
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.160]   that we would read it this evening
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.700]   and be inspired and have a greater understanding
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.360]   of what you desire for our lives,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.440]   help us to apply it to our lives
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.440]   and to, as we examine it like James says,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.760]   that we would make changes to our lives,
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.200]   the things that are inconsistent
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.440]   with your scriptures in our lives,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.120]   that they would be conformed more to your will,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.720]   more to the image and the character of your son Jesus.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.320]   So thank you for this privilege.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.900]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.480]   I'll start with this question.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.480]   What is on your bucket list?
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.360]   What are the things on your bucket list?
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.800]   This term bucket list, it comes from
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.560]   the things that you want to accomplish
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.580]   before you kick the bucket, that is before you die,
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.240]   before you pass on to the next life.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.200]   What are the things that you hope to accomplish
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960]   in this life before then?
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.280]   And so I just kind of pulled the audience
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280]   through social media.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.240]   If we're friends on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram,
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.720]   I've asked this question.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.760]   And the way that I asked it, I said,
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.200]   "Hey, if you had found out you had 30 days to live,
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.360]   "what are the things that you'd wanna do
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.120]   "in the next 30 days?"
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.760]   And so I got a lot of different answers,
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.560]   but there were things like hike the Appalachian Trail.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.960]   There were some that were spiritual.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.900]   Some folks said, "Hey, well, I would share the gospel
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.080]   "with everyone I can."
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.080]   And I appreciate that, but a lot of them
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.560]   were just like things you wanna accomplish
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.880]   like summit Mount Rainier, get married,
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.200]   write a book, lease a Lamborghini,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.300]   scuba dive the Great Barrier Reef,
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.160]   run with the bulls in Spain,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160]   go to Harry Potter World.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.760]   (congregation cheering)
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.440]   Single for life.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.760]   Get a tattoo, meet with the president,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.400]   go base jumping, and go skydiving.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.200]   Skydiving was on mine.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.920]   That was one of the things that I wanted to do.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.720]   And I had my closest friend, he knew this.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.920]   And so for my birthday, he gives me this gift certificate
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.320]   to go skydiving.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.040]   And so we call, I'm excited,
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.280]   we're making plans to go and do this together.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.520]   And we call, and I'm on the phone with this lady,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.080]   and we're scheduling it, and she's kind of walking through
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   some things that I need to know,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.480]   and she said, "I just need to make sure you know
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.120]   "we have a 240-pound weight limit."
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.380]   And I said, "Oh, that's problematic, I'm 250 pounds."
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.740]   And she said, "Oh, okay, well, you know,
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.200]   "there might be something we could do
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.760]   "to make something work."
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.160]   And I was like, when I'm jumping out of airplanes,
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.840]   I'm not trying to make something work, okay?
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.960]   No, thank you.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.800]   And so needless to say,
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.500]   that's not on my bucket list anymore, a diet is.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.320]   No, it's not.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.840]   It's not on my bucket list anymore
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.640]   because here's what happened a few years ago,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.840]   really through that experience,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.960]   I began to realize that everything on my bucket list
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.800]   was about me.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.980]   That all the things that I had hoped to accomplish
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.360]   before I died were selfish experiences
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.200]   and momentary pleasures
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.400]   that I would experience in this world
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.720]   that it's like I didn't believe
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.000]   that I was gonna live in some redeemed version
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.840]   of this world,
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.680]   that God wasn't going to ultimately bring heaven here
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.800]   and that I would exist here forever.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.840]   I don't need to see Thailand today,
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.080]   I'll see one day a glorified, redeemed version of Thailand.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.440]   That I'm His.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.600]   And this bucket list idea,
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.520]   it's really a pagan idea.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.440]   It's the idea of someone who does not believe
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.720]   that they're going to live forever with Christ.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.360]   And so realizing this,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.640]   it allows us to focus on what is a real bucket list.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.120]   Peter's going to tell us this evening
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.960]   that the end of all things is near
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.600]   and the only thing that lasts forever is God,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   His word and the souls of people.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.480]   And so we need to prioritize
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.400]   that which is most important to God.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.720]   Peter is going to tell us,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   here's what really matters.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.360]   You're running out of time.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.560]   You might have a next day,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.600]   but one day, sooner than you could ever imagine,
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.760]   you're going to have a last day.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.720]   And the only thing that's promised to you,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.240]   the only thing you truly possess is now.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.440]   That's the only thing you really have now.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.920]   Tomorrow or two minutes from now is not promised to us.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.200]   One of the persons that responded
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.720]   to my social media questions said,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.280]   I'd give everything away.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.000]   And that's most in line
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.160]   with what Peter's going to show us this evening.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160]   And so we're talking about what it means
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.600]   to live like time is running out.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.840]   Really, that is the bucket list that Christians should have.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.040]   Peter's going to present it to us here in chapter four.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.160]   And so my points as I move through these verses
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.600]   are pray, love, give.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.680]   Pray, love, give.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.880]   I know that sounds like a Julia Roberts movie,
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.560]   but it's not because eat, pray, love.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.040]   If you've seen it,
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.880]   it's this really self-actualization,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.960]   self-fulfilling, selfish-seeking movie.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.040]   Hey, I want to go and find myself.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.240]   We don't need to find ourselves.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.400]   God already found us.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.960]   He has plans for us,
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.720]   and we don't use our time on earth
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.480]   to fulfill momentary pleasures for us.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.360]   We use it to seek out his will and do it.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.200]   And so 1 Peter 4, verse seven.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.840]   The end of all things is near.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.000]   Now, if you read that, right off the bat,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.320]   Peter may lose credibility with you
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.960]   'cause you're like, man, he wrote this 1,900 years ago.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.440]   Like, what do you mean the end of all things is near?
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.160]   It's over a thousand years later, like how?
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.520]   And so it's like two days ago, I was getting a haircut.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.560]   My wife dropped me off with some of the kids,
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.760]   and they were waiting,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.160]   and I finished getting the haircut,
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.180]   and then we were sitting there,
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.360]   and they were kind of looking out into the parking lot
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.080]   as she was gonna come back and pick us up,
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.560]   and they said, "Daddy, we should go over there
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.400]   "to Trader Joe's.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.600]   "Let's go to Trader Joe's and get a snack."
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.720]   And I said, "I can't.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.760]   "We can't do that.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.360]   "Mommy will come back any minute, and we need to be here."
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.400]   And as 10 minutes go by,
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.560]   they showed me that we could've went to Trader Joe's,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.620]   basically saying, "You're wrong when you said
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.840]   "mommy could come back at any minute,"
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.200]   but the truth is I wasn't.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.520]   I wasn't wrong.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.680]   She could come back at any minute,
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.760]   and when she came back, I needed to be there
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.360]   so she would pick us up and give us a ride home.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.200]   And when she came back two minutes later, we saw that,
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.960]   and so right now, the sky could crack open,
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.840]   clouds roll back like a scroll,
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.280]   there's Christ on a white horse coming for his church.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.160]   It could happen right now, tonight, tomorrow,
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.760]   while you sleep, any moment, Peter's saying.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.300]   And so he tells us then,
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:46.760]   "Therefore, be alert and of sober mind that you may pray."
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.040]   And so the summary is the end is near.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.000]   Jesus is coming back at any moment,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.680]   so pray with a sober mind.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.840]   It's the word, a sane mind, the opposite of insanity.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.480]   Pray in your right mind.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.720]   Have you ever seen, like if you've been in Times Square
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.240]   or maybe even downtown, those people with the sandwich boards
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.240]   that say, "The end is near, the end is near,"
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.400]   and you walk by those people and you're like, "Crazy."
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.880]   Peter's saying, "Ah, what if
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.500]   "they're the most sane people out there?
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.000]   "At least their perspective is correct."
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.800]   Like you may not have lived your moments today
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.780]   like the end is near, and he's admonishing us
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.800]   through God's word that that is how we are actually to live.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.720]   Time is running out, and so with a sane mind and sobriety,
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.560]   pray, my first point, pray with perspective.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.620]   Pray with a right perspective.
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.920]   Praying for the right things comes from praying
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.580]   with this right perspective that the end is near.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.380]   When someone finds out, I've learned this
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.320]   in vocational ministry, when someone finds out
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.240]   they are dying, they only have a short time
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.240]   on earth to live, they sober up.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.740]   It's all of a sudden priorities start to just kind of
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.020]   fall in place, and the worldly desires that we chase,
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.200]   those kind of fade, and it's like, okay,
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.920]   who do I need to show that I love, and what do I need to do?
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.980]   And when I talk to God, it's just like it's he and I.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:26.400]   It's tremendous sobriety, and so it's realizing,
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.200]   we're realizing that time is running out,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.240]   that we're on this clock that's ticking down,
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.600]   and that any minute, not just like this hourglass,
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.200]   that any minute we could realize that Jesus is coming back
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:44.960]   as lives, like this is more like the earth,
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.200]   and it's like the granules of sand in there,
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.480]   those are human lives passing from one life to the next,
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.720]   from the life to the next, that started
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.400]   at the beginning of the beginning,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.120]   and that's the motion that God,
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.880]   that's the clock that God put into motion,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.720]   and we're existing in that, and one day,
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.300]   it's gonna be done, it's gonna run out.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.200]   And so this perspective affects two things in praying.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.840]   I give them to you, frequency and content.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.760]   Frequency is just this idea that when we're in trouble,
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.800]   we pray more, when we realize that time is running out,
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.020]   we pray more, we pray with greater frequency.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.320]   Some might call these game day prayers, right?
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.560]   Like you're facing, you want a promotion,
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.480]   Lord, please give me a promotion,
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.000]   you're in trouble at work, you got written up,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.920]   Lord, please help me to survive this.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.800]   God, I pray she's not pregnant.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.020]   God, I pray I'm not pregnant, right?
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.240]   These are these game day emergency prayers,
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.880]   you just got a diagnosis that you don't like, right?
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.600]   And so you start to pray, it's when you go
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.880]   and you pray more.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.000]   You're on the airplane, and you hit rough air,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.800]   the pilot calls it, we know it as turbulence.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   It's like, oh, whoa, hey God, it's me again,
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.760]   hadn't talked to you since last time I was on a plane,
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.160]   but would you please safely carry us to the ground?
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:10.200]   And you're praying with great focus, with great sobriety.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.700]   The other thing that changes with this understanding
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.940]   is content, the contents of our prayers.
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.120]   The new believer prays for one thing,
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.700]   the new convert prays for one thing,
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.780]   whatever they want.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.720]   That's okay, that's you.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.200]   That's all right, as long as you're asking God,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.560]   God, show me what you want, I'm gonna pray for what I want,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.400]   I'm asking what you want, you know, it's just honest,
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.820]   God wants a relationship with you,
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.060]   and so as you pray for you what you want,
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.800]   you're building a relationship with him,
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.680]   but as you mature, your prayers turn outward.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.740]   You begin to see that there's others around you,
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.680]   there's this world that God has you existing in,
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.120]   that there's things that he wants to accomplish
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.160]   through you in this world.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.180]   So what's the difference between worrying and praying?
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:03.040]   What's the difference between worrying and praying,
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.400]   being given to worry and given to prayer?
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.580]   The difference is one is a productive conversation
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.480]   and the other is a faithless waste of time.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.000]   Worrying is a faithless waste of time,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.360]   while praying is a productive conversation with God.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.240]   The only difference between worrying and praying
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.840]   is one has another person there listening,
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.320]   it's an act of faith.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.000]   And here's the gift that I have for you worriers,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.380]   is it's so easy to turn your worries to prayers.
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.420]   Like you can sit there in this unproductive,
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.760]   faithless waste of time, and you can worry, worry, worry,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.120]   worry, worry, or you can say, God,
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.120]   now I'm not worrying but I'm talking to you.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.920]   One is I'm gonna be single forever and ever and ever
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.120]   and ever, and the other is God,
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.260]   please help me to get married.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.400]   One is I really want the job,
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.360]   I'm never gonna have a job,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.720]   and how am I gonna pay for the rent,
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.640]   and oh my goodness, what's gonna happen?
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.480]   The other is God, can you handle that?
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.960]   And they look very similar, one's worrying, one's praying.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.320]   You have the power as a follower of Jesus Christ
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.160]   with his Holy Spirit to turn worries into prayers.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.480]   And so this clock, it's winding down
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.160]   and we must pray these prayers like we're at war.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.940]   That's Peter's writing this at wartime.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.640]   Christians are being persecuted.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.760]   I've heard it said with this illustration
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.560]   that often our prayers are like
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.680]   we're calling for room service.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.500]   We're dialing up God according to our preferences,
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.760]   whatever we feel like, and we call in and say,
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.960]   hey, would you please send me this?
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.800]   Would you move me here?
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.480]   Would you come and fluff my pillow
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.640]   and I'd like chocolate cake?
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.720]   And whatever we want, would you do this like room service?
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.840]   And in reality, prayer is much more like a walkie talkie
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.960]   with our commander in chief as we're moving into battle.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.200]   God, I'm moving towards this Starbucks.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.720]   What do you have for me to do?
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.840]   Who's in here?
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.720]   What divine appointments do you have
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.880]   for me to move into?
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.560]   Whose lives do you want me to change?
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.840]   God, I'm moving, walking through my apartment complex
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.760]   and I see my neighbor.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.440]   How would you like me to engage them?
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.260]   Where am I going?
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.100]   What am I doing?
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.000]   What do you have for me today?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.800]   God, as I move into work and I'm walking past this cube,
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.280]   who would you like me to engage?
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.240]   What do you want me to do?
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.320]   What conversations do you want me to have?
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.660]   That's wartime prayers.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.880]   That's prayers with a sober mind.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.680]   These are the prayers of a sane person.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.320]   Verse eight, above all, he says,
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.360]   love each other deeply.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.320]   It's the Greek ecthenos.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.680]   Love each other deeply, that word deeply,
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.160]   it's the word that we use is stretched out like an athlete,
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.920]   like an athlete crossing the finish line,
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.160]   stretches out to cross that finish line
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.000]   or stretches muscles in a way
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.080]   that are uncomfortably productive,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.960]   that you would stretch out yourself and love others
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.480]   in a way that is more than you're comfortable
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.580]   doing naturally.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:01.920]   Because love covers over a multitude of sins.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:09.140]   It is not, it's not saying that it is blind to faults,
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.000]   but it sees faults and accepts the faults of others.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.200]   It's not in ignoring those faults,
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.760]   which is unloving.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.080]   It's saying that's not right, but I still love you.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.720]   Not because I love you, I'll call that right.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.560]   There's a difference.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.160]   It's not saying, hey, because I love you
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.480]   and love covers over a multitude of sins,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.520]   I won't acknowledge that that's sin.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.840]   It's saying because I love you,
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.720]   I'm going to acknowledge your sin
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.420]   and love you in spite of your sin.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.000]   I'm going to take you in as a sinner.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.720]   Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.800]   Without grumbling, we show hospitality.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.860]   If you want to practice this, get a truck.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.440]   Because people will call you
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.760]   and they will offer you a six-pack and pizza
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.480]   to help you move, ask you to help them move,
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.160]   and you will have lots of opportunities
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.220]   to serve without grumbling.
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.440]   That we invite people, and keep in mind
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.400]   when Peter wrote this that Christians
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.960]   were being persecuted in such a way
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.880]   that they needed to rely on the love
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.920]   of each other for survival.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.560]   Like they would have to hide in each other's houses
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.080]   and places and take strangers in and feed them
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.600]   so that they wouldn't be killed or persecuted.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.000]   And this is the world that we live in now.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.680]   This kind of love is dying, that we would show
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.240]   this kind of love to one another.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.020]   And so my second point is we're to love without limits.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.280]   Peter is telling us there should be no limits to your love.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.960]   And this happened in the first and second century.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.380]   In fact, Tertullian wrote this in the second century.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.040]   In his defense of Christians, he's talking about
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   how pagans had taken notice to the way
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.000]   Christians love each other.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.940]   He wrote, "What marks us in the eyes of our enemies,
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.140]   "in the eyes of our enemies, is our loving kindness.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:11.140]   "Only look," they say, "how they love one another."
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.800]   And the love in this text, it's the word agapeo.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.920]   It's the verb form of the noun most of you have heard of,
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.620]   agape, agape love.
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.380]   It is a self-sacrificing, it's a word,
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.740]   the closest English word we have for it is charity.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.420]   It's giving and expecting nothing in return.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.880]   It's that kind of love, that you would extend love
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.960]   to someone and expect them to do nothing for you in return.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.860]   Agape, and so maybe you've heard of that word, agape, before,
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.520]   but I'd love to teach you something about that word.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.820]   Did you know that that word did not exist
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.860]   until someone had to describe the love
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.920]   that God followers had for each other?
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.060]   Okay, 800 years before Christ shows up on the scene,
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.580]   Homer, we see him introduce the word agapeo.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.940]   And that's this love that a mother would have for her child.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.140]   It's a sacrificing, hey, I'll do anything for you
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.960]   kind of love, I'll compromise my comforts for you
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.960]   kind of love, take my life for your life kind of love.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.220]   And then when these Christians, about 100 years around
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.120]   when Jesus is showing up on the scene,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.620]   God followers, they have to describe them,
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.580]   and they don't have a word.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.020]   They're like, the way that they love each other,
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.980]   we don't have a word for that.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.920]   There's no word for the way that these people
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.680]   who claim to know the creator of the universe,
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.040]   we can't describe the love that they have for each other.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.860]   And then in the Greek Bible, we see the word agape show up.
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.220]   They invented a word.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.760]   A word was invented to describe
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.700]   how Christians love each other.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.160]   It's like, what are we doing?
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.300]   We don't know what that's called.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.060]   See, the marketing plan for Christianity,
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.360]   it's really simple.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.620]   It's people showing extreme, out of this world,
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.420]   kindness to others as they carry forth the gospel.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.840]   And this is the breakdown of Christianity.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.820]   It's the misunderstanding of this.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.260]   It's the neglecting of this command.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.420]   Like, you can just think about it
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.480]   in the context of how we date.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.140]   That we take this idea of love
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.220]   and we make it this extreme emotional thing.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.380]   We say, I love you.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.700]   And what we really mean is the most selfish,
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.020]   fulfilling thing that I can do
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.820]   is express these feelings of emotion towards you
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.940]   and take from you everything I can that validates myself.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.220]   There's nothing selfless about that.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:44.000]   Because what would this self-sacrificing love do?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.700]   It would be like, hey, I love you,
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.380]   and so I'm not going to do
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.420]   what I feel like doing towards you.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.300]   Rather, I'm going to discipline myself
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.060]   in an act of dying to my flesh
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.340]   for the sake of verb, loving, serving, caring for,
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.340]   helping you without complaining, without rumbling.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:15.020]   I remember when Monica and I got married,
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:21.860]   she had inherited, through a breakup with an ex-boyfriend,
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.180]   she had gotten a Rottweiler in the split, okay?
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.220]   So they had purchased a dog together.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.260]   And they broke up and she got the dog
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.340]   and then we dated and ultimately got married
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.780]   and her parents got the dog.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.740]   And we eventually bought a house, a beautiful home.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.580]   I was really excited about it.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.500]   I wasn't in ministry at the time
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.020]   and we kind of bought this house
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.540]   that was our dream house at the time
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.780]   and it had these gorgeous hardwood floors that I loved.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.620]   And Lexus is the Rottweiler's name
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.940]   and Monica's parents would come and stay with us.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.500]   And year two of marriage was a rough one
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.060]   and her parents would come and stay with us
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:00.980]   and they would bring Lexus
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.540]   and Lexus didn't like to be outside,
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.020]   so Lexus would sleep inside.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.660]   And Lexus didn't like to get her toenails cut.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.140]   And so Lexus had these gnarly long toenails
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.860]   and she would run all over my hardwood floors.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.900]   And she'd try to stop around the corners
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.340]   and she'd just slide into the refrigerator
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.740]   and I would just like, oh,
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.860]   I'd cringe at the sound of her claws
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.820]   digging into my brand new hand-scraped hardwood floors.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.120]   And one day we had just gotten into it, her and I,
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.260]   which was very common for the second year of marriage.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.540]   We'd been married 12 years over a decade since then
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.500]   by God's grace.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.900]   And on this particular day, we were just into it
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.700]   and I'm like, your parents, I mean, they just,
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.540]   this is not fair.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.340]   I felt so justified in my frustration with this dog.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.820]   And I left the house and I called this guy
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.780]   that was discipling me.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.060]   I was a brand new Christian
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.680]   and this guy was pouring into my life.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.900]   And I'm telling him, the full vent to my anger
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.900]   towards her parents and this dog
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.980]   that's the ex-boyfriend's dog
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.820]   who doesn't like his toenails cut
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.100]   and eats Cheerios and milk for breakfast,
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.540]   which is a whole nother story.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.500]   And I'm just saying, I was scratching up all my hardwoods
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.820]   and he just says, do you love your in-laws?
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.140]   I remember I'm walking through Home Depot,
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.060]   just full vent to the anger,
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.540]   didn't have anywhere else to go, Home Depot.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.260]   [congregation laughing]
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.220]   And says, do you love your in-laws?
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.220]   What do you mean?
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.540]   Of course, yes, I love my in-laws.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.980]   She said, okay, because it sounds like
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.460]   you love your hardwoods more.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.860]   I'm like, shut up.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.100]   [congregation laughing]
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.420]   Why would you say such a terrible thing?
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.140]   And he's just saying, he's saying this verse,
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:53.140]   love covers a multitude of sins, of wrongdoings.
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:59.940]   It overlooks offenses, not in an enabling kind of way,
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.300]   but I'm gonna love you in spite of kind of way.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.760]   I think probably the greatest journey
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.540]   that you could start on tonight
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.900]   outside of following Jesus,
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.860]   or becoming a follower of Jesus,
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.820]   would be loving people in the name of Jesus.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.540]   It's the greatest adventure available to us
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.380]   on the planet Earth.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.260]   It's really fun.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.660]   Like Monica and I, we have a blast just listening
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.660]   to the needs of others and secretly meeting those needs.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.060]   It's a blast.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.100]   I mean, just hearing folks, like listening,
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.380]   like leaning into, what did you say they needed?
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.420]   Oh, they want, but they can't afford what?
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.940]   Okay, that's interesting, we'll pray for them.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.620]   [laughing]
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.780]   It's like we're Batman.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:44.940]   I mean, that's what it feels like.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.220]   You know, we're vigilantes taking things in our own hands,
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.100]   anonymously meeting the needs of others.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.060]   This is what Christians do.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:51.900]   It's what we can do.
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.380]   You can start doing that tonight.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.060]   Just listening to the needs of others and moving in
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.660]   and loving them in spite of their wrongs
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.180]   or how irresponsible they've been.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.140]   You can just care for them and love them
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.820]   and show Christ's grace to them
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.740]   because the greatest example of this kind of love
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.340]   that we have is the gospel.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.700]   It is that Christ covers, literally atones for,
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.900]   covers our sins, loves us in spite of our sins.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.740]   First John 4:10 says, "This is love, not that we loved God,
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:25.040]   "but that he loved us and sent his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.260]   "as an atoning or covering sacrifice for our sins."
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.140]   First John 3:16 says, "This is how we know what love is.
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.060]   "Jesus Christ laid down his life for us
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.060]   "and we ought to lay down our lives
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.860]   "for our brothers and sisters."
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.900]   And so this text is saying that we're to do this
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.740]   without grumbling and complaining,
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.660]   to be sensitive to the needs of others,
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.240]   to use the gift of hospitality.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.580]   Some of you have that gift,
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.100]   that you would use it without grumbling and serve the body.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.700]   My friend Katie, who served at the porch here,
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.560]   she literally purchased a house
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.660]   and she's this amazing cook.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.540]   Like she loved to cook and bake
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.020]   and she would throw these huge epic parties
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.620]   and she'd invite homeless people in and porch volunteers in
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.220]   and friends from the neighborhood in
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.020]   and strangers from the neighborhood in
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.820]   and her house would just be full of people
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.700]   that she would feed and care and love
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.020]   and share the gospel with.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.340]   It's such an incredible use of the gift of hospitality
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.460]   that the kingdom would move forward on that.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.340]   Verse 10, "Each of you should use
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.500]   "whatever gifts you have received to serve others
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:35.420]   "as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms."
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.060]   I've got three children, Presley 10, Finley 8, Weston 4
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.300]   and my 10 and eight year old, I talk to them all the time.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.020]   I'm like, "Hey, your gifts," in their language,
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.860]   they're believers, they've trusted in Christ
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.700]   and so I talk to them, "Hey, your gifts,
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.620]   "they're like superpowers."
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.420]   And they're like, "Well, what do you mean?"
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.420]   I'm like, "Man, you can talk to somebody today.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.080]   "You can encourage them, you can serve them
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.520]   "in a way that will literally change their life,
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.340]   "change their day, change their countenance,
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.940]   "soften their heart, it will remove hate
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.420]   "and replace it with love.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.320]   "Like you can change a human being
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.020]   "by the way you use these gifts.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.100]   "That's so much more valuable than being able to fly
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:20.100]   "or see through things, that you can talk to someone,
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:25.040]   "partnered with God and change their eternal destination.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.360]   "They will pass from going to hell to going to heaven
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.980]   "through you, God, working through you using your gifts."
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.580]   They're like superpowers.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:42.540]   If anyone speaks, they should do so
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.800]   as one who speaks the very words of God.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.700]   If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.620]   God provides so that in all things,
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.140]   God may be praised through Jesus Christ.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:57.140]   To him be the glory and the power forever and ever, amen.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:05.500]   Saint, we're steward of God's gifts.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.140]   He breaks them down into two categories,
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.860]   speaking and serving, words and actions.
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.480]   These are the ways that we can express gifts
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.140]   through words and actions.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.760]   And he's saying this word here, it's the word steward.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.180]   It's like someone who is responsible
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.960]   for like taking care of a house.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.900]   The house and the possessions in the house aren't theirs,
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.340]   but they take care of them as though they were theirs.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.760]   They steward them.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.740]   It's like this, it's like FedEx at Christmas.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.980]   You send gifts through FedEx at Christmas.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.780]   They steward those gifts.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.700]   They take them to where they belong.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.180]   You would be outraged if they sat there
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.780]   and they just started collecting them and open them in.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.820]   The person driving the FedEx truck just kind of like,
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.380]   "Look at all my gifts," and starts tearing into them
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.340]   like they're his gifts.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.820]   He'd be like, "No, those aren't your gifts.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.460]   "I gave you those to steward."
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.580]   So did God.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.420]   He gave you gifts to steward.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.540]   They weren't for you to try to make as much money
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.180]   as you could possibly have and pursue as much pleasure
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.900]   as you could possibly get and buy as many things
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.740]   as you can collect.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.620]   That's not why he gave you those gifts.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:21.940]   You're a steward of those gifts.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:29.020]   And so glorify, my third point, glorify God with your gifts.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.340]   It says in verse 10, "You are a steward of God's grace
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.980]   "in its various forms, both speaking and serving,
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.980]   "talking about speaking, words of encouragement."
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.420]   It says it's like being the literal mouthpiece of God.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:47.980]   That when Christ wants to encourage someone with words,
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.860]   he often uses Christ's followers, his followers,
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.340]   to speak encouraging words to others.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.380]   There's power in this that you may not even been aware of.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:03.060]   I think of my grandmother.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:09.100]   When I was growing up, she would look at me
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.500]   with the most sincerity and say,
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.220]   "How's my mighty man of God?"
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:18.780]   It was just sweet, you know, when you're four and six,
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.420]   and she would always see me, we'd go to her house on Sundays,
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.260]   she'd say, "How's my mighty man of God?"
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.060]   And I can't, like, those words,
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.020]   like, they put me on a trajectory
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.460]   that was really powerful.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.540]   I'm not trying to get weird on you or anything,
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.620]   but it just seemed like that they were shifting me.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.500]   And so when I'm 16 and I start getting high,
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.940]   you know, start smoking weed, and then I start partying,
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.460]   and then I start entering into relationships
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.540]   and doing things that I know I shouldn't be doing,
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.300]   and we go to her house and I see her,
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.720]   and she'd say, "How's my mighty man of God?
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.440]   "How's my mighty man of God?"
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.040]   Like, it's fine when I'm six,
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.200]   but when I'm 16 and I'm 18,
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.000]   I know I'm not walking with the Lord,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.040]   and she's just sitting there speaking this over me,
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.080]   "How's my mighty man of God?"
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.360]   And it's like, it's like it was,
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.160]   that was the beginning of a calling in the ministry.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.680]   I know that's weird, but it's like,
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.380]   that's what God was doing through my frail grandmother.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.920]   Using those words, "How's my mighty man of God?"
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.340]   That's the gift of encouragement.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.300]   You know people that you love to be around
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.100]   because of how encouraging they are.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:33.220]   Encouragers, you encourage, you have this power
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.380]   to change someone's day or their outlook
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.460]   or even their life.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.340]   And he says, "If you serve, do so as a representative
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.800]   "of God's army, understanding that it's by his grace
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.100]   "that you serve," right?
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:50.100]   I think of my friend Morgan, who serves as an assistant,
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.040]   administrative assistant to the young adult team.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.720]   Like she's always so positive,
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.460]   and whenever you encourage her, she's always like,
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.000]   "Oh, it's by God's grace," you know?
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.120]   And it's not this platitude or this cliche saying,
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.260]   like she believes it.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:05.040]   And it's just like Morgan's an amazing PR person for God.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.640]   She makes him look really, really good
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.080]   because she's constantly talking about the good things
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.700]   that he's doing through her.
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.700]   She is soberly aware that it is God doing those good things.
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.720]   If you were here for the Church Leaders Conference,
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.680]   you heard Todd today talk about a time
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:27.580]   when he had the opportunity, he was just mopping a floor.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.780]   And he had the opportunity to do that
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.400]   for an audience of just God,
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.420]   or he could have lifted the shutters
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.000]   so that hundreds of people as they passed by
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.460]   would see him mopping the floors.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:45.080]   And he talked about how we do things for the glory of God,
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.120]   not for the praise of humans,
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.020]   not for the glory of self or the glory of man,
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.940]   that everything we do, we do for the glory of God,
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:59.440]   not needing something from people, but serving folks.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:04.720]   As I was talking with my kids this week,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.640]   and one of them was angry and sad,
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.640]   and I asked them, I knew I had been in this first,
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.400]   and I just asked them, "Hey, let me ask you a question."
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.760]   Like they were really frustrated,
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.640]   and just, I was having a hard time.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.640]   If you're ever just sad, you don't know why you're sad,
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.440]   that's a little bit what we were dealing with.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.560]   They're like, "I'm just sad, Dad."
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.400]   I'm like, "Why are you sad?"
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.600]   "I don't know why, I don't know why I'm sad."
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.280]   And that's tough, that's hard to parent, I'll be honest.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.480]   I said, "Let me ask you a question.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.080]   "How are you doing at serving?"
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.200]   And she said, "I don't know, I'm not what you mean."
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.760]   I'm like, "How are you doing at using your powers?
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.840]   "How are you doing at loving people,
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.520]   "encouraging people, and serving them?"
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.360]   I don't know.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.480]   And I said, "Let me tell you about
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.240]   "one of my favorite things when I was in Israel.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.020]   "When I was in Israel, there's a Sea of Galilee,
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.520]   "it's beautiful, it's full of life,
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.440]   "it's filled with fish, and it's surrounded
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.200]   "by greenery and flowers,
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.080]   "and all of these beautiful things to see.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.560]   "And so I love it."
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.280]   You can see why Jesus did so much ministry
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.600]   in the Sea of Galilee, and it was this thoroughfare
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.640]   from one city to the next, to the next, to the next.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.360]   And the Sea of Galilee, out of the Sea of Galilee
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.320]   flows the River Jordan, and the River Jordan
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.080]   flows down to what's called the Dead Sea.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.760]   Now the Dead Sea couldn't be more different
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.600]   than the Sea of Galilee.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.440]   There's nothing that grows around it,
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.960]   there's nothing that lives in it,
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.080]   there's no fish in it, it's completely dead.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:19.920]   Why?
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.160]   Because there's a river flowing into it
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.560]   and nothing flowing out of it.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.480]   The sun evaporates the water, it leaves behind the minerals,
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.740]   and nothing can grow in the Dead Sea,
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.180]   because it receives but it does not give.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:35.880]   And likewise, literally, you are dying, becoming,
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.200]   and I'm saying this not for shock value,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.300]   because I believe it's true, becoming mentally ill
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.860]   if you just receive and never give out.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.040]   You will become dead from the inside.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.920]   Every person that I've talked to that struggles
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.000]   with their thoughts and anxieties
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.080]   and obsessive, compulsive things,
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   they receive, it starts with being fixated on self and
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.780]   you just consume and never give out.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.920]   And you were not made to do that, you're a conduit.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.840]   You're a conduit.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.640]   You're a conduit of God's grace,
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.580]   that's what the scripture says,
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.980]   that you're giving and extending God's grace to others
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.500]   in the way that you serve them,
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.300]   through your words and through your actions.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:29.200]   And so next time you're sad,
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.960]   or angry,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.600]   or frustrated, or focused on yourself,
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.660]   are you building up walls of worry,
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.420]   or are you turning thoughts into prayers
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.500]   as though you're running out of time in the last days?
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:50.180]   What I'm trying to tell you is your bucket list
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.820]   is not about how many things you can experience
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.140]   or places you can go.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.500]   It's not like, hey, what do I need to do?
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.820]   What parts of the world do I need to see?
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:05.220]   It's how can I pray with a great, sane mind,
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.860]   with sobriety, and how can I love
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.540]   in a way that's stretched out, uncomfortably,
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.180]   giving my life away, and how can I serve,
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.660]   sharing the gifts that God has entrusted to me with others
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.380]   in the way that I speak words of encouragement over them,
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.500]   in the way that I serve them, and help them,
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.780]   and am hospitable to them, expecting nothing in return,
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.340]   because while you might think you have the day,
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.820]   one day, much sooner than you think,
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.580]   you are going to have your last day.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:39.660]   You are going to be out of time.
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.900]   Done.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.900]   Nothing else.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.900]   Nothing else you can give.
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.900]   And I don't know if it's because Jesus comes back
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:55.900]   or you just don't breathe,
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.900]   but what are you going to do with your life?
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.900]   Make a million dollars before you're 30?
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.900]   Some of you, it's too late.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.900]   It's too late.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:16.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.900]   I don't know if the plans in your life
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.900]   have gone the way you thought they would.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.900]   I don't know.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.900]   What are you going to do with your life?
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.900]   Do you really believe there's a God?
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:28.900]   Do you really believe there's a God?
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.900]   Do you really believe there's a God?
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.900]   Do you really believe there's a creator,
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.900]   the heavens and the earth, and he has plans for you,
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.900]   he's numbered your days, he knows how long you live,
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.900]   when you die, he's the only one that knows
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.900]   when Christ comes back.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.900]   Do you really believe that?
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.900]   Do you really believe that your salvation
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.900]   cost him his son on a cross?
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.900]   And he goes into the grave and he defeats death
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.900]   and raises back, giving you hope
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.900]   and a promise for eternal life.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:57.900]   Do you really believe that?
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.900]   Do you really believe that?
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.900]   Do you live like you believe that?
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.900]   How are you doing at this bucket list of Christianity?
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.900]   When you came in, you got a porch news,
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.900]   would you grab that for me?
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.900]   The porch news, the little thing they handed you
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.900]   when you came in?
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:12.900]   Would you grab that for me?
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.900]   It's where you all move and you grab it.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.900]   Some of you are like, what did he say?
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.900]   It's got a list on the back, what I'd love for you to do.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.900]   I'd love 100% unanimous participation in this.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   It's a really simple ask.
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.900]   Would you just take time to fill that out?
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.900]   Things that you want to do before now
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.900]   and Christ takes you home.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.900]   You may think in terms of categories of praying
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:45.900]   with a sober mind, loving bigger than you're comfortable
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.900]   and sharing the gifts that God has entrusted
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.900]   to you with others.
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.900]   To him be the glory and the power forever and ever,
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.900]   amen it says.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.900]   Amen is a word you use probably all the time
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.900]   but you may not know what it means.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.900]   It means so be it.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.900]   Peter's saying there's going to be an amen
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.900]   to all things as you know.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.900]   There's going to be a so be it moment
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.900]   to the world as you know it.
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.900]   Your bucket list is to pray with perspective,
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:17.900]   to love without limits and to give your gifts
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.900]   for God's glory.
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.900]   These aren't things to do before you die.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:26.900]   They are things to do or else you're literally dying.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.900]   They're the essence of living as a Christ follower.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.900]   To live as a Christian is to give your life to Christ.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.900]   It's the greatest commandment, love God
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.900]   with all your heart, soul, mind and strength
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.900]   and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.900]   He says I can summarize all of the law in this action
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.900]   that you give your life to God and to people.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:52.900]   I'll wrap up with this.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.900]   Let's see, I've been on staff for 11 years
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.900]   so about 11 years ago, 10 years ago,
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.900]   I'd just come on staff and Todd, senior pastor here,
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.900]   pulled me aside and just said hey,
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.900]   there's a man who died and he has two sons
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.900]   who are both young adults that survived him
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.900]   and I'm going to go meet with him
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:10.900]   because I'm going to do his funeral.
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:11.900]   Would you like to go along?
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.900]   I didn't know Todd well at all and I'm like
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.900]   of course man, any time with you, let's go.
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.900]   We get in his car and we're driving down the road
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.900]   and we're driving in the part of town,
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:20.900]   the really nice part of town,
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.900]   really nice part of Dallas if you're listening
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.900]   and this is the part where there's like huge houses
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.900]   inside the city limits but not just huge houses,
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.900]   huge houses on huge lots of lands like estates
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.900]   and I'm like wow, who is this guy?
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.900]   You know and we pull up to this gate
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.900]   and the gate kind of opens slowly
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.900]   and we drive down this cobblestone road
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.900]   and we get to this, you know,
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.900]   we pull up to this house about seven or eight
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.900]   and I yell to the, no, we get to this house
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:55.900]   and it is huge white house with these big pillars
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.900]   and the yard looks like the arboretum
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.900]   like there's just flowers and manicured lawns
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.900]   and it's crazy and we go inside
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.900]   and on the wall, I'm not kidding,
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.900]   there's like Rembrandts and Monets,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.900]   these huge paintings, like just incredible paintings
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.900]   and I'm walking and everything in the house is amazing
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.900]   and we sit down with these two sons
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.900]   in their 20s in their mourning,
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:17.900]   they just lost their father
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.900]   and we're talking to them and I noticed,
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.900]   you know, as we talk and we're sharing the gospel
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.900]   and we're having these conversations about their dad
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.900]   and their dad, they tell us, you know,
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.900]   he became a Christian late in his life
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.900]   and he became a devoted follower of Jesus
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:32.900]   kind of in his last days
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.900]   and I noticed that in the midst of all
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.900]   of the really nice paintings and large pieces of furniture,
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.900]   there were Post-it notes, yellow Post-it notes.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.900]   I said, hey, let me ask you a question.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.900]   What's up with the Post-it notes?
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.900]   And one of them said, oh man, when dad,
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.900]   when dad found out he was dying,
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:57.900]   he just wanted to be surrounded with the word of God.
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.900]   He wanted people to encourage him
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.900]   with the truth of God through the scriptures,
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.900]   to speak the words of God to him
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.900]   and he asked us to put verses all over the house,
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.900]   these Post-it notes.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.900]   What else?
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.900]   Oh man, he just wanted to share Christ with everybody.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.900]   Like in his last days, he would have us invite people over
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.900]   so he could share the gospel with them
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.900]   and he would call his nurses in his room
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:28.900]   to share the gospel and his doctors,
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.900]   he would say, hey, let me just talk to you for a minute
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.900]   and he would tell them about how they were created
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.900]   by a God who loves them, separated from him by their sin
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.900]   and that he had sent his only son, Jesus Christ,
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.900]   to die for their sins.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.900]   He just was sharing the gospel with everybody he could.
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:44.900]   Wow, what else?
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.900]   What else?
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.900]   Well, dad, he was a really well-resourced man.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.900]   Like yeah, no kidding.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.900]   And when he found out he was dying,
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.900]   he just wanted to give it all away
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.900]   and in fact, he became really frustrated.
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.900]   He had asked us to call over attorneys
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.900]   because he had locked all of his money up in trust
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.900]   and had assigned a power of attorney to someone
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.900]   and it took a lot of paperwork and processes
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.900]   to even liquidate his money
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:20.900]   and he just wanted to give it all away.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.900]   He was frustrated that he couldn't do that.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.900]   What else?
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.900]   What else?
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.900]   And they looked at each other and they laughed
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.900]   and they looked at us and they said,
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.900]   well, people thought he was crazy.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.900]   Why?
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:38.900]   Why did they think he was crazy?
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.900]   Because he'd sit up in his bed and he'd tell us,
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.900]   he'd stare straight through us and he'd say,
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.900]   don't wait, don't wait like I did.
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.900]   Don't you wait, don't wait.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.900]   And they didn't know what he was talking about,
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.900]   but we knew.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.900]   See, in his last days, dad knew what it meant
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.900]   to live as a person following Jesus.
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.900]   He started to get the bucket list
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.900]   that Peter's talking about.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.900]   You can learn a lot from a man
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.900]   who is sitting on his deathbed.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.900]   What are you gonna do with your life?
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.900]   You gonna waste it on you?
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.900]   What are you gonna do with your life?
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.900]   Don't wait.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.900]   Don't wait like he did.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.900]   The end of all things is near.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.900]   Let me pray.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.900]   And Father, we thank you for this truth
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.900]   through your servant Peter.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:41.900]   For the reminder that you've given us.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.900]   And Lord, we just ask that as we read these words,
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.900]   that not in a manipulative way
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.900]   or just a motivating way,
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:54.900]   that tomorrow we would wake up
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.900]   and we would search the scriptures
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:57.900]   and wonder what you have for us
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.900]   and that we would take the activities
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.900]   that we're involved in
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:02.900]   and the things that we scheduled.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.900]   And Lord, the things that are not consistent
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.900]   with what you want us to do,
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.900]   we'd reprioritize.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.900]   Would you help us reprioritize?
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.900]   Would you help us to pray with sober minds?
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.900]   Help us to love in ways that are uncomfortable?
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.900]   And help us to share the gifts
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.900]   that you've entrusted to us
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.900]   for the common good of the brotherhood and sisterhood
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   for Christians everywhere.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.900]   And Lord, we thank you for this text.
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.900]   And would you change us through it?
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.900]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
