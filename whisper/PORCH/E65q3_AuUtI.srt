1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,980
 - Welcome to The Porch!

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,040
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
 How you guys doing?

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,520
 Come on, how was the break?

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,360
 I love it.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,040
 Hey, if you're a first time with us, my name's JP.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,900
 I get to serve with the young adults here

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,700
 as we seek to change this city.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,040
 And so what did you guys do over the break?

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,880
 - Everything!

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,160
 - Everything, no you didn't.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,480
 Work, I heard it, yep.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,200
 Someone went to Haiti.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,440
 Anybody here went to Haiti?

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,480
 (audience cheering)

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,200
 Yeah, it's fun, it's great times, man.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
 Hey, if you're here for the first time,

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,160
 I hope, you know, people are still getting here.

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,880
 They're still circling the parking lot.

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,160
 And so get here early, we're glad you're here.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,560
 We're glad you made it in.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,720
 I, over the break, one thing that I did,

24
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,900
 lots of things, lots of fun.

25
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,360
 I got to go to Haiti with some of my friends.

26
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,560
 But one thing I did was I taught my girls,

27
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,840
 I've got two, Presley and Finley and little boy Weston,

28
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,000
 but I taught my girls how to ride a bike.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,520
 Do you guys remember learning how to ride a bike?

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,400
 Probably not because you were like four, okay?

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,400
 And so my daughter's eight, which makes me a terrible dad.

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,320
 And so I tried four years ago, but it didn't go so well.

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,640
 And so, you know, let me kind of paint the picture.

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,440
 Four years ago, there's this big sidewalk by our house.

35
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,760
 We get her a brand new bike.

36
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,660
 She's excited.

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,880
 We do the Christmas thing in the video and she walks out.

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,700
 She wants a bike.

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,900
 She sees a bicycle.

40
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,320
 She sees it, she goes crazy.

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,560
 Let's go learn how to ride it.

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,880
 We go outside, you know,

43
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,600
 then I do what all the commercials tell you to do, right?

44
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,400
 I'm kind of running behind her, you know,

45
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,880
 holding her on the bike.

46
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,680
 She's pedaling, everything's going great.

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,400
 And I let her go, just like the commercial says,

48
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,000
 she falls over and then she just kind of has

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,280
 these big crocodile tears and kind of looks,

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,720
 she's like, you did this to me, you know?

51
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,080
 And I'm like, no, it's gonna be okay, you know?

52
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,000
 That wasn't supposed to happen.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 You're supposed to pedal and keep going.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,280
 And so then I'm like, well, let's get back.

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,520
 No, never again.

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,640
 And so that was for the past four years.

57
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,920
 We've been kind of sitting in that.

58
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,680
 And I'll be like, hey, she'll be like,

59
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,320
 I really want to ride the bike.

60
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
 And I'm like, okay, well, let's go.

61
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,840
 And I'm gonna show you, no, never.

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,060
 Well, I'm like, well, you can't ride the bike

63
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,960
 unless I teach you how to ride the bike.

64
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,720
 And she's like, well, I just wanna ride the bike.

65
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,120
 I don't wanna learn how to ride the bike.

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,000
 I just wanna be on the bike.

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,040
 She has all the desire to do the skill,

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,060
 but she doesn't wanna put in the work.

69
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,640
 She has all the desire to be there,

70
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,760
 like all of her friends, everybody in the world,

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,720
 every eighth grader, I mean, every eight-year-old ever born

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,240
 can ride a bike, except for her.

73
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,560
 And it's just because her dad doesn't know how to teach her.

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,440
 And she's afraid to learn,

75
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,200
 and she doesn't wanna make that transition.

76
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,080
 And as I think about that,

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,520
 I think about my own transition into the real world.

78
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,520
 It was like high school, big man on campus, college,

79
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,400
 all of the freedom that the world offers,

80
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,380
 but none of the maturity to navigate that freedom.

81
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,440
 I mean, I'm hanging out with guys who grunt as a language

82
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,560
 and hanging out with girls who like guys

83
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,800
 who grunt as a language, right?

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,040
 And so, and it's like,

85
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,180
 these are who I'm supposed to learn how to be an adult with.

86
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,560
 And then transition into the real world

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,540
 and kind of get there and like, "Whoa, that sucks.

88
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,760
 (congregation laughing)

89
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,260
 "What is, that hurt.

90
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,220
 "I don't like, like I've gotta work for,

91
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,080
 "I've gotta set an alarm clock and get up and stuff.

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,720
 "No, thank you."

93
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,920
 And it's like, no one was there to kind of teach me

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,760
 and instruct me.

95
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,440
 And so then what happens is we go through our minds,

96
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,720
 it's like, "Well, I'm gonna go back and back to school,

97
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,700
 "take the GMAT and do that for a little bit longer.

98
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,380
 "I don't wanna push through this,

99
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,000
 "whatever this terrible, awful experience is.

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,440
 "I mean, I'll go back home and be with mom and dad

101
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,860
 "or some, I don't wanna keep going.

102
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,100
 "I don't wanna grow up before my time.

103
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,900
 "And I'm not gonna beat you guys up tonight

104
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,760
 "because you know what they're saying.

105
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,760
 "You know what they're saying about us,

106
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,640
 "this whole delayed adolescence thing.

107
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
 "It's not very nice."

108
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,640
 A New York Times just put out an article,

109
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,460
 I'll read this quote to you, it says,

110
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,100
 "Today's 25-year-olds compared

111
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,620
 "with their parents' generation at the same age

112
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,840
 "are twice as likely to still be students,

113
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,560
 "only half as likely to be married,

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,980
 "and 50% more likely to be receiving financial assistance

115
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,280
 "from their parents."

116
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,200
 And so just in case you missed those details,

117
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,880
 50% more likely to still be in school,

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
 50% less likely to be married,

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,440
 and 50% more likely to be on parents' payroll.

120
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,640
 And so some of you, when I read that,

121
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,600
 here's what just went through your mind,

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,440
 "Not me, dude.

123
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,580
 "I'm banking, bro, you don't even know.

124
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,020
 (congregation laughing)

125
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,180
 "Parents' payroll, I support them, dog.

126
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,460
 (congregation laughing)

127
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,960
 "Rich young ruler, man."

128
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,960
 And so here's the deal, yeah, maybe so, maybe so,

129
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,700
 but you've got areas of your life

130
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,440
 that you don't have the maturity

131
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,220
 to support yourself spiritually.

132
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,540
 See, this world is a little bit more

133
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,880
 than knowing how to tie a tie,

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,300
 how to go through an interview,

135
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,840
 how to pay your bills on time.

136
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,680
 That's great that you're responsible.

137
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,340
 And so I don't have any desire tonight

138
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,520
 to teach you tips and tricks

139
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,180
 of actually being just a responsible citizen.

140
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,680
 I wanna show you what it means to grow in the faith,

141
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,960
 the thing that really matters.

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,760
 And so we're moving through this series we call adulting,

143
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,440
 kicking it off, 2016, great to be with you guys.

144
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,840
 Miss you like crazy.

145
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,780
 Prayed for you like crazy.

146
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,640
 And so tonight, we're talking about training to adult

147
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,240
 from the scripture, believe it or not.

148
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,680
 It actually talks about this.

149
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,360
 And so training to adult.

150
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,000
 And so it begs the question, what makes someone an adult?

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,140
 And so I asked that question.

152
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,440
 I asked the Facebook world,

153
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,480
 and I asked all my Twitter friends, all seven of you,

154
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,480
 and I kind of got these crazy answers.

155
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,800
 All of a sudden, you have to establish your own bedtime.

156
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,840
 That makes you an adult.

157
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,680
 Or as soon as you enter the workforce,

158
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,040
 you're thinking about a 401(k),

159
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,300
 and so saving for retirement evidently makes you,

160
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,880
 paying taxes was one thing they said.

161
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,040
 Saving money for rings, a house, a wedding, food,

162
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
 graduating from that ramen noodles thing.

163
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,800
 One person said, I feel most like an adult

164
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
 when I check my mail.

165
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,520
 And I was like, I just feel sad when I check my mail.

166
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,520
 But one person said, just having their own cell phone bill,

167
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,200
 or cell phone account.

168
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,680
 And I was like, that's just irresponsible.

169
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,600
 The family share plan, come on, man, what are you thinking?

170
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,080
 It's crazy to have your own cell.

171
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,160
 That doesn't make you an adult,

172
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,580
 that makes you a poor steward of God's resources.

173
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,200
 [congregation laughing]

174
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
 Somebody said jury duty, others said making their own doctors

175
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,040
 and dentist appointments.

176
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,760
 One girl said, changing my oil,

177
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,920
 which was really impressive to me.

178
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,400
 So I was like, whoa, you change your own oils?

179
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,720
 Like, yeah.

180
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
 I was like, man, that's incredible.

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,680
 I said, how did you learn how to do that?

182
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,440
 'Cause I don't know, man, one time I just,

183
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,060
 driving down the road, pulled into the oil change place,

184
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,900
 and it happened.

185
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,480
 I was like, oh, oh, okay.

186
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,400
 That's what you mean by changing your oil.

187
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,420
 That's, I'm there, that's different, okay?

188
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,680
 And so why is this so hard?

189
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,040
 Like, becoming an adult is like becoming a unicorn.

190
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,880
 It's like, who knows how to figure out how to do this?

191
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,560
 Like, where do they teach this?

192
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,520
 And so,

193
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,920
 and so tonight, as we talk about training to adult,

194
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,740
 I wanna talk about what it means to grow up on truth,

195
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,000
 what it means to train for godliness.

196
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,000
 And what it means before you leave here this evening

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,920
 to be an adult.

198
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,920
 And so, Paul wrote this letter in 1 Timothy.

199
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,360
 If you're new to the Bible, you can get there,

200
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,480
 turn to the New Testament,

201
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,080
 that's that shorter section in the back.

202
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,400
 You'll go through the gospels,

203
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,400
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans,

204
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,720
 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians,

205
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,700
 Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians,

206
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,480
 1 and 2 Thessalonians,

207
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,800
 1 and 2 Timothy, 1 Timothy, right there.

208
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,320
 And so, this is what's called the pastoral epistle.

209
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
 And the reason epistle just means letter,

210
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,560
 it's a letter to a pastor.

211
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,480
 Paul wrote it to Timothy.

212
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,840
 Paul is Timothy's spiritual father.

213
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
 Timothy had a father wound, he didn't have a good dad.

214
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,780
 We don't know much about his dad,

215
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,400
 but we know that his mom is accredited in the scriptures,

216
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
 and his grandmother,

217
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,320
 and so we don't know much about his father,

218
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,400
 but he probably had an absent father,

219
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,920
 and so Paul steps into the equation as his spiritual father,

220
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,120
 and he's gonna exhort him.

221
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,800
 And so, Timothy's about 25 to 35 years old

222
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,120
 when Paul writes this to him,

223
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,680
 and he's going to take over

224
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,200
 the largest church in the world, the church in Ephesus.

225
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,280
 So, this is kind of a big responsibility.

226
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,000
 He's graduating from, you know,

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,500
 the, I won't say childhood,

228
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,520
 but we'll say adolescence to adulthood,

229
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,400
 where he's going to lead leaders.

230
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,000
 And so, Paul writes this letter to him,

231
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,160
 and so that he might apply it to his life.

232
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,260
 And so, today, a couple thousand years later,

233
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,740
 we can apply it to our lives

234
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,800
 as we talk about training to adults.

235
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
 So, verse six, 1 Timothy chapter four, verse six.

236
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,760
 He says, "If you point these things out

237
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,280
 "to the brothers and sisters,

238
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,800
 "you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus."

239
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,720
 And so, what are these things?

240
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,240
 As we started at a weird spot, a weird place in the text,

241
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,040
 he's saying, "Hey, some are going to leave the faith."

242
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,680
 Tell me that ain't relevant to where you're at.

243
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,920
 Like, you didn't go to college.

244
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,800
 Like, all of a sudden, you're in vacation Bible school.

245
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,640
 Praise, he came from heaven to.

246
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
 And then you go to college,

247
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,560
 and there's keg stands, and fraternity parties,

248
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,500
 and looking for the next thing, and all.

249
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,900
 It's like, God, oh yeah, no, I'm a Christian,

250
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,200
 but there's no anything, any evidence.

251
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,740
 And so, you see people leaving the faith in droves.

252
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,240
 He says, "Hey, some are going to leave the faith."

253
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,360
 He says, "But if you point these things out

254
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,300
 "to the brothers and sisters,

255
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,740
 "you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus."

256
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,580
 And then he says this,

257
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,500
 "You will be nourished on the truths of the faith

258
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,500
 "and of the good teaching that you have followed,

259
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,160
 "have nothing to do with godless myths

260
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,440
 "and old wives' tales."

261
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,280
 So, there's two things.

262
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,260
 There's this kind of dichotomy in this text.

263
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,160
 There's the truths that you're to be nourished on,

264
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,500
 and then there's this false teaching

265
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,260
 these old wives' tales, okay, other ideas.

266
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,860
 So, truth and other ideas.

267
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,540
 And he's saying, "Hey, you need to hold fast to the truth."

268
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,320
 And so, that's my first point this evening.

269
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,540
 Grow up on truth.

270
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,080
 It says be nourished on truth.

271
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,320
 Feast on truth.

272
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,280
 Live on a diet of truth.

273
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,980
 Now, you're like, "Well, how's that relevant to me?"

274
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,880
 Because you don't know what's true.

275
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,260
 I didn't know what's true.

276
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,340
 Graduate from college, I mean, who defines your definition?

277
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,580
 Is it your anthropology teacher?

278
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,820
 Your biology teacher?

279
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
 Is it your boss that gets to define what's true?

280
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,020
 Is it your girlfriend, your boyfriend, your parents

281
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,320
 that gets to define what's true?

282
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,300
 No, God defines what's true.

283
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,060
 He created all truth.

284
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,220
 Absolutely.

285
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,660
 And so, if you process the decision

286
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,300
 with what's called a poor worldview,

287
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,840
 worldview is just what is real.

288
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,940
 It's the reality.

289
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,880
 Then you're not navigating this life

290
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,540
 as it was intended to be navigated.

291
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,540
 We have to find out, we have to play this game.

292
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,500
 Hey, what is true?

293
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,420
 We're not on a happiness journey.

294
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,260
 See, some of you are like,

295
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,500
 "Well, whatever makes you happy is true."

296
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,760
 False.

297
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,180
 We're not on a happiness journey.

298
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,180
 We're on a truth journey.

299
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,700
 We gotta find out what is absolutely true.

300
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,800
 And so, in verse six, he says, "Be nourished,"

301
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,220
 which is just a diet of, he's saying,

302
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,220
 "Feed yourself truth and good teaching."

303
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,420
 You can't grow in the faith

304
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,160
 unless you're feeding yourself truth and good teaching.

305
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,200
 He said that again.

306
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,040
 You cannot, it is an impossibility,

307
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,600
 grow in the faith unless you are feeding yourself

308
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,560
 truth and good teaching.

309
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,000
 I hope that's one of the reasons you're here,

310
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,160
 'cause we teach from the Scriptures.

311
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,720
 Why, even when we go topical,

312
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,920
 we start with a passage and begin to unpack

313
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,100
 what is in that passage

314
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,440
 so that you might learn the Scriptures,

315
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,620
 so that you can bring a Bible,

316
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,720
 so that you can take notes in there,

317
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,440
 and that you would know the Scripture.

318
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,080
 See, some of us, we redefine truth based on our experience.

319
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,460
 And that's a terrible practice,

320
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,140
 because no one wants to define truth.

321
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,240
 Or let me just say it like this.

322
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,900
 You shouldn't define truth when tragedy hits.

323
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,380
 You shouldn't be defining truth

324
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,340
 when you really, really, really, really want something.

325
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,800
 When you get in a situation where there's tragedy

326
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,380
 or a deep, deep, deep desire,

327
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,760
 you better already have a solid foundation of truth.

328
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,260
 Otherwise, your desires and your emotions

329
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,120
 are gonna direct you to a place

330
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,880
 that is full of deep despair.

331
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,260
 I see it all the time.

332
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,860
 Life is hard.

333
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,740
 The enemy, Satan, he's real, he's a liar.

334
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,320
 The world has this amazing PR department,

335
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,820
 and some of us are going through it, playing this game

336
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,480
 of what is the most convenient truth

337
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,220
 so that I can do whatever I want.

338
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,160
 But here he says, verse seven,

339
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,320
 "Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wise tales."

340
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,920
 What are the dumb lies that we believe?

341
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,760
 There's lots of them.

342
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,240
 I'll give you a few.

343
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,920
 We jotted down.

344
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,520
 Money will make you happy?

345
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,880
 No.

346
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,880
 There's a lot of suicidal billionaires,

347
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,900
 a lot of really depressed millionaires.

348
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,560
 A new job will make you happy?

349
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,140
 That's what you thought when you went into your last job.

350
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,440
 (congregation laughing)

351
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,720
 A new relationship will make you happy?

352
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,000
 I know new relationships that have made people

353
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,140
 really, really, really, really sad.

354
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,880
 The world says, "Hey, have sex whenever you're both ready."

355
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,120
 What does that even mean?

356
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,080
 I've been ready since the fifth grade.

357
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,500
 (congregation laughing)

358
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,040
 The world says, "All roads lead to God."

359
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,000
 Man, that does not have a happy ending.

360
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,600
 The world says, "Hey, pursue happily ever after."

361
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,440
 I don't think so.

362
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,920
 It says, "If it feels good, it must be right."

363
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,760
 No.

364
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,380
 It says, "If it's really difficult, it must be wrong."

365
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,500
 No, there's some things that are difficult

366
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,880
 that are worth pursuing.

367
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,520
 These are all lies that some of us believe

368
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,120
 and we get in a situation

369
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,520
 and we begin to process the outcome.

370
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,040
 And then we say, "Okay, what decision can I make

371
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,160
 "that will bring about the best outcome?"

372
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,040
 But sometimes God is saying,

373
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,560
 "No, you don't judge obedience by the outcome.

374
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,660
 "You judge obedience by my word.

375
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,500
 "The outcome might be death.

376
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
 "The outcome might be persecution.

377
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,000
 "The outcome might be pain, and it can still be right."

378
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,820
 You've got to judge obedience based on his word,

379
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,440
 not your perceived outcome.

380
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,960
 How will throw your critical thinking training in

381
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
 for a loop?

382
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,860
 We ask, "What is best for me?

383
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,240
 "Will it help me be a better me?"

384
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,800
 That's the wrong question.

385
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,880
 The right question is,

386
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,960
 "Will it help me be a better follower of Christ?

387
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,400
 "Will it help me be a better servant of God?"

388
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,700
 And so here's what I'm saying.

389
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,440
 Don't let popular opinion determine what is true.

390
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,920
 My friend Dave said it this way.

391
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,780
 "Something can be true even if no one knows it.

392
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,100
 "Something can be true even if no one admits it.

393
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,260
 "Something can be true even if no one agrees

394
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,560
 "with what it is.

395
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,160
 "Something can be true even if no one follows it.

396
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,560
 "And something can be true even if no one

397
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,760
 "but God grasps it fully."

398
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,580
 When I was coming back from Haiti,

399
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,120
 I was on the airplane, sat next to an individual,

400
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,440
 began to engage with him for the purpose of

401
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,660
 just finding out what he believes and sharing the gospel.

402
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,160
 And we had a great conversation about that.

403
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,460
 He was a man of some faith,

404
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,860
 but didn't quite have assurance of salvation,

405
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,980
 wasn't certain he was gonna be with God forever.

406
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,780
 And so we began to talk about that.

407
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,180
 And I asked him what he did.

408
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,660
 He self-identified as a functional doctor.

409
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,860
 He was indeed a doctor,

410
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,260
 but instead of prescribing traditional medicine,

411
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,180
 he would look at lifestyle, diet, and fitness,

412
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,340
 or exercise, if you will.

413
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,060
 And so we were talking about this,

414
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,500
 and he said he had seen many diseases

415
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,060
 that modern medicine said couldn't be cured.

416
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,120
 He saw them cured simply by people changing their lifestyle.

417
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,040
 And as we talked more about that,

418
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,600
 and we talked about some of the diseases

419
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,160
 that I was familiar with, he said,

420
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,160
 "Yes," he said, "the problem is we think we're so smart.

421
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,640
 "And so as our technology around food progresses,"

422
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,840
 he goes, "we actually have begun to poison ourselves."

423
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,440
 And he said this, 'cause he knew I was a believer

424
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,840
 of Christ at this time, he said,

425
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,560
 "We need to go back closer to the Garden of Eden."

426
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,320
 He said, "We're so far from Eden."

427
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,480
 I said, "What do you mean?"

428
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,160
 He said, "Well, think about it."

429
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,200
 He said, "What the movement that you're seeing,

430
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,800
 "this whole farm-to-table movement,

431
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,840
 "this whole organic movement, right,

432
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,760
 "is this whole gluten-free movement, if you will,

433
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,700
 "it's all going back to, hey,

434
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,340
 "eat stuff that's grown in the ground,

435
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,700
 "and cook it yourself.

436
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,280
 "Like, get away from processed food."

437
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,060
 He says, "We think we're moving forward.

438
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,520
 "We're actually moving back to where we started."

439
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,560
 And then he said this, and I wrote it down.

440
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,120
 He said, "As we've progressed in knowledge,

441
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,120
 "we've lost sight of truth."

442
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,080
 And I thought, what an incredible picture

443
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,600
 for where we're at.

444
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,740
 2016, we think we're getting so much smarter,

445
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,260
 but the statistics just don't say so.

446
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,040
 The numbers actually paint a grim picture.

447
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,920
 As we've progressed in knowledge,

448
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,280
 we've lost sight of truth.

449
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,180
 He said, "We're not healthy

450
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,240
 "because we are consuming unhealthy substances,

451
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,920
 "and isn't that true,

452
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,600
 "isn't that true for our spiritual journey?

453
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,900
 "We're not healthy because we're consuming ABC,

454
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,400
 "and CBS, and CNN, and not BIBLE."

455
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,460
 (congregation applauding)

456
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,480
 This is what's gonna make you healthy.

457
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,440
 Walk with God, a relationship,

458
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,080
 a pursuit of a relationship with a living deity,

459
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,340
 Jesus Christ.

460
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,040
 And so God determines what is true.

461
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,280
 How can we know what that is?

462
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,640
 Let's go back to the text, second part of verse seven.

463
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,920
 He says, "Rather than believing godless myths

464
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,840
 "and wives' tales,

465
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,440
 "I want you to train yourself to be godly."

466
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,680
 Train, circle that word.

467
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,180
 "Train yourself to be godly,

468
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,540
 "for physical training is of some value,

469
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,220
 "but godliness has value for all things,

470
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,580
 "holding promise for both the present life

471
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,800
 "and the life to come."

472
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,040
 What does that mean, holding promise

473
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
 for both the present life and the life to come?

474
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,360
 Here's what he's saying.

475
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,160
 He's saying, awesome, 24-hour fitness membership,

476
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,600
 way to go, it's not gonna matter in heaven.

477
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,800
 He's like, oh cool, man, CrossFit, yeah,

478
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,200
 join the box, do that thing, that's amazing, okay.

479
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,420
 But a billion years from now, that won't matter.

480
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,280
 You're not gonna walk up to St. Peter

481
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,760
 and be like, what's up, Pete?

482
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,040
 (congregation laughing)

483
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,880
 How you doing?

484
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,120
 (congregation laughing)

485
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,560
 You know, it's not gonna happen like that, okay?

486
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,240
 It won't, that won't matter.

487
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,200
 Be like, I worked out down there.

488
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,080
 He's like, so what?

489
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,560
 Did you study the Word?

490
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,600
 Because that matters up there.

491
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,360
 He's telling us that God, that training for godliness

492
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,140
 will matter a billion years from now.

493
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,880
 It will have some relevance in the kingdom of God.

494
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,080
 What we learn down here of eternal significance

495
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,920
 will matter up there.

496
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,160
 That's what this text is telling us.

497
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,440
 That is a trustworthy saying

498
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,480
 that deserves full acceptance, verse nine.

499
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,080
 "That is why we labor and strive,"

500
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,960
 circle labor and strive, "because we have put our hope

501
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,680
 "in the living God, who is Savior of all people,

502
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,480
 "and especially of those who believe,

503
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,360
 "command and teach these things."

504
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,480
 Now, look at these words.

505
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,440
 He's saying right here in this second part,

506
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,280
 he's saying, hey, this stuff really matters.

507
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,400
 Do you see what is of eternal significance?

508
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,920
 There's heaven, there's hell, there's people going to both,

509
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,280
 and you need to train yourself to be godly

510
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,320
 so that you can live a life of purpose

511
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,720
 and eternal significance and stop being duped

512
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,560
 by Dallas and Fort Worth and Houston

513
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,240
 and wherever you're at, you're being brainwashed.

514
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,260
 And you're partying off a cliff, man.

515
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,360
 And you think you're living a life that matters,

516
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,140
 and you're dead, and no one remembers you.

517
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,520
 And your life didn't matter.

518
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,000
 And no one came to Christ because of you.

519
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,680
 And no one became more godly because of you.

520
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,040
 And you didn't even become more godly because of you.

521
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,860
 And you get up there, you're like, CrossFit though.

522
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,620
 (congregation laughing)

523
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,620
 He's like, no, man.

524
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,860
 (congregation laughing)

525
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,100
 He's like, you missed it.

526
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,060
 My second point is train for godliness.

527
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,980
 Adulting is training for godliness.

528
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,420
 And so that word there for train is gymnazo.

529
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,500
 In the Greek, it's where we get the English word gymnasium

530
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,940
 and gymnastics, and what it means is to train

531
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,200
 or to exercise.

532
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,620
 It's a word that speaks of the rigorous

533
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,220
 and strenuous self-sacrificing training of athletes,

534
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,920
 pushing and persevering.

535
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,660
 Do you see what I'm saying?

536
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,460
 You gotta hear this, okay?

537
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,280
 Your salvation, like you getting to go to heaven,

538
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,420
 that's God's work.

539
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:26,260
 You getting to know God more, you play a part in that.

540
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,700
 The scripture is really, really, really clear.

541
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,320
 He's saying, strain, work hard at, discipline yourself.

542
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,760
 Now, it's his spirit working through you, okay?

543
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,620
 But there's a surrendering, there's a culpability,

544
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,280
 there's a responsibility on your part.

545
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,640
 And you can't be like, well, because it's difficult,

546
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,560
 it must not be right.

547
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,420
 No, he's saying it's difficult.

548
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,540
 He's saying it's hard.

549
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,760
 And the reason I'm telling you this is because some of us,

550
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,840
 listen, some of us work harder to look good

551
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,360
 than we do to look like God.

552
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,520
 Some of us work harder to look good

553
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,320
 than we do to look like God.

554
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,220
 We spend more time trying to look good,

555
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,000
 we spend more time thinking about looking good than we do.

556
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,900
 What does it mean to look like Jesus Christ

557
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,180
 and exemplify him?

558
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:26,280
 And friends, what I'm trying to tell you is,

559
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,340
 nobody's gonna wake up godly.

560
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,180
 Like, you don't just go to bed and be like,

561
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,640
 oh man, here it happened, look, here I am.

562
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,760
 I'm all godly and stuff, this is amazing.

563
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,160
 Like, what did I eat yesterday?

564
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,060
 No, it doesn't work that way.

565
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,440
 Like, the only way to become godly,

566
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,800
 now, I'm talking to believers now,

567
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,940
 if you're not a believer, if you're not a Christian,

568
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,040
 if you haven't trusted in Christ's death and resurrection

569
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,060
 for the forgiveness of your sins,

570
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,560
 if you don't know you're gonna be in heaven,

571
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,400
 I'm not talking about you right now,

572
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,920
 I'm really glad you're here,

573
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,520
 but I'm talking to my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ.

574
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,760
 You have to discipline yourself

575
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,880
 and work hard at knowing God's word.

576
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,040
 And here's why, because there's no cruise control

577
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,000
 in Christianity.

578
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,720
 Do you hear me?

579
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,120
 Like, the only way to move forward in Christianity

580
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,920
 is to feed the engine gas.

581
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,700
 If you let off the accelerator,

582
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,120
 you are decreasing in speed.

583
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,680
 You are declining in faith.

584
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,240
 You are slowing down.

585
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,560
 There's no cruise control in Christianity.

586
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,320
 In Christians, in the history of the world,

587
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,480
 there's never been someone that's like,

588
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,420
 man, I made it.

589
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,840
 I'm gonna stop reading the Bible,

590
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,680
 I'm gonna stop praying,

591
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,020
 I'm gonna stop living in community,

592
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,140
 I'm gonna stop being fed truth,

593
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,640
 but I'm gonna stay right where I'm at, me and God.

594
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,040
 It's never happened in the history of the world.

595
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:47,040
 And so the only way to progress in godliness for believers

596
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,960
 is to train yourself, to discipline yourself,

597
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,660
 to grow in this idea.

598
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,040
 And so for me, man, let me just be honest,

599
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,800
 I don't like to read.

600
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,680
 Like, some of you, man, you love to read.

601
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,240
 Praise God for you, we need you to teach our children.

602
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,120
 And then there's me, and I'm like dumb pastor guy.

603
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,720
 I'm like, I don't really like to read.

604
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
 Can I listen to something?

605
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,000
 Is there podcasters?

606
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,320
 Can somebody read it to me?

607
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,160
 And so if you're here and you don't like to read,

608
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,480
 I get it, but let me tell you something.

609
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,160
 I can't use that as an excuse.

610
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,920
 Every single day I read.

611
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,440
 That is a part of my daily discipline

612
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,440
 because it is one of the ways that God talks to us.

613
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,800
 And I don't have to like it,

614
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,280
 but I see fruit in my life because of it.

615
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,040
 I see ways that I benefit because of it,

616
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,560
 and the way that I treat my wife,

617
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,840
 and the way that I disciple my children because of it.

618
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,720
 And so I have to work hard at it.

619
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,620
 I was in Haiti with one of our elders,

620
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,560
 and as I introduced him,

621
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,240
 I was really thoughtful in my introduction.

622
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,480
 I wasn't just flippantly throwing out compliments,

623
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,080
 but I said this, and I want you to know what I said.

624
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,080
 I said, "I want you to meet the wisest man I've ever met."

625
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,720
 That's a big compliment, and I meant it.

626
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,240
 I thought about it before I said

627
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,360
 he's the wisest man I ever met.

628
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,480
 And I realized I had two plane flights there with him,

629
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,520
 and two plane flights back with him.

630
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,760
 And I'm like, he's got all this wisdom.

631
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,760
 I'm gonna figure out what makes him so wise.

632
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,960
 And as I was thinking about that,

633
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,800
 I was realized that before he would answer any question,

634
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,040
 he would never, ever, he never gives his opinion.

635
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,160
 He never says, "Well, I think," or, "Man, this one time,"

636
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,560
 or, "I've been in that situation before."

637
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,520
 He always says what God's Word says,

638
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,240
 what the Scripture says,

639
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,040
 what these ancient truths written by the Creator

640
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,680
 of the heavens and the earth say.

641
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,900
 He's disciplined himself before he just responds

642
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,480
 with his knee-jerk and his opinion

643
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,280
 to think about what Scriptures does he know

644
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,700
 that are applicable to the situation.

645
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,160
 Now, to do that, you gotta know a lot of Scriptures.

646
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,840
 And so I'm just like, well, of course,

647
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,680
 he probably likes to read,

648
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,520
 he probably memorized the Bible.

649
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,720
 That's what smart people do.

650
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,920
 And then when we're talking, he's like,

651
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,260
 "No, I don't like to read."

652
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,440
 I'm like, "Well, you just removed all my excuses."

653
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,960
 (congregation laughing)

654
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,320
 He's like, "No, I've had to discipline myself

655
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,240
 "to learn the Scriptures."

656
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,200
 And it was so good for me to hear that.

657
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,340
 In verse 10 here, he says,

658
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,500
 "We labor because we have hope."

659
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,240
 The reason we do this is because we have hope

660
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,400
 of a future glory,

661
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,680
 of an eternal kingdom.

662
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,080
 And there's people that don't know it.

663
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
 So in everything we can, we train ourselves

664
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,440
 so that they might know it.

665
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,480
 It's no secret, if you've been with us at all,

666
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,320
 I hate, with all my heart,

667
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,760
 physical exercise of any kind.

668
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,000
 (congregation laughing)

669
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,720
 I really don't like to get my heart rate up.

670
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,900
 I like to keep it at a nice resting pace.

671
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,820
 And so when your metabolism begins to slow down,

672
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,120
 you start to feel that a little bit.

673
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,320
 And so I went through this program called Well.

674
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,420
 It's a 12-week crossfit program

675
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,780
 with some spiritual implications as well.

676
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,780
 And I went through it.

677
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,440
 I hated just about every second of it.

678
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,040
 And lots of strenuous exercise in this.

679
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,920
 But I saw the clear fruit.

680
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,540
 I'd go places, people would be like,

681
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,880
 "Man, you lost weight."

682
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,680
 And I didn't, I actually gained weight,

683
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,400
 but just reshaped some weight.

684
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,800
 And people were like, "Man, you look good."

685
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,200
 And I'm like, "Thank you, really, you think so?"

686
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,540
 (congregation laughing)

687
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,400
 And what happened is this ended right about Thanksgiving.

688
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,620
 And so Thanksgiving came and went,

689
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,160
 and then you got Christmas.

690
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,440
 That's a lot of fun.

691
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,820
 And I didn't work out a lot in that time.

692
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,800
 And so just this week, I'm talking to Monica,

693
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,120
 and I'm just sad.

694
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,560
 And she's like, "Why are you so sad?"

695
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,760
 And I said, "Well, because I feel like I'm back

696
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,640
 "where I started before well."

697
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,600
 And it's just the realization

698
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,360
 that the body requires maintenance.

699
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,560
 You can't get to a place and just stay there.

700
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,480
 No one's ever worked out, got into bodybuilding shape,

701
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,640
 and then stopped working out and just stayed there.

702
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,660
 As soon as you stop, you start to go the other direction.

703
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,000
 As soon as you change your diet,

704
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,500
 as soon as you stop disciplining yourself,

705
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,160
 the spiritual life is the exact same way.

706
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,520
 It's the best metaphor I can think of.

707
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,560
 As soon as you stop training yourself to be godly,

708
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,220
 you are becoming ungodly.

709
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,200
 I'm not saying unsaved.

710
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,800
 I'm saying less like God, more selfish,

711
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,380
 less loving, less peaceful, more anxious.

712
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,020
 These are creeping in your life.

713
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,060
 Verse 12, we'll end with this verse.

714
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,320
 He says, "Don't let," Paul says to Timothy.

715
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,960
 He says, "Don't let anyone look down on you

716
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,320
 "because you are young."

717
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,720
 Man, I love, do y'all love that verse?

718
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,740
 Get off me, man.

719
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,100
 Can't look down on me because I'm young, man.

720
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,220
 Come on, don't let anyone look down on you

721
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,400
 because you're young.

722
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,920
 Yeah.

723
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,220
 Like the whole world needs to know.

724
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,180
 Don't let, don't look down on me because I'm,

725
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,820
 I'll be CEO of this joint.

726
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,660
 Don't look down on me because I'm young.

727
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,620
 I can do anything.

728
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,580
 Through Christ who's, get off me.

729
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,480
 That's what it does in me.

730
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,380
 I don't know if it does that in you,

731
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,140
 but that's how I feel.

732
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,420
 Don't look down on me because I'm young.

733
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,200
 Oh, there's a second part though.

734
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,180
 Oh, it's like he's saying,

735
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,100
 and here's how you do that, Timothy.

736
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,700
 Isn't that awesome if Timothy responded like,

737
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,740
 yeah, get off me.

738
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,780
 Anyways, he says, hey, here's how you do that, Timothy.

739
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,860
 Tim, come here.

740
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,260
 Don't let 'em look down on you because you're young.

741
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,380
 Here's what I want you to do so that that doesn't happen.

742
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,300
 I want you to set an example for believers in speech

743
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,580
 and in conduct and in the way you love

744
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,260
 and in faith and in purity.

745
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:01,100
 Hey, Timothy, here's how you don't let 'em look down on you

746
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,140
 because you're young.

747
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,940
 You be an adult.

748
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,500
 You be a woman.

749
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,700
 Timothy, no, you be a man.

750
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,580
 Here's how you do that.

751
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,260
 There's this, I don't know if you read the blog.

752
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,180
 We've had a lot of fun with this series, adulting,

753
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,900
 and so people have sent memes and all kinds of stuff,

754
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,780
 and one of 'em just said, it's that moment

755
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,300
 when you're looking for an adult

756
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
 and you look around everywhere

757
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,060
 only to find that you are one,

758
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,920
 and so then you begin to look for an adultier adult.

759
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,940
 And so we just took that and made the third point

760
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,520
 be the adultier adult.

761
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,500
 Like adulting is not about age.

762
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,460
 I know the government says it's 18 or whatever it says.

763
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,220
 Adult, being an adult is not about an age.

764
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,260
 So it begs the question, like what is it?

765
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,060
 And so I think for so many of us,

766
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,780
 it's that we want the freedom to be an adult

767
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,600
 our entire lives only to get to a place

768
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,700
 where really to find out being an adult

769
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,160
 is more about surrender than anything else.

770
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
 It's about being submissive

771
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
 to God, the creator of the universe.

772
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,600
 And so be the adultier adult by setting an example.

773
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,400
 He just says to Timothy, hey, you can't ask them

774
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,360
 to do anything that you're not willing to do.

775
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,200
 That's relevant to me.

776
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,360
 I can't say, hey, you guys need to pursue purity

777
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,480
 unless I'm pursuing purity.

778
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,560
 I can't say, you need to stop looking at porn, right,

779
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,760
 if I'm looking at porn every single day, right?

780
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,800
 And so you wouldn't listen to me.

781
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,820
 You guys need to be good stewards.

782
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,600
 If I'm spending money on whatever I want,

783
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,320
 that wouldn't be right, and so he just says that.

784
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,520
 Hey, you set an example, and I want you to set an example

785
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,680
 specifically in the way you talk.

786
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,840
 Number one, speech.

787
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,400
 He's just gonna give us four or five things here,

788
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,600
 five things here to set an example in.

789
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,500
 So first, speech.

790
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:54,880
 You know, that's gossip.

791
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,060
 That's exaggerations that are really lies.

792
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,840
 It's cussing.

793
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,120
 It's the way you talk.

794
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,360
 It's the way you're representing your God.

795
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,720
 Jesus really cares about this.

796
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,360
 He says it's not what goes into a man that defiles him,

797
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,520
 but it's what comes out, and I love that he says

798
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,840
 it's what comes out that defiles him,

799
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,260
 not what comes out that makes him defiled,

800
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,600
 or not what comes out that is evidence

801
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,800
 that something is corrupt.

802
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,300
 He says whatever comes out defiles him.

803
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:26,120
 That's different, and when I trusted Christ,

804
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,840
 like I may have cussed like a sailor, right,

805
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,600
 and lied for fun, and was just a terrible person,

806
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
 especially in regards to what came out.

807
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,760
 There was clearly something corrupt within,

808
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,920
 and when I trusted Christ,

809
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,600
 this was one of the first things he changed,

810
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,720
 one of the first things my friends noticed.

811
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,640
 It's like, man, I mean, like I would use F-bomb

812
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,960
 as a noun, verb, adjective, like anything,

813
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,440
 and they were just like, man,

814
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,880
 the way you talk changed.

815
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,760
 That's the Spirit of God.

816
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,920
 That's what he does.

817
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,540
 Set an example in the way you talk.

818
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,980
 Children say silly things.

819
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,240
 Be an adult to your adult in speech.

820
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,840
 Secondly, he says conduct.

821
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,220
 He says act right.

822
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,740
 We say a lot of times here,

823
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,980
 we're not about behavior modification.

824
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,260
 We don't wanna just change your behavior.

825
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,120
 We wanna change your belief.

826
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,720
 He's saying, hey, Timothy, if your belief has changed,

827
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,960
 if you know the one true God,

828
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,160
 then you've gotta represent that you know him

829
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,760
 through the way that you act,

830
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,000
 the way that you conduct yourself.

831
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,520
 And so some of us are here,

832
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,080
 and we've lived a life where we loved to cross the lines.

833
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,040
 The other day, I'm at my,

834
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,320
 I say the other day, it was a while ago.

835
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,520
 I'm at my kid's school, and there's this sign.

836
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,760
 And so there's a bunch of seven-year-olds running around,

837
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,120
 and there's this sign that says do not touch.

838
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,560
 And then there's this girl that goes up,

839
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,200
 and she kinda looks around, and she goes.

840
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,880
 [congregation laughing]

841
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,080
 And then she just begins to start like, ha ha ha.

842
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
 And then she starts to wave over.

843
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,400
 Look at me, look at what I'm doing.

844
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,300
 And I watched the whole thing go down.

845
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,180
 And I got really sad.

846
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,140
 Because I know that girl when she's 25.

847
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,220
 She's been in my office before.

848
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,440
 She continues to find identity in relationships with guys.

849
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,860
 She continues to push boundaries for fun.

850
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,800
 She calls it free thinking and creative and artistic,

851
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,100
 and really, it's just sin.

852
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,200
 She says, yeah, I don't like the rules.

853
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,780
 I don't like to be confined by being places on time

854
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,620
 and things like that.

855
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,900
 But in reality, she's just a poor representative

856
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,920
 of Jesus Christ.

857
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,440
 And so some of you have found identity

858
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,600
 in your ability and desire to break the rules.

859
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,200
 And what you need to hear from this text

860
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,020
 is it's not God honoring.

861
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,580
 It's not cute anymore.

862
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,000
 It's what children do.

863
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,760
 Be an adultier adult.

864
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:49,200
 It says love, the way that you love.

865
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,120
 It's not an emotion, but an action.

866
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,060
 I've got kids, like kids only think about themselves.

867
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,560
 My three-year-old Weston, man.

868
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
 He wakes up every morning.

869
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,540
 Dad, I want breakfast.

870
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,060
 Like he's never in the history of me knowing him

871
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,660
 for three years, woken up and be like,

872
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,960
 Daddy, I wanna share my toys with everyone.

873
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,240
 Daddy, what can I do today to just serve the world

874
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,340
 and make it a better place?

875
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,600
 He's just never done these things.

876
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,040
 He's like, he wakes up and he's like, that's my toy.

877
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,480
 Give me this, I want this.

878
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,220
 Like children are naturally narcissistic.

879
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,300
 They just want things.

880
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,560
 They don't think about, hey, how can I love everyone else?

881
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,160
 They think, how can everyone, the whole world love me?

882
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,960
 And some of us, when we think about love,

883
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,620
 that's what we think, how can I be loved?

884
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,080
 How can I make others love me?

885
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,600
 How can I experience the erotic and manic highs

886
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,880
 of how the world defines love,

887
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,760
 not how can I give it selflessly?

888
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,320
 How can I care for others?

889
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,660
 How can I make the world a better place?

890
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,320
 He says, set an example in faith.

891
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,260
 In the way that you trust God.

892
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,620
 He says, I want you to model for others

893
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,860
 what it looks like to trust God.

894
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,640
 Now, this is a really difficult one

895
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,380
 because your greatest opportunities

896
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,600
 to trust God are catastrophes.

897
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,920
 It's the chaos of life.

898
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,140
 These are your opportunities to trust God.

899
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,980
 And I remember, I remember walking into a church hungover.

900
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,180
 I remember sitting there, getting there early,

901
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,420
 just in search of hope.

902
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,580
 I remember living the Dallas life.

903
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,360
 I had the Jaguar in the penthouse condo

904
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,580
 and I had the job that I didn't really like

905
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,340
 and I just thought I'll do this the rest of my life.

906
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,460
 Like I'll just settle and I'll buy lots of things

907
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,740
 and I'll try to fill the void.

908
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,260
 And I went to church and I sat there

909
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,500
 and I was reading Matthew chapter six

910
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,100
 and it's the red letters of my Bible.

911
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,380
 It's the words of Jesus.

912
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,780
 And it's just like the Lord spoke to me.

913
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,260
 And I heard in a way that's not normative for me,

914
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,980
 the near audible voice of God.

915
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,420
 He says, hey bro, I got you.

916
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,980
 I said, I got you.

917
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,980
 It's like he asked me this question.

918
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,980
 Do you trust me?

919
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,800
 Do you trust me?

920
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,140
 Would you stop trying to drive this thing?

921
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,620
 Do you know what I've done for you in Jesus Christ?

922
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,020
 Do you know all that crazy stuff?

923
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,340
 You know how you abused my daughters?

924
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,740
 You know how you've been reckless with the things

925
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,320
 that I've entrusted to you?

926
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,140
 Son, I got you.

927
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,340
 Son, surrender to me.

928
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,860
 He says, I want you to set an example in purity.

929
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,740
 In purity.

930
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:35,140
 My kids love to play house, man.

931
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,280
 Get home from school, dress up.

932
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,780
 I'll be the mommy, you be the daddy,

933
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,900
 you be the baby, you be the poodle.

934
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,380
 And they love to play house.

935
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,600
 They've got props for playing house.

936
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,140
 They've got dishes, they've got a kitchen.

937
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,860
 I mean, they love to play house.

938
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,180
 And like so many of us, right, our entire lives,

939
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,500
 like we've just been playing adults.

940
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,860
 I remember pushing the fake lawnmower,

941
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,820
 you know, mowing the grass.

942
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,140
 Like all of our toys are really just adult props

943
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,100
 if you think about it.

944
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
 Growing up, like we've just been playing adult

945
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,540
 our whole life, and then all of a sudden

946
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,820
 you get to the other side of college

947
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,020
 and you're still playing adult.

948
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,900
 And for some of us, we're still playing house.

949
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,820
 And we just don't like, we know, like we think,

950
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,740
 we sense that maybe it's not God's best,

951
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,460
 but we've been traveling down this path

952
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,540
 and it feels too far to turn around.

953
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,920
 And we've just been feeding our desires like children do.

954
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,580
 And we're playing house.

955
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,980
 Then I just wanna beg you, stop playing house.

956
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,820
 Get married.

957
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,060
 Like I talked to somebody, I'm like,

958
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,580
 hey, you know, yeah, no, we've been engaged for four years.

959
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,740
 I'm like, what?

960
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,740
 What do you hope to find out?

961
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,140
 (congregation laughing)

962
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,300
 Like what do you not, son, come here.

963
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,860
 What do you not know about her that you hope to find out

964
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,780
 in the next six years or six months?

965
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,940
 What do you not know right now?

966
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,260
 Put a ring on it.

967
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,220
 Oh, you already did.

968
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,780
 Put a different ring on it.

969
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,860
 (congregation laughing)

970
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,700
 Okay?

971
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:04,440
 Like that's not a biblical worldview.

972
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,580
 Four year engagements and not,

973
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,940
 that's the symptom of a false truth.

974
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,180
 Go back to point one.

975
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,700
 Engagement sucks.

976
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,660
 It's like marriage without sex, right?

977
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,020
 I mean, it's not fun, right?

978
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,220
 And so for some of you, it's like,

979
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,500
 no, it's marriage with sex.

980
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,800
 Well, that's not gonna go well for you either.

981
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,300
 Okay, you're missing something.

982
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,380
 God says, I want you to set an example in purity,

983
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,440
 personal purity.

984
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,620
 When it's just you and your computer, you and your iPhone,

985
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,980
 how long are you gonna have that struggle, man?

986
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,480
 Since the fifth grade, like look up, you're 23.

987
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,060
 Until I get married, no, it only grows in marriage.

988
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,020
 Like when are you gonna say, no, enough already.

989
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,100
 Spirit of God, creator of the heavens and the earth,

990
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,620
 you are big enough to cast out the demons

991
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,900
 of the Gerasian demoniac.

992
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,400
 You are big enough to help me in this struggle.

993
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,880
 I'm gonna bring it in the light.

994
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,720
 I'm gonna confess it.

995
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,860
 I'm gonna have others pray for me.

996
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,820
 I'm gonna live in community.

997
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,180
 I'm gonna walk in purity.

998
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,780
 I'm tired of playing house.

999
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,500
 You got two options when it comes to purity,

1000
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,300
 purity and marriage, no other options.

1001
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,580
 Purity and marriage, period.

1002
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,120
 Choose one.

1003
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,580
 And if it's been chosen for you, then walk in it.

1004
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,040
 Walk in it well as an example.

1005
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,980
 In summary, grow up on truth.

1006
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,620
 Train to be godly.

1007
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,620
 And be an adult to your adult,

1008
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,020
 which just means to set an example

1009
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,820
 in your adulting, biblically, godly.

1010
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,120
 It's that mission of hope.

1011
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,360
 This is our partner in Haiti.

1012
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,500
 It's a compound, if you will.

1013
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,720
 And I'm driving through it and he's showing me the church.

1014
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,620
 And this is all in this compound in Haiti.

1015
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,220
 And there's this church and there's this school.

1016
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,820
 And there's this food distribution

1017
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,400
 where they give out 91,000 meals a day.

1018
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,060
 I mean, incredible partner, Mission of Hope.

1019
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,120
 And so we're driving around and they show me the orphanage.

1020
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,620
 And so this is where the kids come up.

1021
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,900
 I've been there four or five times,

1022
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,820
 so I've seen all of this.

1023
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,980
 And so we're driving through the property

1024
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,020
 'cause my buddy had never been.

1025
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,620
 And we're getting this tour in Haiti at Mission of Hope.

1026
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,620
 And we're seeing these different establishments.

1027
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,500
 And he pulls up to this building that I had never seen.

1028
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,020
 It's there at the bottom of kind of the hill.

1029
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,620
 And it's this new building.

1030
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,860
 And I was like, what's that?

1031
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,540
 And he's like, well, this is what I'm really excited about.

1032
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,140
 This is our transition house.

1033
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,660
 I was like, well, what's a transition house?

1034
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,540
 And he goes, well, we've been around for a while.

1035
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,700
 And so we've had orphans that have come up

1036
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,020
 and they've turned 18, 19, 20.

1037
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,100
 And so we have to send them into the real world.

1038
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,060
 Well, we learned that they go into the real world

1039
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,960
 and they just can't handle it.

1040
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,440
 They don't know what to do.

1041
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,640
 And so we had to build this transition house

1042
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,140
 so that once they graduate from the orphanage,

1043
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,620
 they can go and they can live there.

1044
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,240
 And we can begin to teach them life skills

1045
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,840
 so that they can adapt to the real world.

1046
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,020
 Like, that's awesome.

1047
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,140
 Where was my transition house?

1048
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,220
 I needed a transition house.

1049
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,820
 Like, I needed someone to come around me.

1050
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,880
 And as I thought about that, like, and I even said that.

1051
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,660
 And I wanna share with you something he said,

1052
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,540
 I love this.

1053
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,660
 And he's explaining it to me.

1054
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,540
 He says, it's like our intern, Katie said,

1055
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,100
 he's telling me what this transition house is.

1056
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,220
 He says, it's like we're teaching them

1057
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,220
 to ride a bike in a field

1058
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,580
 instead of a concrete path.

1059
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,260
 And that's what I did this over the break.

1060
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,940
 Like I took the girls to my parents' house.

1061
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,520
 There's a field there.

1062
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,440
 I put 'em on the bike and I walked them through it

1063
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,360
 so that when they fell off, you know,

1064
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,340
 I was there and I picked 'em up and I said, listen.

1065
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,180
 And I just showed 'em how they were gonna do that.

1066
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,620
 And as I thought about that,

1067
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,680
 I was like, we're a transition house.

1068
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,440
 The porch is a transition house.

1069
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,600
 Like, that's a part of what we wanna be about here.

1070
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,480
 If you're not in a place right now

1071
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,100
 where you feel beat up by the world,

1072
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,760
 you're going to very, very soon.

1073
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,260
 Okay, you're gonna get there.

1074
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,140
 And I want you to return to the body of Christ.

1075
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:15,640
 Not so that we can teach you tips and tricks on growing up,

1076
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,340
 but so that we can remind you of the one

1077
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,380
 who came to earth to die for your sins.

1078
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,660
 He lived a perfect life.

1079
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,760
 He rose from the grave and he gives you a hope,

1080
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,340
 the hope that we strive and strain for,

1081
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,220
 the hope that we discipline ourselves for godliness for,

1082
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,580
 the hope that we're gonna be with God forever

1083
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,980
 and ever and ever and ever.

1084
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,840
 And so let me just tell you something, man.

1085
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,320
 13 years ago, I stumbled into this church.

1086
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,140
 I was at a bar and someone invited me.

1087
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,920
 And I went in and I came in,

1088
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,200
 I was wearing the clothes from the night before,

1089
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,080
 I smelled like smoke, and I sat in the back

1090
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,340
 and I was hungover, had this massive headache.

1091
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,760
 And what my life looked like was

1092
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,800
 I just wanted to be a millionaire before I was 30.

1093
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,420
 I loved the party scene.

1094
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,000
 Like, all I knew in college was partying,

1095
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,420
 and so when I came out of college, I thought,

1096
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,200
 more partying, this is just what we do.

1097
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,240
 And my life was stuck in this really boring cycle

1098
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,280
 that I called fun.

1099
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,640
 And it looked like going to the bar,

1100
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,500
 taking shots of Patron, drinking some Miller Lite,

1101
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,760
 going home, throwing up, going back to the bar,

1102
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,400
 shots of Patron, drinking Miller Lite,

1103
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,060
 snorting a line maybe if that was there, that sounded fun,

1104
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,360
 sleeping with a stranger, that's a lot of fun.

1105
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,760
 And I was just stuck in that rut

1106
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,760
 over and over and over and over.

1107
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,520
 Someone came in my life

1108
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,320
 and I believed upon the gospel

1109
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,640
 that Christ had died for all the junk that I had done,

1110
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,760
 and God raised him from the dead.

1111
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,820
 And they began to help discipline me for godliness.

1112
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,740
 They began to show me a way.

1113
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,420
 They began to let me kind of experiment in this field

1114
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,360
 called the body of Christ, where I would fall off

1115
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,440
 and they'd come around me and help me get back on,

1116
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,000
 and it was this beautiful picture.

1117
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,800
 And I know as I share that right now,

1118
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,300
 that thousands of you, thousands of you don't have that.

1119
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,260
 I know you don't, 'cause I talk to you, I get your emails,

1120
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,700
 we converse in the hallways,

1121
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,620
 and I know so many of you don't have that.

1122
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:16,140
 And so you cannot become an adult in the body of Christ

1123
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,980
 or in the kingdom without that.

1124
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,740
 You are in the right place.

1125
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,100
 It's no accident that you're here tonight

1126
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,100
 as we start this series.

1127
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,940
 I'm so glad you're here.

1128
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,780
 Let's run together.

1129
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,780
 Let's do life together.

1130
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:35,400
 Let us help you find that beautiful picture of the kingdom.

1131
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
 Let me pray for us.

1132
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:50,080
 Father, I love you and thank you for just an opportunity

1133
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,940
 to start a new year here at the porch

1134
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,020
 and just all that you've done through this place.

1135
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,300
 I thank you for people listening in Houston

1136
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,660
 and Fort Worth and all over the world.

1137
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,740
 And thank you for the overflow tonight

1138
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,000
 and traffic jams, God.

1139
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,580
 Just that we would gather around your word.

1140
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,980
 Would you continue to teach us as we leave this place?

1141
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,580
 Would you continue to instruct our hearts?

1142
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,820
 Would you help us to set an example in speech

1143
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:23,420
 and in conduct and in faith and in love and in purity?

1144
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,380
 And God, for my friends that are here tonight

1145
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,880
 and they're wrestling and they just feel

1146
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,020
 like they've been yelled at for an hour,

1147
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,940
 would you convict their hearts as we sing this song

1148
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,860
 to make them new?

1149
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,980
 Would you show them the promise of eternal life

1150
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,380
 through your son, Jesus Christ,

1151
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,980
 and all that you've done for them,

1152
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,620
 the hope that you give them in Jesus Christ?

1153
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:49,060
 The freedom, the liberty that we have in Jesus Christ.

1154
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,660
 For so many of us, God, that's what we want

1155
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,460
 is we wanna be free and we don't realize

1156
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,560
 that freedom comes from you and you alone.

1157
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,560
 It's in the name of your son, Jesus, I pray, amen.

1158
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,940
 The other day, my little girl Finley goes,

1159
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,160
 Daddy, I can't wait 'til I'm a grown up.

1160
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,880
 And I said, baby girl, why?

1161
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,640
 I said, why, why can't you wait 'til you're,

1162
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,780
 she goes, 'cause then I'm free to do whatever I want.

1163
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,700
 And I even asked her, what would you do, sweetie?

1164
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,720
 What would you do if you had the freedom to do whatever you want?

1165
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,120
 She goes, I don't know, I just wouldn't have to like

1166
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,800
 go to bed on time and stuff.

1167
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,720
 That's true if you wanna be really tired at work.

1168
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,160
 I think though, as I think about my own life

1169
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,720
 and I reflect on just the pain that I feel for you

1170
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,840
 in the room, it's like, that's what I actually thought.

1171
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,700
 Like until very recently, like not very long ago,

1172
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,560
 I just thought, man, I just wanna be free

1173
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,000
 to do whatever I want.

1174
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,440
 And like, being free to do whatever I want

1175
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,600
 really meant freedom from integrity.

1176
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,600
 It meant having the freedom to hurt people

1177
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,680
 in ways I wasn't even aware of.

1178
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,340
 And it meant having the freedom to run from God

1179
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,880
 as fast and as hard as I could.

1180
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,160
 But God who is rich in mercy reached down and grabbed my life

1181
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,400
 and I'm not crazy to think that that's what he's doing

1182
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,240
 to you right now.

1183
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,480
 He's reaching down and grabbing your life and saying,

1184
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,560
 hey, freedom comes through full submission to me.

1185
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,640
 Freedom only comes, liberty only comes

1186
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,700
 through complete and total surrender to my will

1187
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,680
 because I created the world and everything in it

1188
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,360
 and I have a plan for your life.

1189
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,260
 I'm so excited to be with you guys through this series, man.

1190
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,120
 We will hang out for the next six weeks

1191
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,600
 in this series adulting and just continue

1192
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,860
 through the scriptures to learn.

1193
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,040
 And so thank you guys for being with us tonight.

1194
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,360
 We have a porch late night out there.

1195
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,640
 So hang around, there's gonna be a party outside

1196
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,640
 and the voter registrations,

1197
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,560
 voters registration guys are also here.

1198
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,480
 So they have a booth set up.

1199
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,400
 A part of adulting is voting.

1200
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,160
 And so go and do your civic duty,

1201
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,920
 register if you haven't done that.

1202
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,820
 And so I love you guys.

1203
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,420
 Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
