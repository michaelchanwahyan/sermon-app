00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 We're just trying to drive hoodie sales is what we're trying to do.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hand and force modesty. I'm kidding. But I kid because I care.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 So tonight we're starting a series called Colossians where we're going to be studying the book of Colossians for the next few weeks.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm going to start us off with kind of a story that will tell us where we're going.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 My first year on staff here, I was like totally broke.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 What I mean by broke is I had no money.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I was part time here and I was full time in grad school.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I was trying to make ends meet, giving plasma and doing odd jobs on the side.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Attending extra watermark events based on whether or not they had food.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Is this a women's ministry thing? Is there food there?

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I owned one thing. There was one thing that I owned.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 It was a 2003 Xterra. I know, don't be jealous.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Which for some reason is like a ladies car. Only sorority girls drive this thing.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Any guys that drive it? You're not going to raise your hand now.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I drove this and I loved the Xterra. I was a big fan. It's a great SUV.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I kept it in immaculate shape. I would wash it all the time. I did all the maintenance on it.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I kept it in great shape because it was the one thing that I owned.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 It was my little lady car and I loved it.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 There was a day where I was going to meet someone for lunch.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I am driving and I hear this... I'm not a car guy.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I knew that was not a good sound. I pull over and it starts steaming.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I open up the hood. Whatever it's called.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I open that up. I'm just totally lost in a train of thought.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I open up the hood and I know what I'm looking for.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I have no idea what things are supposed to look like in there.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I just go and try to start it again. It won't start. I have it towed to a mechanic that I knew.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Who I trusted. They ran all these tests and they came back.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 They said, "Your car is totaled. I've got some bad news. It's totally worthless. It's totaled."

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I was like, "What? Is this a joke right now? What do you mean it's totaled?

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Look how clean it is. This thing is awesome. What do you mean it's totaled?"

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 He said, "Yeah, some coolant got into the oil pan and the oil pan gives the oil to the engine.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 It's kind of what keeps the engine running."

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 He said, "Anything that gets into the oil pan other than oil will totally ruin the engine."

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I'm like, "Wait, what do you mean totaled?"

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 He's like, "Well, we'll give you $500 for it."

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I'm like, "Am I being punked? Is Ashton here somewhere? Is this a joke?

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I will Flintstone this thing home before I'm going to take $500 for my...

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I'm insulted right now."

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 He said, "Look, it's totaled. You need a new engine, which is worth more than it's worth.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Anything that gets in the oil pan except for oil will totally destroy an engine."

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 The reason I tell you that story is because much like anything getting into an oil pan and an engine will ruin a car,

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 if anything is added to the message of grace for Christians,

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 the message of grace, and what I mean by that is God's undeserved kindness towards you.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 If anything is added to make you have to deserve it, it becomes anything but grace.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Anything added to grace becomes anything but grace.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Anything added, whether it's...

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Hey, if you're a Christian, yes, you get God's grace, but you also have to do some good things.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Yes, you also can't drink, can't dance, can't see rated R movies.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 You have to have a baptism or a second baptism or speak in tongues.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Then you're really a Christian.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Anything added to it, to grace, becomes anything but grace.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 It ruins totally the engine on which Christianity runs, on which the Christian life is lived.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Interestingly enough, there was an entire letter that the apostle Paul wrote to a group of believers who were struggling with this idea.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 They were being told different messages, and this was when the New Testament was new.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 There wasn't a Bible.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 There were just kind of apostles who go around teaching.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 They're being told these competing different ideas, and being told really that Jesus gets it started, and then you need to do some certain things.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Paul writes this letter to this group of believers in Colossae to say, "No, if you add anything to grace, it becomes anything but grace."

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 For the next few weeks, we're going to study this letter.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 We're going to be in the book of Colossians.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open there.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 If you don't, it'll be on the screen.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 If you don't have a Bible, we have some in the Welcome Center that would be our gift to you.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Let me set up a little bit of what's going on in Colossae.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Colossae is kind of an interesting city because it was a major trade center, and so all these different roads would run through it.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Because of that, there was all kinds of different people, backgrounds, beliefs that all came to live in this city of Colossae.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 People of different religions, people of different skin tones, people of every different walk of life all came to live here.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 It was a really interesting city.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 It was like Austin, like the same "Keep Austin Weird" is "Keep Colossae Weird."

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 That's what's going on.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 There's all these different ideas that fill the people, or all these different beliefs that fill the people who make up this city.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 These Christians, these new Christians, are being told by all kinds of other people, "Yes, Jesus, but you also need to believe," or "You also need to do this."

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 What else is interesting about Colossae is Colossae was known primarily for two different things.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 The first one was this area was the hub of Mother Nature worshipers.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Her name was Saebo, but essentially she's Mother Nature.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 They did all kinds of weird—we won't even really go into it—but all kinds of Mother Nature worship in this area.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 The reason people were so driven or so likely to worship Mother Nature is because there's one other thing that happened all the time in Colossae.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Earthquakes.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Earthquakes happened all the time.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 People, during an age when there wasn't any scientific—people just didn't know really how anything happened.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 So they'd go, "Earthquakes? Oh my gosh, it's Mother Nature. Again, we need to please her. Christians are not doing their job."

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 So there were all these different competing ideas about how the world worked, and all of these people persecuting Christians inside of the church, saying, "Yes, Jesus, and you also need to do some other things."

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 So Paul writes to this group of believers, and he's sitting in a prison cell.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 He's sitting there in Rome, and he begins to write out how they have everything that they need in Christ.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And he gives them the secret to how people change.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Really, it's a topic we talk about all the time here, about what changes people.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And ironically, it's not hearing another message. It's not trying a little harder.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And he lays out what the secret is to experiencing change.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 So we're going to pick it up in verse 1 of chapter 1, and we'll get started.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 So let me say just this one last thing before we start in chapter 1, because this letter is unique among Paul's letters, too.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 It's been called by many scholars the most profound of all of Paul's letters, or most difficult to understand.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Paul writes a little bit like my sister talks, and what I mean by that, and I love my sister, but she's like a verbal processor who will jump from one topic to the next.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Anyone? No one's ever met anyone like this before? Maybe it's a woman thing.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And she'll just jump from one topic -- I'm kidding.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 She'll jump from one topic to the next, where she's like, "Oh, and the sky, the weather was great today, and I can't believe that she wore that thing.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And oh my gosh, the Mavs won, and I can't believe --" and I'm like, "What is going on?"

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Paul, in this letter, will do something very similar, where he'll go from one topic to the next.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So we're going to follow him and kind of move slow to make sure we don't miss anything.

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 But if you walk away confused, one, it's my fault if the student hasn't learned, teacher hasn't taught.

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And secondly, Paul can be a little confusing.

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 In 2 Peter 3, the Apostle Peter even says this, where he's like, "We know Paul has written you some letters, and we are confused."

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Does he know that we're fishermen? Because I don't know what he's saying.

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 C.S. Lewis even said, "Out of every gift or all the gifts God gave Paul, clarity was not one of them."

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So we're going to move really slow, and we're going to go through this letter.

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 So we're going to pick it up at verse 1. Here we go. Colossians 1, verse 1.

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy, our brother."

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 So Paul and Timothy are sitting in this prison cell.

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And here we go, verse 2. "To God's holy people in Colossae," so to the church, "the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ, grace and peace to you from God our Father.

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you."

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 So Paul and Timothy are sitting there in the prison cell, got a lot of time on their hands.

112
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 They're praying, and they say, "We always thank God, and here's what we thank Him for when we pray for you.

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Because we've heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all God's people."

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 So we've heard, not only you're full of faith, but you also love people.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 "The faith and love that spring from the hope," faith, love, and hope, "stored up for you in heaven,

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 and about which you have already heard in the message of the gospel that has come to you.

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 In the same way, this gospel that is producing faith and love and hope is bearing fruit in all and growing throughout the whole world."

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 So the gospel has been changing, and it's changed you.

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 "Just as it has," here's where we're going to get to our first point,

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 "Just as it has been among you since the day you heard it and you truly understood God's grace."

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 This brings me to my first point. The source of change is grace.

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Here's what Paul just said, and if you guys want to put that back up there, Daniel, you can put it back.

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 The means by which people change, according to Paul, in this verse, is by understanding or accepting God's grace.

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 This is the thing that changes someone's life.

125
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Think about it. There's a lot of things that, in your world and in my world, would totally change your life.

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 If you woke up tomorrow and they happened, if you won the lottery, you would wake up and things would be different.

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 You would have access to different things.

128
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 If an inheritance was given to you, your life would immediately be changed.

129
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 If a loved one or a parent died, your life would immediately be changed.

130
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Paul says, and the Bible teaches, the most powerful force of change in anyone's life,

131
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 the way Christians become Christians and the way that they grow as Christians, is by accepting God's grace.

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Now, what is God's grace? God's grace is not mercy.

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Mercy is not getting what you deserve.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 You blew it on your job, at your work pace, and you didn't get fired. That would be mercy.

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 You blowing it and getting a promotion would be grace.

136
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Now, God's grace is getting unmerited or undeserved favor, accepting that.

137
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Now, here's the two parts of grace, and if you miss either of them, you'll miss grace entirely.

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 It is accepting the God who has given himself for you, who's given his life for you, that's Jesus,

139
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 and the fact that you did not and do not deserve it.

140
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 It is accepting the God who has given himself for you, that he gave his life, and accepting, I do not deserve it.

141
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 If you deserve grace, it is not grace. It's anything but grace.

142
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 You cannot deserve it. This is at the heart of Paul when he says, you know what changes people?

143
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 The day they realize that God sits in heaven and he doesn't love them because they do good things.

144
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 He doesn't love them because they didn't do bad things.

145
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 The day they begin to change, the day Christians change, is the day they realize God loves them regardless of what they do,

146
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 and then they begin to grow, and then they begin to change.

147
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 That's some of your story in this room, and if that's a foreign concept, and it can be a little philosophical,

148
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 you may think Christianity's all some self-help or like do good and be better.

149
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 The message of the Bible, the Christian message, is not try harder. It's you can't.

150
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 God did not come to give you a second chance, and a second chance, he came to save you.

151
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 That's grace, and the day that you accept, I cannot change myself, Paul says, is the day that everything begins to change.

152
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 So to accept God's grace is to say, I believe and I accept. You gave yourself for me.

153
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And then here's the second part, and it's much harder.

154
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And I do not deserve it. I never have, and I never will.

155
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 That's what Christians believe, and if you meet a Christian who thinks, yeah, but I've kind of earned it, and I'm doing my part,

156
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 they're not a Christian. They're not. That's the message of grace.

157
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Paul says if you add anything, you totally get rid of the gospel, you totally get rid of what Christians believe,

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 as we're going to see for the next few weeks in these chapters as he impacts that idea.

159
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 But this is so huge. This means that no one walks into church, walks and stands before God and goes, ha ha.

160
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 I mean, look at me, man. I know a lot of Bible verses.

161
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 You say, First Peter, I know how to get there in about seven seconds.

162
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 I saved myself from marriage. I give away a lot of money. It's me and God doing this thing together.

163
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 That person is not a Christian. The message of Jesus and the message of the New Testament is that no one deserves it.

164
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Not JP, not me, not you, not Billy Graham, not Mother Teresa.

165
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 That it is only grace, and if you do not accept God's unconditional love,

166
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 despite the fact that you are unworthy of it, if you do not accept both of those, you will not change.

167
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 You will not experience grace. But Paul says, if you do, you begin to step in the direction of change.

168
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 It is the thing that initiates the Christian life, God's grace, God giving himself for you.

169
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 And it is the thing that sustains the Christian life.

170
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 So now Paul brings us to the source of this grace as he continues.

171
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 In verse seven, you learned of it. So speaking about God's grace that's been changing you since you heard it from a path.

172
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 So a path, for us, came, we know, and visited Paul while he was Rome, and while Paul was sitting in Rome in prison,

173
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 and told him, this is what's going on, and this is what's going on in our church.

174
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Our dear fellow servant, who's a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf.

175
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And also he told us of your love in the Spirit.

176
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 For this reason, since the day we have heard about you, again, Paul and Timothy, we have not stopped praying for you.

177
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 We continually ask God, here's what we ask, we go and we pray, and this is what we ask God.

178
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 To fill you with the knowledge of his will through all wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,

179
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way.

180
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power,

181
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 according to his glorious might, so that you may have great endurance and patience.

182
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 The second point is the source of grace is God.

183
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Now here's what I think is interesting about that prayer.

184
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 You may have heard that and you may go, that is the weirdest prayer ever.

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Or you may be going, oh, that's so beautiful.

186
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I kind of agree, it's kind of a little bizarre.

187
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And it's inspired and it's awesome, but let me say it this way.

188
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 If you're hearing that, if you're in Colossae and you're reading it, and you read,

189
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 and is this the most encouraging thing that you can hear from the Apostle Paul?

190
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 We ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and understanding the Spirit gives,

191
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 so you would live a life worthy of him.

192
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Bearing fruit in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power,

193
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 according to his glorious might, so that you may have great endurance and patience.

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I mean, if I'm reading it in Colossae, I'm going, what does that mean?

195
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 What are you talking about, Paul?

196
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And here's even a step further.

197
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 If tomorrow, or I'll just use my own car example.

198
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 If in that moment my car broke down, and I was trying to figure out what am I going to do?

199
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And I have anything, I can't replace this, I can't afford that.

200
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And two friends sent me two different text messages.

201
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Let me ask which one would be more encouraging.

202
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Maybe insert you, if you were in my shoes at that point.

203
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And the first one said, hey man, I just want you to know, I'm praying that God's going to provide you a car.

204
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 I'd get that and go, oh, that is awesome, how great is that?

205
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And the second one said, hey man, I heard you lost your car.

206
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 I'm praying that God would fill you with the knowledge of his will, through all wisdom and understanding,

207
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of him, bearing fruit in every good work,

208
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might,

209
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 so that you would have great endurance and patience.

210
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Which one do you think I would appreciate more?

211
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Right? I mean, why would Paul pray that? That's so bizarre.

212
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Think about the conditions in Colossae were horrible.

213
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Conditions you and I can't even begin to imagine.

214
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 This time, 99% of the empire lives in incredible extreme poverty.

215
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 We know that the economy inside of this city was horrible and falling.

216
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 So most people either didn't have a job, or they were losing their job, or in danger of losing their job.

217
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 On top of that, there's earthquakes going on all the time,

218
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 and there's people trying to force them to worship Mother Nature.

219
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Why, Paul, would you pray for me to have more knowledge of wisdom and the Spirit and understanding?

220
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Why won't you pray for the earthquakes to stop, Paul? Why won't you pray for me to get a job?

221
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Why would you pray that?

222
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I mean, think about it. I'm being serious.

223
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 It's kind of a bizarre prayer.

224
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 But I think Paul points us to something that's really important as it relates to what we need most,

225
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 what they needed most, and even what prayer is for.

226
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Like, he doesn't--it's as though he says, "I don't want to pray for circumstances."

227
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 I mean, I'm not going to pray that God would change the circumstances.

228
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 I'm going to pray that God would change you.

229
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Essentially, what he says is, "I'm praying that you will know God more.

230
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 You will have a deep, profound awareness of Him and what He would have you do in every circumstance."

231
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 That Paul--according to Paul, here's how I, the Apostle Paul, see prayer.

232
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Prayer is not, "Hey, God, will you give me a job?" or "Give me, give me, give me."

233
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Prayer is me asking God to give Him more of Himself and asking that God would take more of me,

234
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 more of my mind, more of my heart.

235
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Prayer is not just, "Hey, will you get some stuff for me or change these things?"

236
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 but, "Will you change me?"

237
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And honestly, it kind of makes sense if you think about it.

238
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Like, circumstances--if you just ask God, "Will you change this circumstance?"

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 There's always going to be, "Will you just--I'm so tired of being single.

240
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Will you bring me a relationship? I'm so tired of working in this job.

241
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Will you get me a promotion? I'm so tired of living in this place.

242
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Will you help me to find another roommate so I can move out?"

243
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 If you just ask God to change circumstances, a couple things happen.

244
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 You always need more prayer for more circumstances.

245
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Like, there's always, "God, will you help me get this relationship?

246
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 God, will you help me to get out of this relationship?

247
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 God, will you help me to find a new roommate? God, I need another new roommate."

248
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 There's always a need for more circumstances.

249
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 It's the--Paul says, "That's not what you need most. It's what you think you need."

250
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 What you need and what I am asking God from a prison cell on my knees

251
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 is that He would give Him more and more of Him to you.

252
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 The same God who graciously and in grace gave Himself for you on the cross

253
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 would give more and more of Himself to you.

254
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 This is the thing that you need more than anything

255
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 because circumstances--if you just pray for circumstances to change,

256
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 if they improve, sometimes that improvement distracts us from God.

257
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Ever thought about that?

258
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Like, "God, will you please just bring me a boyfriend or please bring me a girlfriend?"

259
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And then you get a girlfriend, and now you're distracted from Him.

260
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 It's the flip side.

261
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 "God, will you please just heal this person?"

262
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Genuine, sincere prayers that you should definitely pray.

263
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 "God, will you just change--will you take away the disease?

264
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Will you take away the cancer?"

265
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And then if He doesn't, the circumstances don't change.

266
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Then you're in despair.

267
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And so Paul says, "Look, I'm going beyond circumstances.

268
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I'm praying that despite whatever happens, whatever you face,

269
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 you will know and have a deep awareness of God.

270
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 That is the thing you need most, and you may not even realize it.

271
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 It is the thing we all share in common, and in that moment,

272
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 I would much rather have a car."

273
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 But Paul would say, "That's not what you need most.

274
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 What you need most is more of Him and Him getting more of you.

275
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 That is what prayer is for, and that is what you need more than anything else."

276
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 He continues and gives us really our response to this incredible grace,

277
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 this incredible God who offers us the free gift of eternal life,

278
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 the free gift of His grace in every situation and in every circumstance.

279
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Here's what he says.

280
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 This is our response to God's grace.

281
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 "And giving thanks," verse 12, "and giving joyful thanks to the Father

282
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of His holy people

283
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 and the kingdom of light.

284
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 For He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness.

285
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 He brought us into the kingdom of the Son He loves,

286
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 in whom we have redemption and the forgiveness of sins."

287
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 It's beautiful.

288
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 He says, "Look, here's your response.

289
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Be thankful, joyful and thankful."

290
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Not, "Hey, try harder, do more, join 18 community groups."

291
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Be thankful.

292
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And if you go, "Oh, man, I'm kind of thankful."

293
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 He then goes into these huge statements about,

294
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 "Thankful for all God has done."

295
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 "The Father who has qualified you.

296
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 You did not qualify yourself," he says.

297
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 "The Father," past tense, "qualified you."

298
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 This is what you're to be thankful about.

299
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 He qualified you.

300
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 God rescued you.

301
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 God redeemed you.

302
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 God forgave you.

303
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Everything, ironically, in this passage is huge.

304
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Paul's like, "Your God is big.

305
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Your sin is big."

306
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 It's colossal, to use the colosse term.

307
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Everything about it is huge.

308
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 He says, "Your rescue is big.

309
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Your new identity is big."

310
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 The idea of even dominion of darkness,

311
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 so we're gonna walk through a couple of these changes

312
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 that God has done, where it says, "He's rescued you.

313
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 He qualified you, not because of anything you've done.

314
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 He rescued you from the dominion of darkness."

315
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 When I read that, I'm like, "Dominion of darkness?

316
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I was under the power of darkness?

317
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Really, Paul?

318
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Are you sure?

319
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 I live in America.

320
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Are you talking about ISIS right now?"

321
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 I feel like that's a little bit more dominion of darkness.

322
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 I don't know that I was in the dominion of darkness.

323
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Here's what I think he's saying.

324
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 The dominion of darkness,

325
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Satan poses as an angel of light.

326
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 It's not looking like you think it would look.

327
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 He says, "God has rescued you."

328
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 The dominion of darkness is worshiping anyone or anything

329
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 other than the one true God.

330
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 He's rescued you from that,

331
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 because that, if you worship anyone or anything,

332
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 will always lead to darkness.

333
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 In our country, the dominion of darkness,

334
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 really, I would say, is the God of self,

335
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 the American dream.

336
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Pursue what makes you happy.

337
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Do what you think you should do.

338
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Do what's right for you.

339
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 No one can say what's really right for everyone.

340
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Do whatever you think you should do.

341
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Here's where I just want to add,

342
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 this is what leads to the dominion of darkness here.

343
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Can we agree on something for a second?

344
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Can we all agree that it's not working?

345
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 The more that you and I do whatever we want to do,

346
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 whatever feels good,

347
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 the more that I just do whatever I think I should do,

348
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 the more people get hurt,

349
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 the more debt gets racked up,

350
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 the more casual sex takes place and scars are made,

351
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 the more damage is done in our world.

352
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And it leads to darkness.

353
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 The more hollow we feel,

354
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 and Paul says, "I know why.

355
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 "Because you're still worshiping someone

356
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 "other than the one true God."

357
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And it always leads to darkness.

358
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 But he's rescued those of us who are in Christ from that,

359
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 and he's brought us into the kingdom of light.

360
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And that word brought, I love it,

361
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 because it's the same word for deported.

362
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 He brought you from one kingdom into another kingdom.

363
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Which must be like the first time in human history,

364
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 or in history, that someone was deported

365
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 out of a bad country into a good country.

366
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 We don't just deport tons of people back to America

367
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 from third world countries.

368
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 It just doesn't happen.

369
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 You deport, and usually you're deported

370
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 from a place that you want to be.

371
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And Paul says, "No, God stepped into that dominion of darkness

372
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 "and he pulled you out of it, and he rescued you,

373
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 "and he did it.

374
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 "You didn't do anything.

375
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 "As good as you think you are, you did nothing."

376
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And he says, "You don't deserve it, and neither do I."

377
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 And our response is joyfully giving thanks,

378
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 which I think is ironically really hard for a lot of us.

379
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Like the more I follow Christ, the longer I'm a Christian,

380
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 the more I begin to think, "I'm a pretty good person.

381
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 "I think God should probably want me on my team."

382
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 The more, and maybe many of you in the room right now,

383
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 like your response, even to this message,

384
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 is not like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so thankful, Lord.

385
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 "Grace, I know I've been a Christian

386
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 "since I was a little kid, but this is so refreshing.

387
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 "I'm overwhelmed how good you are."

388
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 You're just going, "Really?

389
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 "Can we get something other than grace in here?

390
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 "I want to learn something.

391
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 "Can we try something in the Old Testament

392
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 "for once in a while?"

393
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Because you have grown cold.

394
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And Paul says the response should be

395
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 for all believers the same, joyful gratitude

396
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 that you did not deserve it, and I don't deserve it.

397
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 But despite, even there's a word for people

398
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 that are not grateful when they're given something,

399
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 entitled, entitled.

400
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 And Paul says, "Look, let the overwhelming work

401
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 "that God has done for you not allow you

402
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 "to become entitled, but let it move you

403
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 "to be thankful to him."

404
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 That's your role.

405
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 He says, "God did this, God did this."

406
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Your role, be thankful, be thankful.

407
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 There was a man named Martin Luther

408
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 who started the Reformation, and honestly,

409
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 part of the reason we're in this room right now,

410
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 and started Protestantism, and talks about this idea,

411
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 really the opposite of entitlement.

412
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 He talks about how we're so unworthy,

413
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 and yet we're so welcomed, despite all of those things.

414
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 It's hard for us to even see how unworthy we are.

415
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And he says what I'm about to read on his deathbed,

416
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 and he doesn't even say it.

417
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 By the time the moment had come,

418
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 he'd lost the ability to speak.

419
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 He couldn't speak.

420
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 He was literally, very shortly, gonna die,

421
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 and he asked for some pen and paper.

422
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And he reaches out his hand, and on his right,

423
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 he writes the last words we have from Martin Luther.

424
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 He says, "We are beggars, this is true."

425
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And then he died.

426
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 That we are beggars who have been welcomed

427
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 to the table of God.

428
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 We don't bring anything to the table,

429
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 we bring nothing.

430
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And yet God has lavishly loved us,

431
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 despite the fact that all of our brokenness,

432
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 despite the fact that we still think

433
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 we're pretty good people,

434
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 despite the fact that we're entitled.

435
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 He loves you, and he died for you.

436
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And he offers that free gift of grace

437
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 to anyone who will accept it.

438
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 So tonight, our hope and prayer for this message,

439
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 and really this book,

440
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 is that some of you will accept that grace

441
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 for the first time.

442
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 That is the single decision that you will make

443
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 that will totally change the trajectory of your life.

444
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 The free gift, Paul says,

445
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 that's when people begin to change.

446
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Not when they say, "I'm gonna really try harder,

447
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 "I'm trying to get back in church."

448
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 But when they say, "I surrender, I can't.

449
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 "I'm accepting the free gift.

450
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 "I'm not a good person.

451
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 "I think I'm a good person, but I'm not a good person.

452
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 "I need a savior.

453
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 "A God who gave himself for me, who was undeserving.

454
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 "And I'm accepting that free gift."

455
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Tonight is the night for some of you,

456
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 and we wanna talk to you afterwards.

457
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Because if you have not stepped into that relationship,

458
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 there, I don't know how else to say this.

459
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Buckle up when you drive.

460
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 I'm being serious.

461
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 There is a,

462
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 you cannot be too safe.

463
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 God's grace will always be there tomorrow.

464
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 He does not promise you will be there tomorrow.

465
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And today, on March 17th, or whatever it is, 2015,

466
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 you have been told about the free gift.

467
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 You will no longer stand before God, who loves you,

468
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 who spread his arms and died for you,

469
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 and say, "I never heard about the free gift."

470
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And tonight, he says, "Will you come and take it?

471
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 "Will you come accept it?

472
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 "You can't do anything to earn it.

473
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 "You could never afford it.

474
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 "I've given it out for free for everyone."

475
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 It's the thing that makes Christianity different

476
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 from every other world religion there is.

477
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 It's not about what you do.

478
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 It's about what God has done.

479
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And tonight is your night to accept it.

480
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And so buckle up,

481
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 if you don't wanna come down and talk about it and receive it.

482
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 And I'm not saying that to be hurtful or to be mean.

483
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 I'm being serious.

484
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I've said that to close friends of mine

485
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 who have waited and waited and waited,

486
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 and you never know how many more days you have.

487
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 But God has given you today, and he's crazy about you.

488
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 The second thing, I think some of us

489
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 who are believers in the room, we just need to apply it.

490
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 We need to continue to remember

491
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 whether you're walking through a season

492
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 just where you're covered in shame

493
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 from a past abortion, a current addiction,

494
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 maybe a string of just past sexual relationships

495
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 that you just carry guilt from.

496
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And for you, Paul says, be free.

497
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Free enough where you can even walk in the light

498
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 and talk about it.

499
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 God's freed you from those things.

500
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 You don't have to carry the guilt.

501
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 There may be pain that life brings about,

502
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 and there's ways that God has given us

503
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 to find healing and hope.

504
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 But for you, the message is just to apply that grace,

505
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 the grace of God who loves you with all your faults.

506
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And perfectly accepts you right where you are.

507
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And will perfectly accept anyone

508
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 who will accept his free gift, his grace,

509
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 his giving of himself.

510
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 The story honestly ends with that car,

511
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 in a way that was awesome.

512
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And I got a phone call from someone later that day.

513
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 So my car's broken down, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

514
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 And they call and they say,

515
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 "Someone told me your car's broke down.

516
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 "I have a car you can have."

517
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 I'm like, "What, is this a joke right now?

518
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 "This is not a funny joke if it is a joke."

519
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 And he says, "No, I have a car."

520
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I'm like, "What do you mean you have a car?"

521
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 "Yeah, I have a car, you can have it.

522
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 "Just come get it.

523
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 "Come take it."

524
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 I'm like, "Well, let me see it."

525
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 I show up, I'm like, "This is awesome.

526
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 "Are you serious right now?

527
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 "Can I pay you?"

528
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 And in my mind, I'm going, "I can't afford to pay him.

529
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 "I've got a $500 clunker back here.

530
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 "What am I gonna pay him with?"

531
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 "I can't afford that."

532
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 He's like, "No, you can't pay me."

533
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And then he even said,

534
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 "The only thing I ask is just don't tell people

535
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 "specifically who gave it to you."

536
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 And I'm like, "What, you don't even want the credit?"

537
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 If I give away a car, I'm like,

538
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 "Giving away a car.

539
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 "Just want everyone to see.

540
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 "David's car going over here.

541
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 "Giving away a license plate, David's gift.

542
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 "Giving away a car.

543
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 "Be blessed."

544
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Right?

545
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And they're like, "No, I just don't want anyone

546
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 "to know.

547
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 "Just take the free gift."

548
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 And that's God's message to you and to me.

549
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 He says, "Look, I've already purchased it.

550
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 "I've already paid for it.

551
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 "Everything that you've ever done,

552
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 "every mistake that you've ever made

553
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 "has been paid for by my son dying on a cross for you."

554
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 And some of you need to know this

555
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 because you may be abusing grace.

556
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 You may be avoiding grace.

557
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 What you need to hear is that grace is not a principle.

558
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Grace is a person.

559
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 His name is Jesus.

560
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Jesus is the personification of grace.

561
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 John 1 tells us, "Jesus came and he was full.

562
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 "He was the fullness of grace.

563
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 "And from his grace, we have received grace upon grace."

564
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 John 1 16 says.

565
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Jesus, grace is not some principle.

566
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 You may have met some concept, some idea.

567
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Grace is a person.

568
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 You do not even have to go looking for grace.

569
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 If you're in the room, grace is looking for you.

570
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 That's why you're here.

571
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 Will you accept it if you haven't?

572
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 And then for the rest of us,

573
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 what a gift to be able to just apply it,

574
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 continue to walk into God,

575
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 despite all of our messed up,

576
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 all the things in my heart that are messed up,

577
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 all the moments on the stage where I want you to like me,

578
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 or I'm directed and governed by just like me,

579
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 or any million moments between now and the time I get home,

580
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 or when I get home,

581
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 all the different things that run through my veins

582
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 and course through my heart that are just broken.

583
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And God says, "You're more worthy than you understand,

584
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 "more loved than you'll ever realize."

585
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 That's my grace.

586
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 My son paid for it.

587
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 We come and meet the person who is grace.

588
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 Father, we love you.

589
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 We love you.

590
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Many of us do.

591
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Many of us would if we knew you.

592
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 And pray for anyone right now

593
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 that you have not yet established relationship with.

594
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Would your hand be heavy on their heart?

595
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Not so they would feel bad,

596
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 but so they would know you.

597
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Thank you for your grace.

598
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 One thank you just even seems silly

599
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 for you giving me your son.

600
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 But thank you.

601
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 We love you.

602
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 Would you continue to increase that joyful gratitude

603
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 in the hearts of my friends who know you,

604
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 and would you right now capture the hearts of those who don't.

605
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 In Jesus's name, we're saved and we pray.

606
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Amen.
