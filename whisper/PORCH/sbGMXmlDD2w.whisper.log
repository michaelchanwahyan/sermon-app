[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.420]   - Love it, welcome friends in the room.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.260]   Gosh.
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.080]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.280]   And friends in Fort Worth and El Paso
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.040]   and wherever else you are, it's flooding outside.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.520]   And it's gonna be a great night.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.560]   We're gonna talk and continue this series
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.860]   for the next 30 to 35 minutes.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.080]   I'm gonna start with a story that'll give us
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.980]   some traction for where we're going.
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.240]   A few years ago, a girl on our staff now,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.360]   but at the time was interviewing to have a position,
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.880]   interviewed and applied at Watermark
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.680]   and she lived in Cocoa Beach, Florida.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   And so as she was going through the process,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.080]   we hadn't met her yet and really didn't know her.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.840]   We were connected with other people on our staff
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.600]   who said she had interest in applying and she applied
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.200]   and we want your team to set up a conference call
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.320]   or a Skype and get some time with her on the phone.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.840]   So we set up kind of an interview with her as a team
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.440]   and our administrative person set up
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.480]   and coordinated all six people on the young adults team
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.260]   and got us all in a room, conference phone there
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.620]   and we made the call.
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.640]   So I began to call and her name is Elena.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.400]   And so we took out the big conference kind of phone,
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.920]   you put it right in the middle and you dial it up
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.120]   and you dial the number and they were calling
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.400]   and ring, ring, ring, she doesn't answer.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.480]   So I leave a message going, hey, Elena, this is David.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.120]   I'm with the young adult team here
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.020]   at the porch in Dallas.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.820]   I think we're supposed to have a phone conversation
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.160]   or a phone interview right now.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.000]   So I hope you're doing well.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.480]   If you get this message in the next few minutes,
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.860]   call us back and I share the Watermark phone line
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.700]   and let us know and we're looking forward to it.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.920]   Hang up.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.760]   And then our team begins to engage
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.520]   in somewhat playful like speculation, if you will,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.200]   about like, oh, Cocoa Beach, I wonder what she's doing
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.440]   and everything from like, oh man,
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.240]   she's totally on the beach right now
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.200]   and one girl's like, oh, I bet she's like having Mai Tais
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.400]   and just hanging out tanning.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   I know Florida girls.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.960]   This is what they're like, I'm telling you.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.420]   And she's like, Christianity is just different out there.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.760]   I went to Auburn, I know.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.760]   And it was like total just, oh man, yeah, I'm sure it was
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.600]   and all in playful fun.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.080]   And then we hear this, to send your message, press two.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.000]   To erase and re-record, press three.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.480]   And it's like the room went silent.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.380]   Oh my gosh.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.280]   I'm gonna as carefully as possible, press three right now.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.000]   Three.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.640]   Re-record after the tone.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.840]   Hey, Elena, this is David from the watermark.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.320]   I'm in the porch, just really,
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.400]   believe we're supposed to have a phone conversation.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.520]   And then it ends and it's like,
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.040]   what were we supposed to say to make it hang up?
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.880]   Is it pound?
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   How do we send this one through and make sure?
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.600]   And the terror is striking us of like,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.400]   what if somehow the other one
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.040]   is already being listened to right now?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.360]   How does that even work?
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.920]   What is it, sprint 18-2?
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.300]   What phone system even has the whole like,
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.420]   press two at the end thing?
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.620]   And we're trying to figure out, confirm,
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.040]   man, hopefully the right message went through.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.540]   And it was a reminder.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.480]   And what ended up happening,
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.700]   here's what's even funnier part of the story,
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.820]   is she was, our administrative assistant
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.920]   had coordinated all of our schedules
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.840]   and no one had ever reached out to her.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.620]   So she was just at work that day.
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.340]   There was nothing going on at all.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.740]   And we laughed, she ended up coming on her staff
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.680]   and we would laugh about it now,
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.700]   but at the time it was another reminder
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.900]   or reminder of the lesson of the danger
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.240]   of talking about people behind their back
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.480]   and talking negatively about people behind their back.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.020]   I mean, think how damaging that would have been
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.220]   had she got that message and been like,
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.280]   man, I'm done with this church.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.240]   I don't wanna interview here.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.440]   I don't wanna be a part of this ministry.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.540]   And these people are just mean.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.740]   And that Auburn girl, she's got something coming.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.120]   And think of what could have happened.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.480]   And the reason I start there is 'cause tonight
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.880]   we're gonna talk about the vice of gossip.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.360]   We're in this series called Vice and Virtue
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.520]   where we're exploring cultural vices
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.120]   and biblical virtues to compliment or to go with them.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.080]   Really what the Bible says
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.880]   we should replace those vices with.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.000]   And gossip is the topic for tonight.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.880]   Everyone's favorite topic.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.520]   And the reason why, and that's a joke by the way,
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.640]   I don't think anyone's favorite topic is,
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.380]   yes, please, gossip, that's my favorite.
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.640]   And tonight we're gonna explore
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.120]   what I think many of us already know about,
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.180]   the crazy thing about gossip is it almost goes without saying
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.240]   we all know it's not a good thing.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.640]   We all know that it's damaging to relationships specifically.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.240]   The reason why the Bible is so anti-gossip
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.140]   and the reason why even your experience has taught you
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.640]   and you know from your own experience
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.600]   gossip is not a good thing and it's not a good thing
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.680]   because it is so destructive
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.640]   towards relationships with people.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.960]   That in the history of the world
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.000]   there's never been any two people who are like,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.760]   you know what the secret sauce of us being so close is?
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.800]   We talk bad about each other behind their back.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.080]   Like that doesn't happen.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.280]   It's not a recipe for success and it destroys relationships.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.160]   All of us from very early on in age,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.280]   we are taught, hey, if you don't have anything nice to say,
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.680]   don't say anything at all.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.880]   These people were taught that early on.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.400]   The rest of you, good luck.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.320]   But we know that it's dangerous
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.760]   because it can be so destructive
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.320]   towards relationships with one another.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.000]   But tonight we're gonna explore even more so
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.040]   why God is so anti-gossip.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.280]   I mean inside of passages we see in the Bible,
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.680]   he includes it in lists of sins.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.240]   Like there's these different places where God says,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.960]   hey, here's what the expressions of an evil person
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.020]   will have inside of their heart.
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.400]   Romans chapter one being one of them.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.120]   We're in the list, Paul says,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.360]   man, a expression of an evil man
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.600]   is someone whose life is full of murder,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.520]   strife, deceit, maliciousness, and gossip.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.960]   I mean it's something that God takes very seriously
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.520]   and the reason he takes it so seriously
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.560]   is because as we've all experienced,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.220]   it is toxic towards relationships
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.420]   and it is destructive towards relationships.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.320]   Some of you, your biggest hurts in life
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.880]   have come in this season or in high school
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.880]   or in college or maybe with coworkers
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.580]   because somebody talked bad about you and you found out.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.280]   Somebody said something that wasn't true.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.800]   Somebody said something that was hurtful.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.680]   Somebody said something that you ended up finding out about
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.200]   and it created such a wound.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.280]   And so before we go any further,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.360]   let me just define gossip.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   By gossip, I mean very specifically
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.920]   talking negatively about someone behind their back
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.200]   to someone who's not a part of the problem
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.040]   and not a part of the solution.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.720]   It's often based on rumors which makes it even worse
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.840]   but it is talking negatively about others
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.180]   from behind their back.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.480]   And the crazy thing, despite the fact
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.800]   that we all know it's so bad, I mean, everybody does it.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.840]   Even on church staff.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.260]   Sometimes churches, you know, Christians
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.120]   are the worst at this.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.440]   Maybe you're back in church for the first time
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.760]   in a long time or first time ever
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.600]   and part of the problem you have with God or with church
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.320]   is because you got in the mix of Christians
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.440]   that were judgmental and full of gossip
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.360]   and they didn't just hurt your perspective on them,
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.000]   they hurt your perspective on Christianity, on God.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.200]   And so tonight, hopefully we're gonna hear from God's word
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.760]   how that was never a part of his desire.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.680]   He does not want his people to be marked
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.080]   by the quality of gossip.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.480]   We're gonna look specifically at how you and I
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.360]   can remove gossip from our life
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.200]   but before we go there, we're gonna look at the reasons
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.440]   why we gossip biblically, the results of gossip
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.320]   inside of our life and the way that you and I can remove it.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.440]   We live in a culture that doesn't just tolerate gossip,
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.560]   it celebrates it.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   I mean, let's be honest, like between The Bachelor
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.480]   and Entertainment News and People Magazine,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.520]   it's like all about what's the latest tidbit
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   and juicy info and it is destroying the church
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.160]   when Christians who claim the name of Jesus
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.720]   allow gossip to be a part of their life.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.760]   And so we're gonna dive in and explore the reason,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   the reason, the reason and the result
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.360]   and the remedy for gossip today.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.680]   So here we go, this comes from Proverbs 18a
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.500]   as we talk about the reasons why we gossip.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.520]   It says this, the words of a gossip,
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.760]   this is Solomon writing in Proverbs chapter 18.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.680]   Proverbs is essentially the book of wisdom
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.080]   on how you can live a life that is in line
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.400]   with God's design and it says this,
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.400]   the words of a gossip are like choice or delicious morsels
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.040]   that go into the innermost parts.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.840]   Solomon says, here's why gossip,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.900]   here's the reason why gossip is so alluring,
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.020]   here's the reason why gossip is something that,
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.120]   despite the fact that everyone thinks it's a bad thing,
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.280]   so many of us do it, so many of us find ourselves
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.120]   talking negatively about, oh my gosh,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.960]   can you believe that Sarah did X
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.140]   or man, did you see she leased a Mercedes?
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.620]   I thought she was having money problems.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.640]   It's so easy for any of us to step into it
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.880]   and even to wanna be on the receiving end
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.600]   or to be on the receiving end and just tolerate it
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.520]   and allow it in our life.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.560]   Solomon says the reason why is because
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.600]   there's something about gossip where it is like
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   delicious morsels inside of your life or inside of mine.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.120]   It's like this delicious food that,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.640]   man, I just want some of that.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.980]   So these are cake balls made by a girl named Stephanie Morgan
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.200]   and they're like the best thing of all time.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.160]   By far, my favorite dessert, if I was gonna eat something,
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.260]   it probably would be these or something like ice cream.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.740]   They make cake look like it should no longer
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.020]   be baked ever again because of how good these things are.
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.380]   And she'll make them and it's hard to resist.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.860]   I mean, I'll find myself, if they're around me,
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.860]   I just can't help but wanna dive in and eat 'em
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.700]   and Solomon says that just like a delicious morsel
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.780]   is gossip, the words of gossip.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.340]   Hearing about others and negative things
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.460]   inside of their life is like there's something seductive
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.900]   or in a weird way, appealing about it.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.860]   And there's all kinds of reasons why it's appealing.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.740]   For some of us, it's like there's just something
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.780]   and think about how sick this is.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.020]   There's something about hearing about your shortcomings
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.720]   that makes me feel better about myself.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.220]   Like one of the reasons why we gossip
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.620]   underneath the reasons of gossip
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.540]   is it's like it's a self-esteem boost.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.700]   For you, it may be, oh man, it's like it makes me feel better
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.380]   to hear about their relationship falling apart.
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.220]   Tell me more, how's it going?
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.000]   For others, it's all related.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.820]   (coughs)
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.580]   I can't do that anymore.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.300]   It's all related to pride.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.200]   If there's something inside of it
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.160]   where it just feeds pride inside of us,
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.340]   maybe it's just entertaining.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.240]   A lot of times, especially ladies,
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.860]   it can be just out of boredom.
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.200]   I'm entertained and we're kind of bonding over this.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.860]   It's something we do together.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.660]   And that's the reason we gossip.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.960]   Other times, it's because it hurts.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.500]   The reason I will talk bad about someone behind their back
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.700]   is because at some point, they hurt me
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.300]   and I feel almost justified in talking badly about them.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.780]   This is just how they are.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.220]   I've experienced them before.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.580]   I've worked with her before.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.700]   You just need to watch out for this.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.400]   And we feel almost justified in it.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.980]   Whatever it is, there's all these different reasons
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.660]   why it's almost appealing.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.500]   Sometimes it's just, man, I feel,
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.540]   I wanna be approved or accepted.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.820]   I have this like people-pleasing thing in me
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.900]   and I feel like important when I'm sharing
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.940]   insider information about someone.
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.580]   You know what, all of the reasons why we gossip,
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.600]   whatever yours would be, all of them have in common,
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.580]   is they're all bad.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.420]   Like there's no excuse, there's no good reason
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.780]   biblically to gossip or talk negatively about someone
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.580]   who's not there behind their back ever.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.380]   Like it's almost the genius of the illustration,
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.100]   candidly for Solomon, where he's like,
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.660]   dude, in the same way that these are delicious
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.200]   and they are incredible to eat,
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.060]   they're also really bad for you.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.380]   Have you ever noticed that like,
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.500]   there's this weird thing about the wiring of the universe
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.420]   as it relates to food.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.900]   For whatever reason, we'll find this out someday.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.960]   When God created the world as it relates to food,
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.140]   it's like everything that tastes so good
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.460]   is so bad for you.
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.420]   And everything that tastes so bad is so good for you.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.220]   Like kale, last week I had a kale salad.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.340]   This is the most disgusting plant I've ever eaten before.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.740]   I mean, it's the worst lettuce that's out there.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.920]   And yet it's so, I'm gonna live an extra five years,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.780]   I think, for eating that.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.980]   Because for whatever reason, that's how God made the world
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.060]   where he's like, man, everything that's so good like this
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.960]   is so terrible for you and everything that doesn't taste
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.680]   great is so good for you.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.060]   And Solomon would say, man, that's exactly how gossip is.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.080]   It tastes so good going down.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.180]   You won't even realize it.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.720]   It's so appealing, it's appetizing.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.220]   Yes, tell me more, what's going on with her?
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.480]   Oh my gosh, I can't believe that.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.800]   Yeah, we should pray for her.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.040]   And it feels so good to hear about it 'cause it soothes,
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.840]   honestly, it soothes kind of my insecurities
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.920]   about like, oh really?
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.520]   Gosh, that's gotta be rough.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.680]   I mean, man, poor girl, poor guy.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.240]   And it just makes me feel better.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.220]   And Solomon says, hey, not only is it delicious,
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.660]   just like a delicious food, it's really bad for you
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.780]   and it goes deep into your heart.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.740]   Unlike these that, you know, if you eat too many sweets
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.860]   or too many delicious morsels, I think we've all experienced
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.420]   this before, something called the freshman 15
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.420]   or the, you know, the 30-year-old 15
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.460]   and then the 31-year-old 15 or whatever,
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.780]   insert wherever your stage of life is.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.420]   But where you just, if you consume things
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.280]   that may taste good, what happens?
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.900]   They end up hanging around in not convenient places.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.940]   Like, and you end up having them stick with you.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.620]   If you eat unhealthy things, they stick with you.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.940]   Solomon's point is just like that,
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.660]   but they're not gonna hang around and be extra weight
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.480]   that is gonna make you need to change your genes.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.980]   They're gonna hang around and latch into your heart.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.260]   Gossip goes deep into your heart
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.660]   and it poisons you at the deepest level.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.740]   And it feeds, here's why it's so dangerous,
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.280]   is it feeds the reason why you're gossiping.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.400]   Like, if you gossip because you have an addiction
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.760]   or approval, the approval of man, you will feed,
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.560]   the more you gossip, it's gonna feed that into your heart.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.440]   If you gossip because of bitterness
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.520]   or hurt towards other people,
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.200]   you're gonna do that more and more and more.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.760]   Whatever the reason that you gossip is,
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.480]   it goes deep into your heart and it feeds that,
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.460]   Solomon would say.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.000]   It's gonna stick around with you,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.720]   just like eating a diet of not healthy things
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.640]   sticks with you and ends up showing up
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.780]   and having consequences.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.100]   So it is with gossip in your life and in my life
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.140]   and that's not the only.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.460]   So the reason, and the reasons for gossip are not good,
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.140]   but there are also other results
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.620]   than just it sticks with you that the Bible tells us about.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.180]   So then the second idea we're talking about
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.860]   is the results of gossip.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.460]   What are the results of gossip?
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.820]   We've mentioned a couple of 'em,
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.560]   but one that we've all seen is broken relationships.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.180]   The first result that we see very clearly in Scripture
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.900]   is broken relationships are as a result of gossip.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.580]   Here's what Proverbs 16, 28 says.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.300]   A troublemaker plants seeds of strife
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.460]   and a gossip separates the best of friends.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.280]   That a gossip can separate and gossip that information,
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.720]   talking negatively about someone's behind their back
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.360]   can do such damage that even the closest of friends
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.400]   are susceptible to allowing gossip to come in
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.520]   and divide them apart.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.940]   Even the closest community group,
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.600]   even the most godly Christian people are susceptible
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.720]   if they tolerate gossip or live kind of around people
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.360]   who allow gossip to experience that coming in
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.360]   and dividing a wedge between them.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.400]   There's an expression that we've heard before,
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.380]   maybe you haven't, called loose lips sink ships.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.860]   Loose lips sink ships.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:09.760]   That's actually an expression
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.340]   that came about in World War II.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.260]   The United States had all these different naval fleets
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.140]   and they were trying to make sure that no German spies
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.120]   got on and were a spy and really posing
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.140]   as an American soldier on those boats
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.040]   and then those German spies got information and passed it on.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.120]   So they came up with a phrase called loose lips sink ships.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.920]   And the point of the whole thing was,
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.560]   hey, don't let this information go to even a single person
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.720]   that it doesn't need to go to.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.360]   It only goes as far as it's very intended clearly to go.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.320]   Only the absolute necessary number of people
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.960]   or people that have been designated
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.240]   are the ones who need this information.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.580]   We don't share it with anybody else
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.780]   because loose lips sink ships,
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.240]   as in like they could sink this boat
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.920]   that we're on right now if it gets in the wrong hands.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.640]   In the same way, this is what happens inside of the church
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.680]   or inside of any relationship where loose lips sink ships.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.400]   Only this time, stay with me,
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.720]   it's friend ships and relationships.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.200]   I know, see what we did there?
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.720]   And it's true.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.500]   As much as information being dangerous
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.800]   that it's gonna take down the USS whatever,
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.600]   when gossip or when someone has the heart of the gossip
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.560]   is spreading information out there,
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.180]   even if it's true, but they're gossiping,
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.780]   negatively talking about people behind their back,
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:29.620]   they are toxic and that girl is poison, that guy is poison.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.880]   And it is destructive towards relationships.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.180]   Think about your workplace environment.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.060]   Think about the relationships that exist
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.120]   and the dynamics that exist inside of your workplace
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.340]   and how much negative conversation
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.420]   or how much talking bad about people
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.980]   is contributing to just like all the tension
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.980]   and dysfunction and relational unhealth that exists there.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.140]   In fact, the Bible even says that it is gossip
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.940]   that is responsible for conflicts a lot of the time.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.900]   Here's what it says in Proverbs 26, 20.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.540]   That without gossip or without wood, a fire goes out
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.960]   and without a gossip, a quarrel or a conflict will die down
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.500]   in the same way that, hey, if you had a fire,
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.220]   you lit one outside and the moment it runs out of wood,
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.580]   the fire begins to kind of die out and just dwindle away.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.100]   The same thing happens with gossip.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.220]   When people begin to go around and talk negatively
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.380]   and say, man, did you hear about X person
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.940]   and I think they're about to sell the company
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.300]   and here's what I think's gonna happen.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.580]   Really, Beverly, she's the problem.
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.960]   When that happens, Solomon says,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.760]   that's the cause of the fuel that conflict runs on.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.180]   I mean, when you look around your life
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.560]   and you look around the tension that you feel
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.120]   with family friends, with community group,
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.520]   with different people, how different,
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.000]   with people at your workplace,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.920]   how different would those conflicts be
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.840]   if you never ever talked about someone behind their back
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.160]   and no one you worked with ever talked about someone
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.060]   behind their back?
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:05.520]   How different would your perception of your boss be
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.160]   if no one talked negatively about him behind his back?
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.480]   I mean, think about it.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.560]   I mean, some of you, like the vast majority
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.120]   of what you know about the people that you work with
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.240]   or the people that you're kind of connected with,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.940]   let's just say in the work environment,
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.560]   the vast majority of maybe directors or people
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.720]   that you kind of cross paths with,
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.080]   but your perception of them is not because
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.000]   of your interactions with them have created it.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.720]   Often it's because of negative words
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.800]   that other people have shared with them.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.640]   Hey, be careful.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.660]   I'm just telling you, if you work with this guy,
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.100]   this is what you can expect.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.540]   And for Christians, it is not acceptable.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.500]   And it is an offense towards God
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.740]   because you make your Christian faith look like it
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.340]   has no part of the way that you use your tongue.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.080]   It destroys relationships.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:03.540]   It not only does that, it poisons perspective.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.660]   It poisons your perspective.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.700]   Anytime that you hear gossip
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.860]   or anytime that you share gossiping,
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.900]   you're poisoning the perspective of someone else.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.860]   And just same way that anytime you hear gossip,
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.380]   you're poisoning or you're receiving a poison perspective,
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.460]   just like I said with that boss.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.860]   I mean, here's how powerful this is.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.220]   Let's imagine right now that the person
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.000]   that you're sitting next to, as I'm talking,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.860]   leaned over and said, hey, you know what?
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.300]   I heard that he's embezzling
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.060]   or stealing money from the church.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.900]   Or hey, I heard that offstage,
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.740]   like he looks like he may be a nice guy,
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.460]   but he's a real jerk.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.820]   That's what I heard.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.860]   How would that impact the way that you listen
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.300]   to what I'm saying right now?
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.220]   I mean, of course, it'd be like, really?
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.500]   He's a big jerk.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.460]   Man, yeah, that's what I heard.
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.460]   Based totally on a rumor.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.960]   I mean, people will leave Watermark based on a rumor.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.340]   Think about that.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.340]   I'm leaving this church
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.780]   because of what I heard from someone from gossip.
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.360]   I mean, it is destructive.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:02.500]   I'm leaving, I'm making spiritual decisions
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.480]   that is the most important part of my life
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.020]   based on gossip that I hear from people around me.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.500]   If you are spreading gossip,
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.260]   you're spreading an infection that is toxic to the church.
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.120]   It's like spreading cancer within it.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.840]   And it can hide behind this kind of subtle,
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.220]   like it's not that big of a deal
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.200]   and it's just kind of how we bond.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.300]   It is a big deal.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.680]   It's a big deal to God.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.380]   And it is toxic.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.060]   And it has sadly been the thing
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.940]   that I've never heard of a church being torn apart
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.680]   because of adultery.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.840]   I've never heard of it.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.920]   Adultery will come in and it can be a big part
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.400]   and man, it's sad and tragic.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.880]   But you know what tears churches apart all the time?
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.720]   Gossip.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.880]   And it's poisoning your perspective
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.480]   and it poisons my perspective
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.760]   anytime that I hear gossip.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.480]   It's impossible for it to not change
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.320]   the way that I see something once I hear about it.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.840]   Result number three is it corrupts your character.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.660]   It corrupts your character.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.560]   Here's what Proverbs 11, verses 12 and 13 says.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.180]   "A gossip goes around telling secrets."
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.740]   It's not that a gossip goes around telling things
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.860]   that are not true or telling things that are true.
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.980]   A gossip goes around telling secrets.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.900]   But those who are trustworthy can keep a confidence.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.700]   They're able to restrain their tongue.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.620]   They're wise over when they share things
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.060]   and what they share and who they would share things with.
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.980]   That's what a trustworthy person does.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.460]   An untrustworthy person,
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.340]   a person who has character problems is a gossip.
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.180]   And it is corrupting your character.
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.960]   And even the fact that I think most of us
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.440]   think it's not a big deal reflects
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.380]   that's how corrupted our character has become.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:47.760]   Man, gossip is such a funny message to talk about
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.620]   'cause at some level it may be the most participated
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.700]   in vice in this whole series.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.720]   But you know what happens after a message on gossip?
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.860]   Like after a message on lust or sexuality
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.700]   or man, anger and you know,
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.340]   dealing with any number of things.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.620]   There's always, there'll be tons of people
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.980]   that wanna come down and it's awesome
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.300]   and it's really encouraging and just man,
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.300]   that's part of my story and I wanna talk through that.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.860]   And I just wanna find healing from you know,
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.900]   my same sex attraction or the abortion that I had
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   or just I'm trying to work through forgiving my parents
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.900]   and all kinds of different things
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.820]   that people wanna talk through
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.740]   after topics like last week on lust
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.380]   or after topics that fit kinda
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.720]   into any of the bigger buckets.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.460]   Gossip is probably more widely participated in
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.460]   by the church, by any of us in this room
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.340]   than any of those topics.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.060]   But you know what's gonna happen after a message like this?
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.620]   It happens every time.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.980]   Is nobody's coming down and being like,
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:43.020]   "Oh my gosh, I just have been carrying guilt for so long.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.820]   "I'm devastated that I'm a gossip.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.240]   "I've never once even, apart from us covering it
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.860]   "in a specific message, I've never had someone
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.100]   "come down front and pull me aside
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.700]   "and be like, I just need to confess.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.300]   "I just feel like I've been too loose
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.660]   "with my words recently."
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.740]   Here's why.
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.640]   Because we have a corrupted character.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.420]   Like, I don't even think it's that big of a deal.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.460]   Said another way, I have silenced the conviction
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.080]   of the Holy Spirit so many times
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.700]   that I've become immune to it.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:13.260]   And it's tragic.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.420]   And it's disgusting.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.580]   In other words, the Holy Spirit,
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.020]   it's not that, if you have the Spirit of God,
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.300]   aka you're a Christian, it's not that the Spirit of God
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.020]   is like, you know what, it's fine, keep gossiping.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.020]   It's that if you participate in gossip,
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.720]   you have silenced and silenced and ignored
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.000]   the Holy Spirit so many times, you're immune to it.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.060]   It doesn't even feel like a bad thing.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.840]   And it's a tragedy.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.840]   And it will rip apart relationships,
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.680]   it will poison the way that you see
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.560]   the people around you unfairly.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.880]   And it could even poison your relationship with the church,
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.980]   maybe even with God.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.840]   It'll corrupt your character.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   Gossip, here's what's crazy.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.820]   Gossip is satanic in the truest sense.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.380]   I know that sounds like really, man,
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.140]   it feels like you're really hammering this.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.760]   The first example we have of gossip in the Bible
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.620]   comes from Satan.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.900]   It happens in the very first time.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.660]   In other words, the very first time we're given somebody
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.780]   who talks negatively about someone
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.420]   who's not in the conversation
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.380]   is between Satan and Adam and Eve.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.980]   That, in other words, Satan says, hey, Adam and Eve,
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.380]   you know God, he really doesn't want great things for you,
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.420]   he really doesn't care, he just is trying to rip you off
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.860]   and he talks negatively about someone
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.320]   who's not a part of the conversation.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.640]   It is satanic in the truest sense.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.400]   That's why God hates it.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.160]   Paul in Titus 3, if you have a Bible,
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.640]   you can go read it later, but Paul says,
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.360]   man, if there's somebody who's creating division,
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.040]   if there's somebody who's introducing gossip
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.860]   into the church, three strike rule, warn 'em once,
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.120]   if they don't listen, warn 'em twice,
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.400]   if they don't listen, then kick 'em out.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.880]   It's like one of the few things where you're like,
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.640]   Paul, take it easy, come on.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.920]   It's just a, you know, through the grapevine talk.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.540]   And he said, it's a big deal.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.560]   And they need to be removed.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.800]   If they don't remove the gossip from inside of their hearts,
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.880]   gossip is what put Jesus on the cross.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.060]   Because the Jewish leaders at the time
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.720]   gossiped about him to the Roman rulers
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.500]   in order that they would have him crucified.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.200]   It is a big deal.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.960]   And so if the reasons for gossip are bad,
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.480]   the results are just destructive in your life
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.340]   and in my life, how do we remove it?
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.180]   How do we remove it?
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.000]   So let's talk about the removal of gossip
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.240]   from both individually and from the church.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.000]   What's the remedy that we can have?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:28.840]   And just to give you the headline,
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.560]   the remedy's gonna involve these four steps
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.620]   that are all about restraint, all about restraint.
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.360]   The good news is God's word makes it really, really clear
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.280]   what it looks like to restrain your tongue
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.660]   or when and who to talk to about which different things.
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.960]   So what is the removal of gossip look like?
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.800]   The first thing the Bible says is that you and I
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.840]   are to talk to people and not about people,
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.560]   talk to people and not about people.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.700]   Ephesians 4 verse 28 and 29 says this,
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.460]   do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouth.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.580]   What does unwholesome mean?
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.780]   But only what is helpful, only talk about things
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.020]   that are helpful for building other people up
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.380]   according to their needs, that you and I
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.780]   are to talk directly to people, not talk about them
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.660]   for the purpose of building them up and encouraging them,
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.740]   not speaking negatively about someone behind their back.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.260]   Some of you, the best, you can just leave here
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.660]   with one resolution, I'm not gonna say anything negative
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.220]   about people behind their back.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.180]   I mean, dude, you will be like,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.120]   light your workplace on fire, you will be the rising star
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.200]   where everyone's like, there's something different about her,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.440]   there's something different about him.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.960]   I just don't say things, I don't say negative things
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.880]   about people behind their back.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.480]   And I don't wanna hear negative things about them.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.880]   We only as Christians, we talk to people,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.580]   not about people for the purpose
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.960]   of being constructive and helping them.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:45.080]   I think as a person in, I mean, it's not even just church,
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.160]   I think in general, but maybe in any sort of leadership,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.540]   this can be a big struggle.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.180]   And here's where I was thinking through it in my own life,
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.600]   this can be a challenge for me,
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.780]   is I can find myself doing what I would call
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.440]   like a compliment sandwich, where I would say things like,
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.880]   I would feel the freedom to be like,
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.600]   hey, look, I love Garrett, okay?
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.640]   Garrett's our Fort Worth guy, I love Garrett, I'm a big fan.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.760]   But you know, he's a little intense, okay?
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.920]   That guy needs to just like take a break
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.240]   every once in a while and relax, man, it's okay,
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.400]   the tomb is empty.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.720]   And I can find myself feeling like I'm kinda justified
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.480]   in telling you that with him not there,
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.440]   'cause I'm just kinda saying my perception,
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.080]   I'm saying positive things and negative things,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.840]   and it's not okay.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.280]   And it poisoned your perspective.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.320]   Now on Garrett, you're like, that guy, man,
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.540]   take it easy, Garrett, am I right?
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.440]   Gosh, man, loosen up.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.120]   And it's not okay.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.160]   And Garrett is, Garrett, I'm sure you're relaxed right now,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.680]   none of this stuff is true, don't hold onto it,
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.960]   I poisoned their perspective.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.440]   Okay, so for me, that's what that looks like.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.240]   But regardless, any time that we talk to people
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.000]   and talk about people and not talk to people,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.200]   we are in sin, we're stepping into gossip.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.400]   The second quality is that we only talk to people,
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.040]   if you're a Christian, it means that to not gossip,
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.560]   to remove gossip from your life,
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.720]   you don't talk, I will not talk about you negatively
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.560]   behind your back.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.440]   Not only that, I will not talk to anyone
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.060]   about this situation who's not a part of the problem,
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.960]   they weren't a part of whatever conflict was created,
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.160]   whatever tension, whatever, the challenge
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   that we're facing, a part of the problem
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.360]   or a part of the solution.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.840]   I'm not gonna talk to anyone who's not a part
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.900]   of the problem or a part of the solution.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.600]   Jesus said this in Matthew chapter 18, verses 15,
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.160]   he lays out one of the clearest ways that you and I,
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.240]   if we're going to deal with one another
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.640]   and help one another grow in our faith
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.240]   and experience the benefits that come
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.080]   from Christian community and accountability,
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.280]   he gives us path towards that.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.280]   Here's what he says.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.240]   If your brother or sister sins,
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:41.720]   go and point out their fault just between the two of you.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.920]   So if you see someone caught in sin,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.740]   hey, I saw them staying in this hotel,
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.800]   I thought you were drunk at that bar,
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.340]   you know, it looked like you were dancing in a crazy way,
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.460]   I just feel like I need, for whatever reason,
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.140]   I feel like I need to share something with you.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.660]   Jesus says you go one on one.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.060]   You go just to that person.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.220]   And then if they don't listen there,
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.960]   or he says this, if they have listened,
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   you've won them over, which is the whole purpose.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.300]   The reason why we go and we point out things
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.900]   is not to rub their face in where they're not doing
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.180]   like perfect, the reason we go is so that they
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.160]   would experience growth in Jesus.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.240]   Hey, I wanna see, I wanna be God's man
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.260]   and point something out you may not know about.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.580]   Is this true?
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.400]   And he says if they listen, you've won them over.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.320]   But if they don't listen, take one or two others along
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.220]   so that every matter may be established
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.900]   by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.740]   What does that mean?
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.160]   He basically says, look, widen the circle.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.480]   Bring another believer along and say,
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.480]   hey, look, I sat down with Garrett
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.500]   and I gave him this advice, maybe I'm off here.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.360]   And so what do you think?
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.960]   JP, this is what I shared with him.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.080]   Here's what the situation is.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.840]   And I bring somebody else that is involved
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.220]   in the conversation and we work through that together.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.380]   And if they're still unrepentant and they're like,
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.120]   I'm just gonna do this, I don't care,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.880]   and it's a sin issue, then we bring it to the church.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.020]   We widen the circle again.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.760]   Jesus says you only talk to people who are a part
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.680]   of the problem or a part of the solution.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.400]   So then we widen it and in this context
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.020]   it'd be looping in their small group.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.720]   The church in this time was much smaller than everybody.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.400]   Hey, let me put up a slideshow.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.560]   This is Garrett and he's got some issues, all right?
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.520]   So everyone needs to know, and it wasn't that.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.000]   It was a small group of people.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.840]   Get 'em all together.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.000]   Hey, here's what we're processing and working through
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.160]   and I want you guys to know,
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.040]   here's what we're coming together.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.280]   And if he refuses to listen, even to the church,
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.400]   Jesus says, you should treat them as a pagan
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.400]   or a tax collector.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.680]   That if they refuse to be held accountable,
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.720]   then don't hold 'em accountable.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.240]   How did Jesus treat pagans and tax collectors?
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.080]   He loved 'em.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.520]   This isn't saying like you need to be mean
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.200]   and exclude them from your life.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.880]   It's saying you need to treat them and love them,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.680]   but don't seek to hold them accountable
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.600]   in the same way that you're to hold your brothers
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   in Christ and sisters in Christ accountable.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.420]   That's the step.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.240]   We only talk to people who are a part of the problem
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.080]   or a part of the solution.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.240]   Here's what this means.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.080]   If you come and you tell me gossip,
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.760]   you just made me a part of the problem
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.800]   and a part of the solution.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.860]   Now by nature of like, man, ah, you just told me that,
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.720]   now I have to go and declare I know that information now.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.720]   I have to go say, hey, with you, JP, or with Garrett,
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.640]   so in this situation, let's say Steve comes
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.560]   and tells me something about Garrett.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.240]   Sorry, buddy, I'm wearing you out.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.280]   Something about Garrett.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.000]   And I'm like, great, now I'm a part of the problem
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.600]   and the solution because he looped me in,
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.660]   so now I have to make sure he knows.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.800]   Garrett, here's what I heard from him.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.040]   And I make sure that you know,
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.960]   if you're gonna tell me that, I gotta declare it.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.340]   Like we're all for the unity of the spirit
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.920]   and keeping the bond of peace, Ephesians chapter four
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.520]   tells us, and so if you're gonna give me information
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.640]   that's negative about him, I'm gonna have to just declare
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.120]   it to everybody so we can drag it into the light,
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.840]   and you just made me a part of the problem
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.840]   and a part of the solution.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.760]   We only talk to people who are a part of the problem
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.760]   and a part of the solution.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.300]   Think about how different your perception of church
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.400]   would be if people did this.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.320]   Like how healthy that would be.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.640]   I don't ever have to wonder, did they talk about me
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.480]   behind my back?
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.240]   I know that if they did, they would come tell me,
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.120]   here's what we talked about, you behind your back.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.240]   Will you please forgive me?
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.440]   I mean, if any place on the planet should be one
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.160]   that feels just safe, and I don't have to go around
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.760]   with suspicion, it should be God's people.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.760]   Which leads us to the fourth thing.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.160]   Whenever we mess up, we ask for forgiveness.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.440]   The fourth thing about removing gossip from your life,
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.080]   and so the third thing is that we remove,
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.760]   or we ask for forgiveness quickly when we fall short.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.080]   We ask for forgiveness quickly.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.080]   If I step into gossip, intentionally or unintentionally
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.040]   or unaware, and someone points it out and helps me see that,
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.320]   I ask for forgiveness from the person I gossiped about.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.000]   Hey, I shouldn't have said this about you.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.520]   I said this without coming to you first.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.160]   Will you please forgive me?
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.520]   And I ask forgiveness for the person
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.560]   that I poisoned their perspective.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.880]   I just shot delicious but terrible things for them
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.680]   into their heart as it relates to another person.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.360]   How wicked and disgusting is that?
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.120]   And so I ask for forgiveness for that,
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.160]   and I bring everyone together as best I can and say,
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.200]   hey, will you please forgive me for sharing that about him?
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   That was not right.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.040]   Will you please forgive me?
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.400]   Here's what I shared, and it was not right,
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.840]   and I should have come to you first.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.120]   We ask for forgiveness, we own it quickly.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.540]   Fourth thing, man, this is so huge,
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.280]   is that as it relates to gossip,
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.600]   we do not tolerate hearing it.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.280]   We do not tolerate hearing it.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.120]   In other words, you can't be passive.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.760]   In other words, if everybody leaves here and is like,
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.040]   great, I just won't talk about it myself,
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.260]   that's not hitting the bullseye biblically,
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.300]   that you and I are called to not tolerate it.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.280]   I won't allow you to inject delicious morsels
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.120]   in front of me.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.680]   You bring those things around, I'm not taking 'em.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.120]   Get 'em outta here.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.360]   You and I can't, because whatever we permit,
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.960]   we're essentially promoting.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.560]   If I'm like, yeah, it's fine, you told me,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.400]   and I'm okay with that.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.680]   If we don't have the posture of,
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.000]   I'm not going to tolerate it.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.560]   Here's what Proverbs chapter 17, verse four says.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.280]   Wrongdoers listen to gossip.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.440]   Wrongdoers eagerly listen to gossip.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.520]   Liars pay close attention to slander.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.560]   That you cannot biblically live in line with God's way
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.760]   and tolerate gossip.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.920]   And so we've gotta be people who,
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.760]   if you bring information to me
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.460]   that is talking negative about someone who's not here,
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.480]   I'm gonna stop it, I'm gonna shut it down.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.500]   This changed my perspective of the church
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.540]   when I came here 90 years ago.
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.560]   For all the faults that Watermark has,
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.860]   one of the things that I think
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.000]   this place does exceptionally well,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.740]   better than any place I've ever seen,
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:44.740]   is the leadership is fanatic about killing gossip,
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.720]   for sure at a staff level,
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.520]   and hopefully as far down as it can reach.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.080]   I remember showing up nine years ago on staff,
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.520]   and there was this thing I was introduced called,
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.000]   "Hey, on staff, we have a 24-hour rule."
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.920]   24 hours, what's the 24-hour rule?
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.020]   The 24-hour rule is if you hear,
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.080]   or if someone says something,
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.040]   if someone gossips about someone,
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.160]   someone shares something negative
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.320]   about them behind their back,
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.040]   they have 24 hours to contact that person
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.920]   and let them know it was shared.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.740]   Here's what this looks like specifically.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.760]   I remember sitting there and someone sharing in my presence,
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.880]   "Hey, this is what Kyle's like,
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.980]   "and I just don't know that he really cares that much,
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.820]   "and he's all in."
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.920]   And honestly, he's been a little bit short.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.760]   Pause, "Hey, have you shared this with Kyle?"
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   "No, I haven't yet.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.100]   "I'm not even sure it would make a big difference."
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:31.940]   "Okay, great.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:36.600]   "Okay, I know that he, Kyle, would love to know that.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.760]   "He wants to follow Jesus.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.880]   "He wants to grow.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.120]   "He wants to be better, and so will you contact,
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.900]   "will you reach out and share that with him?"
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.120]   "Oh, man, I don't."
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.840]   In fact, in the next 24 hours,
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.560]   I want you to pick up the phone and call him
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.200]   and reach out and tell him that you told me this about him,
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.400]   and just share how, ask his forgiveness,
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.080]   and also share how you'd like to spur him on
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:35:59.920]   in that direction.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.860]   "I don't know if I can do that.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.280]   "That's so uncomfortable."
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.060]   "Okay, if you don't in 24 hours,
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.500]   "I'm gonna reach out to Kyle,
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.680]   "and I'm gonna tell him we had this conversation,
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.080]   "and I'm gonna let him know
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.220]   "that this was an area you identified,
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.780]   "but we all need to get together
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.120]   "so we can process through this to be diligent
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.580]   "to preserve the unity of the Spirit
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.420]   "and the bond of peace."
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.600]   Do you know what that did?
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.780]   Like, dude, this is so crazy.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.920]   It made gossip unsafe.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.060]   It made it so if you gossip,
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.840]   you are not comfortable on staff.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.340]   It made it so that people who like,
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.440]   you talk bad about someone,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.040]   like you bring those delicious morsels around,
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.800]   you're like, "Yeah, I'm gonna take these home."
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.240]   If you're baking these things,
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.840]   you are not comfortable on staff
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.020]   because you would be immediately rushed in on,
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.160]   "That is not okay."
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.280]   Because what happens whenever you have to sit down,
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.440]   you have to call Kyle and be like,
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.920]   "Kyle, yeah, I said that you don't really care
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.360]   "that much about God, and you're ugly."
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.280]   You're like, "That's uncomfortable.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.920]   "I think we can all agree there."
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.780]   And yet, it is the loving thing to do,
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.240]   to say, "I'm not gonna tolerate gossip.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.480]   "I'm not gonna tolerate you doing it,
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.020]   "and I have a role to play in it.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.840]   "Wrongdoers listen to gossip.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.040]   "And so if you're gonna bring that to me,
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.540]   "I have an obligation and a responsibility
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.260]   "as a follower of Jesus,
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.700]   "because the church is gonna get a bad reputation,
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.920]   "church has a bad reputation, as it relates to gossip.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.620]   "And so I'm gonna do anything and everything I can
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.480]   "to make sure that gossip is not safe
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.720]   "as far as it relates to me."
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.040]   The reasons that we gossip are not good.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.320]   I'm gonna land the plane.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.880]   The results of gossip, man, they're so toxic.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.120]   And tragically, one of the biggest results is it,
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.080]   it's a mockery to the world around us.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.560]   This is how important your God is?
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.360]   This is what Christianity really does to your life?
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.960]   Not that much?
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.220]   This is how important your relationships,
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.740]   your love for one another is?
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.380]   And the removing of gossip is possible,
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.360]   and there are steps that God has laid out
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.560]   inside of Scripture, where we talk to people,
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.460]   not about people.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.480]   We only talk to people who are part of the problem
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.800]   or part of the solution.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.600]   We ask forgiveness when we fall short,
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.440]   'cause that's gonna happen.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.120]   And we do not tolerate hearing gossip.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.560]   I will not tolerate hearing gossip.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.440]   I will not talk negatively about anyone
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.120]   that is not present.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.680]   And I will only talk in a way that's helpful
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.880]   for building someone up.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:24.840]   Jesus really gives us the ultimate example
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.800]   of what it looks like to use your words well.
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.900]   Like if anybody could have gossiped,
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.540]   it's gotta be the Son of God who knows everything
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.380]   that everyone has ever done ever, and even their thoughts.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.120]   I mean, truly, like you think about it,
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.300]   we have no record, Jesus never did,
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.700]   but if anybody could have, it'd be like,
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.380]   oh, you like Bob, really?
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:46.620]   Let me tell you about Bob, okay?
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.580]   Here's what Bob does when no one's watching.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.420]   I'm watching.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.260]   And he could have.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.380]   We don't have any record of that.
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.420]   What Jesus does with his tongue is entirely different.
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.200]   Anytime he's talking about someone who's not present,
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.340]   he doesn't use it to slander or to talk bad.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.840]   He uses it in a very different way.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.120]   Do you know that there's an occasion
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.300]   where God talks about you behind your back?
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.440]   There's a place in Scripture
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.320]   where he literally talks about, if you're a Christian,
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.760]   he talks about you.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.120]   And he says something very interesting
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.880]   as it relates to the topic at hand,
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.360]   as it relates to just the topic of gospel
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.020]   and how destructive and divisive it is
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.360]   and how it has no place in the church.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.520]   There's one place where Jesus says
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.020]   he talks about you behind your back.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.240]   It's in his last moments or really last hours
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.240]   that he has on the planet
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.480]   where he's about to be betrayed by Judas,
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.040]   and he has this thing called the high priestly prayer.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.320]   It's in John chapter 17.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.240]   And in it, he begins to pray a number of different things,
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.400]   but one of the things that he prays relates to you
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.680]   and is right on the topic of what we're talking about
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.600]   as it relates to gossip.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.800]   And here's what he says.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.300]   Jesus speaking and praying.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:02.020]   Father, I'm praying not only for these disciples, his 12,
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:08.020]   but also for anyone who will ever believe in me
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.820]   through their message.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.320]   If you're a Christian, this is, he prayed for you.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.800]   And here's what I pray,
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.520]   that they would all be united or be one,
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.420]   just as you and I are one,
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.980]   that the same unity the Trinity has,
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.520]   that they would have together in 2018, in 2019, 2014,
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.840]   that anyone who would ever believe in me
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.280]   would have this unity together, not be divided.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.260]   And as you were in me and the Father, I am in you,
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.420]   and that they may be in us together united
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:44.360]   so that the world will believe that you sent me.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.680]   This is why gossip is so dangerous,
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.080]   and it's so disgusting, and it's so tragic.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.200]   To a watching world, it's like,
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.400]   man, yeah, your God's a big deal.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.700]   You guys are dysfunctional.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.640]   And if anybody should be experts
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.520]   in the ability to handle relationships, maintain trust,
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.160]   it's gotta be the people of God.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.600]   I have given them the glory, verse 22,
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.660]   that you have given me
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.840]   so that they would be one as we are one.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.940]   And I am in them, and you are in me.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:16.000]   May they experience such perfect unity
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.680]   that the world will know that you sent me.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.160]   And that you love them as much as you love me.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.240]   I mean, Jesus.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.800]   Jesus, when it is last prayer,
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.400]   the last prayer he prays is,
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.000]   God, here's what I'm praying.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.200]   Father, for anyone who ever will believe the message
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.520]   that these 12 right here are gonna go out and spread,
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.200]   for anyone who will ever accept that message,
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.080]   if you're a Christian, that's you,
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.240]   I'm praying that they will be so united together
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.760]   that the body of Christ or the church
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.920]   or anyone who ever believes would have this unity
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.640]   that you can't explain in any other way
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.760]   other than it's divine.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.640]   That when it comes to their relationships,
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.720]   they don't see themselves as I gotta protect my back
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.880]   and no one else is looking for me.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.640]   They're going, I'm all about you, I care about you,
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.200]   we're gonna be united around Jesus, united around truth,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   and I'm not gonna allow any divisive language
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.160]   or any divisive talk to slip in here
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.080]   'cause I'm the body of Christ.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.520]   And here's what Jesus said is at stake.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.240]   If they do that, what happens, Jesus said.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.480]   When that happens, he says, the world looks and goes,
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.600]   yeah, Jesus is God.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.840]   There's something different about those guys.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.680]   The savior of the world is really Jesus.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.320]   It is Jesus who came into the world
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.400]   and that God is out there, he sent him.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.600]   That's what he prays, that the result
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.280]   of when the church is united in that way,
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.440]   when they're not divided,
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.400]   or they don't allow divisiveness to come in,
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.840]   is that the world looks and says,
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.040]   maybe he really is the son of God.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.400]   How important is removing gossip?
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.520]   Jesus says it's the hope of the church.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.100]   Gossip is the opposite of the gospel.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.940]   Gossip says, I'm good because he's bad.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.300]   I feel better because he's worse.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.900]   I'm strong because they're weak.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.500]   The gospel is, I'm weak, Jesus is strong, he's king,
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.580]   and I'm not gonna let anything come in the way of his people.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.860]   That's the message of Jesus,
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.540]   that's the message of the gospel.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.260]   Gossip flies in the face of even Jesus's message.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.660]   Jesus said on the cross, I will pay for anyone
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.160]   who would accept what I did in their place.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.600]   I'm dying for them for all of eternity.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.980]   I'm paying past, present, future, any sin,
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.800]   if anyone will accept, I'm dying in their place.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.320]   Put your faith, your trust in me,
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.200]   not in how good of a person you are.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.160]   And if you do that, I will not count your sins against you.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.440]   You will be counted as righteous.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.040]   Gossip, gossip among Christians is saying,
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.800]   those righteous people, I'm counting their sins
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.200]   against them.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.600]   It is satanic, it is unchristlike,
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.660]   and it has no place among the body of Christ in the church.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.520]   And anyone who gossips here, including me,
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:55.080]   has no action to take other than to repent,
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.900]   ask for forgiveness, cling to God's grace that he's offered,
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:03.520]   and to continue to not permit it,
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.600]   to not allow it when I hear it.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.440]   And I need you to do the same if you hear it from me.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.640]   And Jesus says, if you do that,
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.560]   you wanna know how powerful that is?
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.520]   Jesus, is it really that big of a deal?
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.300]   It's the hope of the world.
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.440]   Because when the church is united, people go,
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.480]   man, he is the son of God.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.880]   And he is the son of God.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.960]   Let me pray.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:35.820]   Father, would you help us?
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.800]   Sadly, for far too long,
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.520]   the church has been a place that has been filled
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.600]   with toxic conversations,
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.740]   people spreading lies and rumors and slander
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.380]   and disgusting things.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:59.660]   Father, would that end with our generation?
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:03.600]   And would we begin just a movement,
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.740]   even among God's people, inside of our own country,
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:06.800]   maybe just inside of our city,
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.560]   and maybe just inside of this room,
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.720]   where, you know what, we're not gonna take it,
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.040]   we're not gonna tolerate gossip,
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.280]   we're not gonna talk negatively about people.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.360]   And we're gonna showcase
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:23.060]   that there's something different about us because of Jesus.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.600]   We're gonna showcase our unity and oneness,
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.440]   and in doing so, we're gonna showcase
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.280]   you're the son of God, the savior of the world,
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.520]   the king.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:39.040]   For anyone who doesn't know you, Father,
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.640]   would tonight be the night that they see,
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.040]   despite maybe the failed representations
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.560]   of the church on oneness,
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.960]   that tonight they would see and accept, by faith,
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.720]   what you did for them on the cross.
