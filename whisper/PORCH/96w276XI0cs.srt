1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,160
 (gentle music)

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,120
 - Welcome, welcome.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,200
 Friends of the room here in Dallas.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,060
 Tonight we're gonna continue the Colossians series

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,900
 that we're in.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,720
 I'm gonna tell a story,

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,560
 they'll kinda tell us where we're going.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,040
 When I started dating my now wife,

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,200
 then just date,

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,880
 she was driving a very unique automobile.

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,080
 And it was this 1994 Toyota Camry

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,360
 that was like a piece of junk, totally.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,320
 It had hundreds of thousands of miles on it.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,200
 The windows wouldn't roll down.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,940
 And she lived in College Station, Texas,

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,660
 which is, whoop, very, it's very hot.

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,600
 And she didn't have a radio.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,480
 She couldn't open the driver's side door.

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,240
 So anytime that we would hang out together,

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,200
 she would open the door for me and her

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,440
 and then crawl over to get to her spot.

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,740
 So we didn't take her car very often.

24
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,040
 But it was just like this total clunker of a car.

25
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,160
 Every time that she would turn,

26
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,960
 her bumper was hanging from the front of the car

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,860
 on the left side.

28
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,880
 So when she would take left turns,

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,000
 it would like sparks,

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,280
 would fireworks show,

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,040
 would just go off from this car.

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,760
 And really, she grew up in kinda circumstances

33
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,120
 that that was, the only reason you drive that car

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,960
 is if you have to.

35
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,160
 And this was kinda her case.

36
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,400
 She drove it 'cause she had to.

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,280
 She was raised in a single, for the most part, mom family.

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,320
 And that was the car that she had.

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,640
 And so when I started dating her,

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
 this was kinda the case.

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,120
 So we would take my car most of the time,

42
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,380
 my little exterior lady car, sorority car,

43
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,720
 like we talked about a couple weeks ago.

44
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,320
 But there came a day where in the midst of this,

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,760
 in the midst of her driving this,

46
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,800
 her mom remarried.

47
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,160
 And he remarried a guy named Charlie.

48
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,280
 And Charlie was about to totally change

49
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,600
 a lot of things in their life.

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,520
 And one day, they went out to dinner as a family.

51
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,320
 And she went out and she was with him.

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,960
 And she walked outside after dinner,

53
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,160
 they left the restaurant.

54
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,520
 She comes outside and she sees this like brand new car

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
 with a bow on it.

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
 And she goes, "Oh my gosh, that's so cool.

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
 "It looks like a commercial.

58
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,440
 "Somebody's getting a car."

59
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,240
 And Charlie, sugar daddy, just goes,

60
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,880
 I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

61
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,800
 Charlie, if you have more of them,

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,920
 I don't know why I'm pointing up.

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,440
 So it's like, Charlie.

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,980
 Charlie said, "You're that person.

65
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,960
 "You're getting this car."

66
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,080
 And she's like so pumped.

67
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,000
 She's ecstatic.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,240
 Of course, all she's ever known is this car,

69
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,160
 Camry, she called Hank, which for some reason like fit.

70
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,200
 I'm sorry if your name's Hank in the room.

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,080
 But she's now stepping into a brand new car.

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,480
 She's calling me, she's like excited

73
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,800
 about the little things like the windows go down

74
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,320
 and there's air conditioner and there's a radio

75
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,600
 and all these things that she was so excited about.

76
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,320
 And her relationship with Charlie and him,

77
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,080
 this father presence in her life

78
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,740
 would change a lot more than the car.

79
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,600
 She was able to go to grad school.

80
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,480
 They were able to finally have a home.

81
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,480
 They kind of had house hopped and rented

82
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,680
 for years and years and years.

83
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,400
 And this new fatherly relationship totally changed

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,040
 and totally brought with it access

85
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,200
 to all kinds of things in her life.

86
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,800
 The reason I tell you that is because tonight

87
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,480
 we are continuing the book of Colossians

88
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,980
 where Paul in the end of the first chapter,

89
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,840
 so if you have your Bible, you can flip there,

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
 is gonna really lay out some of the things

91
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,720
 that our new relationship as Christians,

92
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,300
 we have been given access or given a new relationship

93
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,260
 through Jesus and trusting in Jesus' death alone for us,

94
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,000
 we now enter into a new relationship

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,740
 that brings with it access of all kinds of things.

96
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,560
 And Paul's gonna lay out really what those things are

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,800
 and how they impact our life.

98
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,160
 And I think what's so important about this message

99
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,160
 is that I think not knowing and not understanding

100
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,240
 what you and I have in Christ,

101
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,700
 what Christ has given us is responsible

102
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,700
 for so much of the defeated mentality, empty mentality,

103
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,640
 empty experience of life and really despair

104
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,700
 that many, even if they're Christians,

105
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,740
 experience in this life.

106
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,460
 And so Paul writes to lay out to these Colossians,

107
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,180
 no, you don't know how much you have,

108
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,060
 you don't know who you are

109
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,380
 and what Christ has given you through him.

110
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,140
 So if you have your Bible, you can open it up to Colossians.

111
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,420
 If you don't know where that is,

112
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,580
 the best way to get there is there's a table of contents

113
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,940
 in the front of the Bible, revolutionary.

114
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,980
 And if you flip open to that, you can go there

115
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,860
 'cause I know what it's like to be like, where, nay whom?

116
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,600
 I went to seminary and I don't know where that is.

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,180
 I'm just flipping, don't judge me.

118
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,640
 And so go to the front and find Colossians.

119
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,760
 We're gonna be in the first chapter.

120
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,900
 If you missed the last two weeks,

121
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,180
 highly encourage you to go check out those messages.

122
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,340
 They're all on the porch app

123
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,620
 or you can find them online at theporchdalas.com.

124
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,980
 We're gonna pick it up in verse 24

125
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,660
 as we continue Paul's letter

126
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,260
 to this group of new believers in Christ

127
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,220
 who are mainly Gentile or non-Jewish

128
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,660
 who are trying to figure out how to live

129
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,980
 this new Christian life when the New Testament was new

130
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,500
 and trying to explore what that looks like.

131
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,300
 So Paul writes to give them clarity on this.

132
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,980
 We're gonna really kind of get a running start

133
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,020
 through the first four verses

134
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,340
 and then pick up our first point there.

135
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,180
 So here we go, we're gonna be in verse 24, chapter one.

136
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,220
 Paul speaking, "Now I rejoice

137
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,420
 "in what I am suffering for you.

138
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,860
 "And I fill up in my flesh what is lacking

139
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,040
 "in regard to Christ's afflictions,

140
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,180
 "for the sake of his body, which is the church."

141
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,420
 Now Paul basically starts and he says,

142
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,520
 "Look, I rejoice or I take joy in suffering

143
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
 "to get the message of Jesus, to fulfill,

144
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
 "extending and delivering the message of Jesus

145
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,620
 "to all people who don't have it."

146
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,300
 That's bizarre, specifically the point where he says,

147
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,780
 "Look, I rejoice in suffering."

148
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,860
 And if you don't think it's bizarre,

149
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,860
 it's because you've been desensitized to it.

150
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,760
 Who rejoices?

151
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,580
 What kind of like glutton for punishment are we here, Paul?

152
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,780
 Where you're like, "Hey, punch me in the arm,

153
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,140
 "punch me in the arm, punch me in the face,

154
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,420
 "punch me in the face."

155
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,620
 Where Paul is going, "Look, I rejoice to suffer."

156
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,860
 But there's something, it's not like Paul is a superhuman,

157
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,760
 there's something behind why in the midst of suffering

158
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,440
 to get the message out, which he's sitting

159
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,940
 in a Roman prison, he can still take joy

160
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,060
 and he's about to tell us what that is in his life.

161
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,840
 Verse 25, "I have become its servant

162
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,080
 "by the commission God gave me, servant of the church,

163
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,560
 "to present to you the word of God in its fullness."

164
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,160
 That word of God, the Old Testament,

165
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,560
 "That I've become the servant of the church

166
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,820
 "to present to you what God has been doing

167
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,980
 "since the beginning, what everything's pointed to."

168
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,820
 Verse 26, "The mystery," he says,

169
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,220
 "that has been kept hidden for ages and generations,

170
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,080
 "but is now disclosed to the Lord's people.

171
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,440
 "To them," so he's gonna tell us what this mystery,

172
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,540
 so I'm here to tell what the mystery is.

173
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,680
 "To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles

174
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,600
 "the glorious riches of this mystery."

175
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,920
 So lots of buildup, here's the mystery.

176
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,480
 "Christ in you, Gentiles."

177
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,080
 In other words, for generations past and generations past,

178
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,060
 the idea that God was a God who really wanted all people

179
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,720
 to be a part of his chosen people,

180
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,520
 and not just the Jews, was a mystery.

181
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,240
 In other words, Paul says, the mystery is that Christ

182
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,000
 or God loves everybody.

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,340
 Christ will accept anybody.

184
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,140
 The door is wide open, regardless of your color of skin,

185
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,860
 regardless of the things that you've done,

186
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,180
 regardless of who you are or who you think you are.

187
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,460
 Paul says the mystery is that God is for everybody.

188
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,620
 And again, we read that,

189
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,620
 and it's not really mysterious to us.

190
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,580
 It would be like me saying, hey, let me tell you a mystery.

191
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,560
 The earth is not flat.

192
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,100
 It's round, and if you go to the very edges of it,

193
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,220
 you will not fall off.

194
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,480
 But to them, this would have been a mystery,

195
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,920
 that this was something that they didn't know.

196
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,720
 To us, we're like, yeah, I've known that for a long time.

197
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,520
 But to them, for the longest time,

198
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,840
 all of the Jewish people, or many of them,

199
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,660
 a mystery that Noah, Moses, all of them,

200
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,840
 for generations past, did not fully know.

201
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,000
 They thought they were uniquely chosen by God,

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,760
 that if you said, two, four, six, eight,

203
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,600
 who does God appreciate?

204
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,600
 The Jews, the Jews, and that would be how they thought.

205
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,980
 And so Paul says, no, this has been a mystery

206
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,320
 that they didn't know for centuries past,

207
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,260
 that there's been something done in our midst,

208
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,820
 and it is this, that God cares and loves

209
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,700
 of every person who's ever existed.

210
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,100
 He wants everyone to know them.

211
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,260
 This is the mystery.

212
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,340
 And then he gives us our first point,

213
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,140
 that Christ in everybody, or Christ in you,

214
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,320
 and he says, Christ in you gives you this, first point.

215
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,320
 Christ gives us the hope of glory,

216
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,940
 that anyone in the room,

217
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,180
 and I just want you to think about this.

218
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,380
 You've been a Christian for a long time.

219
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,520
 If you have Jesus, regardless of what you've done today,

220
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,000
 or yesterday, or emotionally, where you feel,

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,400
 if you have trusted in Jesus Christ,

222
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,840
 and his death on the cross, and resurrection,

223
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,120
 Paul says, you have the hope of glory

224
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,800
 through Christ in you right now.

225
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,880
 Speaking of eternity, you have hope in the midst,

226
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,320
 and hope is so powerful.

227
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,680
 And he says, your hope is not just some aimless hope,

228
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,400
 it is the hope of one day, there's gonna come a day,

229
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,640
 like Isaac said in that spoken word,

230
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,400
 where God restores everything, he makes everything right.

231
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,620
 That in essence, I mean, the power of hope,

232
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,860
 is that it allows us to endure,

233
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,260
 no matter what the circumstances are.

234
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,920
 It strengthens our patience, or increases our patience.

235
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,880
 Because here's the deal, you and I, spoiler alert,

236
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,940
 we know who wins.

237
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,940
 We know how this thing ends in the end.

238
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,520
 That in the end, there's gonna come a day,

239
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,920
 where everything's made right, and Jesus wins.

240
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,880
 Jesus wins over death, Jesus wins over sin,

241
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,120
 Jesus wins over seizures, Jesus wins over cancer,

242
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,920
 that everything will be made right.

243
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,440
 You will finally be home if you have Christ.

244
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,800
 You'll never stand next to the deathbed of a loved one,

245
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,520
 you'll never attend another funeral,

246
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,000
 you'll never battle against sin in your own life.

247
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,040
 Racism will not exist, hatred will not exist.

248
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,960
 Jesus wins, and there's gonna come a day,

249
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,660
 you're gonna see him, if you know him.

250
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,040
 And you're gonna stand before him,

251
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,640
 and you're gonna look into his eyes that are like fire,

252
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,360
 the scripture says, you're gonna see

253
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,380
 the nail prints in his hands,

254
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,680
 and he's gonna say, welcome home.

255
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,640
 You're finally home, and the war will be over.

256
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,200
 That we have this hope, Paul says.

257
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,860
 If you have Christ, that's where your hope is.

258
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,840
 Hope is powerful, because it allows us to endure singleness,

259
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,920
 heartbreak, shame, whatever we're feeling,

260
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,400
 it allows us to continue to endure.

261
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,820
 Because we have hope.

262
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,640
 Hope fulfilled in Jesus.

263
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,700
 He continues.

264
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,200
 And he really tells us how Christ in him

265
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,480
 gives him not just the hope of glory,

266
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,320
 but it does something else.

267
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,360
 Here's what he says.

268
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,360
 He, verse 28, Jesus, he is the one that we proclaim,

269
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,680
 admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom

270
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,580
 so that we may present everyone fully mature,

271
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,880
 you may have fully complete in Christ.

272
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,720
 To this end, I strenuously contend

273
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,920
 with all the energy Christ so powerfully works inside of me.

274
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,200
 Who does Paul say is the one,

275
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,940
 the focal point that we proclaim?

276
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,800
 It is a pretty easy answer.

277
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,640
 Any idea?

278
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,460
 Nope.

279
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,280
 Jesus.

280
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,960
 And it's church, safe answer.

281
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,400
 Jesus is the one.

282
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,240
 I mean, think about this.

283
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,480
 So here's what Paul just said.

284
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,360
 He just said, look, Jesus is the point.

285
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,400
 Jesus is the message.

286
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,600
 Jesus is the means by which, or is the focal point,

287
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,640
 the starting point to everyone that we proclaim.

288
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,880
 Jesus, who do we go to?

289
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,600
 What is first on God's agenda for humanity?

290
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,800
 Accepting Jesus.

291
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,520
 I mean, the church has like historically

292
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,420
 been so, done such a bad job at times

293
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,120
 of doing this right here.

294
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,920
 Like the biggest thing God's concerned with

295
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,200
 for your non-Christian coworker

296
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,600
 who's sleeping with their boyfriend,

297
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,840
 or your friend who's gay, or can't stop smoking pot

298
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,960
 is not stopping smoking pot or their sexuality.

299
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,500
 Jesus is.

300
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,040
 Jesus is the message.

301
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,240
 Jesus is who we proclaim.

302
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,720
 Paul says the starting point for every person

303
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,160
 is proclaiming the message of Jesus.

304
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,140
 Our job is to point to him.

305
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,420
 Jesus.

306
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,580
 Because what keeps someone out of a relationship with God,

307
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,080
 or out of heaven, is not their sexuality,

308
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,480
 it's not an addiction,

309
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,920
 it's not accepting Jesus.

310
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,080
 And he says that's the starting point.

311
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,880
 That's who we push people to.

312
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,760
 That's when we engage with people.

313
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
 Do you know who Jesus is?

314
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,200
 And here's why I think this is so huge for us

315
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,560
 as we talk and have conversations with non-believing friends

316
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,040
 or maybe if you're in the room and you're like,

317
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,560
 I'm still figuring this faith thing out.

318
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,800
 Here's what I think you would know if you knew Jesus,

319
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,640
 if you could see him as who he is,

320
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,200
 as who the Bible presents, you would like him.

321
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,720
 Your non-Christian friends would like him.

322
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,040
 There's parts of Jesus that are honestly

323
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
 pretty irresistible.

324
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,320
 Like who doesn't wanna have rest?

325
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,040
 Who doesn't wanna find rest for their soul?

326
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,000
 Jesus says if you're tired and worn out and burned out,

327
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,860
 come to me.

328
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,440
 How can you resist that?

329
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,960
 Who doesn't wanna have freedom from guilt and shame?

330
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,340
 Or who likes to carry around guilt and shame?

331
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,160
 And Jesus says, I came to deal with that.

332
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,360
 I mean, even like the compassion of Jesus,

333
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,320
 it's like, it's hard not to be drawn to him.

334
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,000
 This week we're celebrating Easter

335
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,280
 and all over the world, billions of people

336
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,960
 will gather together and they're gonna focus

337
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,520
 on the death and resurrection of Jesus.

338
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,280
 And even in the cross, we see this like crazy compassion

339
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,840
 of Jesus where Luke tells us in the 23rd chapter,

340
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,680
 Jesus is on the cross.

341
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,280
 He's been nailed into wood behind his hands

342
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,480
 and he looks down and his compassion is even there

343
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,040
 where he says, Father, forgive them

344
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,160
 for they know not what they are doing.

345
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
 Speaking of as he looks down at these Roman soldiers

346
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,520
 and it's like, I think they knew what they were doing.

347
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,680
 They've done this a lot of times.

348
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,040
 I think they know exactly.

349
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,920
 He says, look God, when it comes for them

350
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,600
 to give an account for everything they've ever done in life,

351
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,760
 would you not hold this against them?

352
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,720
 Would you not hold this that they crucified your son,

353
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
 that they crucified Jesus?

354
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,040
 I mean, even the generosity of Jesus is like really hard

355
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,000
 not to be drawn to.

356
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
 Generous people in general are like,

357
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
 you just like to be around him.

358
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,680
 It's hard to not like someone who's generous.

359
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,520
 Have you noticed this?

360
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,640
 Like you just kinda, if they're generous with their time

361
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,600
 or their money, they're like, yeah, let me serve you.

362
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,920
 Or they're like, hey, I got dinner.

363
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,800
 It's like, I'd like to hang out with you some more.

364
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
 We got a dinner tomorrow and the next day.

365
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,560
 It's just hard not to be,

366
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,640
 or not to like someone who's generous.

367
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,040
 And I mean, another portrait you'll probably hear

368
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,880
 this weekend of just Jesus on the cross

369
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,760
 and how insanely generous he is.

370
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,960
 That I'm here to pay for everyone's sin.

371
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,400
 Anyone who wants the free gift, I've paid for it.

372
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,720
 They can have that.

373
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,160
 Regardless of what they do,

374
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,600
 regardless of what they've ever done.

375
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
 I mean, on the cross, he's sitting there

376
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,560
 and there's a thief behind him or beside him.

377
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,560
 Who asked Jesus for a favor.

378
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,480
 In his dying breaths, he looks over and says,

379
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,400
 Jesus, I haven't really lived a good life.

380
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,160
 I'm here for stealing or murdering.

381
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
 And I'd like to ask you a favor.

382
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,920
 Will you remember me when you come into your paradise?

383
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,200
 And Jesus doesn't look at him and go, nice try.

384
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,080
 After living your entire life away from me,

385
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,520
 you think I'm gonna let you in?

386
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,360
 That's funny.

387
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,200
 Nice try, buddy.

388
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,440
 He doesn't say that at all.

389
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,000
 I mean, what could the guy even offer?

390
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,160
 In his life.

391
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,400
 I promise Jesus, I'll never do it again.

392
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,160
 From this point on, I'm so sincere.

393
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,720
 I mean, nothing.

394
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,320
 And Jesus looks at him and he says,

395
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,760
 today, you'll be with me in paradise.

396
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,040
 I mean, there's a level with Jesus,

397
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,120
 it's pretty irresistible.

398
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,800
 So we as the church, we just get out of the way

399
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,280
 and we point them to Jesus.

400
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,880
 Do you know this Jesus?

401
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,000
 Do you know this God who loved you enough

402
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,080
 to give his life for you?

403
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,480
 Who changed the calendar?

404
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,760
 Who changed the world?

405
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,320
 What do you think about him?

406
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,040
 And Paul says, he's the starting point.

407
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,520
 He's the one we proclaim.

408
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,280
 And he really says, who is this to?

409
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,080
 He says, everyone, three times.

410
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,000
 Admonishing everyone.

411
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,400
 If you have the NIV, they removed one of the everyone's.

412
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,160
 Not sure why, but they did.

413
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,800
 Admonishing everyone, teaching everyone

414
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,640
 that we may present everyone, every person,

415
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,760
 red, yellow, black, and white, rich or poor.

416
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,160
 We admonish, we tell everyone about Jesus.

417
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,680
 Jim Elliot said that as the church,

418
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,680
 we are a bunch of nobodies telling everybody

419
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,040
 about somebody who can save anybody.

420
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,880
 I love that.

421
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,320
 We are a bunch of nobodies telling everybody

422
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,720
 about the only one who's a somebody

423
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,680
 who can save anybody or anyone.

424
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,960
 Paul answers also how he did this.

425
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,600
 Like, what moved you, Paul?

426
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,520
 Paul's sitting there and he's saying,

427
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,960
 this is what drives my life.

428
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,520
 I tell everyone about Jesus.

429
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,080
 I wanna proclaim Jesus first and foremost,

430
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,080
 and Christ powerfully works within me to do this.

431
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,200
 But like, what was behind Jesus sharing?

432
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,720
 I mean, Paul sharing Jesus with everyone he encountered.

433
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,440
 Christ, inside of him.

434
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,200
 100 years ago, 101, I believe, actually,

435
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,120
 in two weeks, there was an event that took place

436
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,200
 that really shook the world,

437
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
 and it was the sinking of the Titanic.

438
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,200
 And on the Titanic, which I'm sure everyone knows about,

439
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,480
 saw the movie, and on that boat,

440
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,760
 there was a man who got on there,

441
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,040
 and his name was John Harper.

442
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,520
 And he was a famous pastor from the UK,

443
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,520
 and he was going to speak at a guy named D.L. Moody,

444
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,360
 who's in Chicago.

445
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,960
 He was going to speak at a church in Chicago.

446
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,280
 And he was getting on a boat to get over there.

447
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,840
 And he got on with his six-year-old daughter,

448
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,160
 and he had lost his wife, actually,

449
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,400
 in delivering their child.

450
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,240
 He was a widow.

451
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,760
 And he and his six-year-old daughter get on the boat,

452
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,960
 and they're going over on the Titanic.

453
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,600
 And then on April 14th, around midnight,

454
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
 as we know, they hit an iceberg,

455
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,880
 and the ship began to go down.

456
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,760
 And people who survived say that John Harper

457
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
 ran all over the deck saying,

458
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,360
 "Women and children, and those who don't know Jesus,

459
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,440
 "on the lifeboats."

460
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,920
 And then he took his six-year-old girl, and he took her,

461
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,160
 and they had a spot in the lifeboat, for both of them,

462
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
 because he's a famous pastor, he's a widow,

463
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,000
 and so both of them had a spot.

464
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And he kisses his six-year-old girl,

465
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,880
 and says, "I've gotta go, but I'll see you again someday."

466
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,920
 And he leaves her, and he voluntarily,

467
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,000
 at a time when people are trying to buy their way

468
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,240
 onto a lifeboat, he gets off of the lifeboat,

469
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,000
 and he goes back and continues telling people about Jesus.

470
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,920
 And then as the boat goes down, he jumps into the water

471
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,960
 and begins swimming with his life jacket on

472
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,880
 from person to person, saying, "Do you know Jesus?

473
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,000
 "Are you saved?"

474
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,400
 And then he would explain the gospel if they didn't.

475
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,200
 And he came up to one man who said,

476
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,920
 "No, I don't, and I don't want to."

477
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,440
 And he's holding onto a piece of wood,

478
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,520
 and John Harper says, "Take my life jacket,

479
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,920
 "because you're gonna need this more than I do."

480
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,560
 And he gives him his life jacket, and he swims off,

481
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,720
 he continues to tell people.

482
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,400
 And then at one point, the waves brought him back

483
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,200
 to this man he'd given his life jacket,

484
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
 and he said, "Are you saved?

485
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,720
 "Do you know Jesus?

486
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,200
 "Have you trusted him?"

487
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,000
 And he says, "I haven't, but I want to."

488
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,560
 And he led him to Christ, and then John sank, and he died.

489
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,200
 There were six people that were rescued

490
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,080
 from the 1500 in the water, and one of them was this man.

491
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,760
 And he stood up three years later

492
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,280
 at a survivor's meeting in Canada,

493
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,700
 and they all shared their stories, and he said,

494
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,040
 "I am the last convert of John Harper.

495
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,140
 "I was saved twice that night,

496
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,960
 "once for eternity, and once for this life,

497
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,060
 "all because of a man who could've taken an easy way out,

498
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,660
 "but said, 'Everyone lives forever somewhere.

499
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,200
 "'How can I not go in?'"

500
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,540
 They've got bigger issues

501
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,320
 than just how much life they have left here.

502
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,280
 They've got eternal life awaiting them.

503
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,320
 And the reason I think that's powerful to me

504
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,600
 is I just was praying and thinking on this week

505
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,840
 in light of this passage,

506
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,380
 it's like, what was the driving force behind John Harper?

507
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,040
 I mean, it's the same driving force behind Paul,

508
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,160
 that it wasn't just John's a really great guy,

509
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,280
 loves the water, it wasn't that at all.

510
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,120
 I feel like that's not a good joke.

511
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,080
 Moving on, it wasn't that at all.

512
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,240
 It was Jesus, like, you know who loved those people

513
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,300
 more than John?

514
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,280
 Jesus.

515
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,740
 Enough to move inside of one of his servants and say,

516
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,780
 "Go tell 'em, go tell 'em you're gonna be with me forever.

517
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,640
 "Go tell 'em they can be with me forever."

518
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,240
 Like, he didn't jump in the water, 'cause he was like,

519
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,640
 "Maybe I'll get into heaven then."

520
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,120
 He jumped in the water to get others to heaven.

521
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,040
 And the same thing is true with Paul.

522
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,560
 Who loved those Colossians more than Paul?

523
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,500
 Jesus.

524
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,480
 And he wants to take your life and my life

525
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,200
 and powerfully work through it to proclaim him,

526
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,400
 to proclaim hope, to proclaim eternal life

527
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,560
 and abundant life in this one for anyone who will let him.

528
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,240
 He then gives us really even more insight, Paul does,

529
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,160
 into how Christ works inside of him,

530
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,720
 of how Christ gives him the ability to live this new life.

531
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,060
 He picks it up in verse one of chapter two.

532
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,160
 I want you to know how hard, Paul's speaking,

533
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,760
 I am contending with you, for you,

534
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,640
 and for those at Laodicea,

535
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,760
 and all those who have not met me personally.

536
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,520
 Scholars kind of across the board agree

537
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,720
 when he says contending, he's sitting in a prison cell

538
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,960
 and he's pointing to prayer.

539
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,280
 That Paul says, I want you to know how hard I'm praying

540
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,600
 for you people, even though you've never met me before,

541
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,280
 and I'm praying that God would allow you,

542
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,240
 that my goal is that you would be encouraged in heart

543
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,560
 and united in love.

544
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,360
 And in reading this, I was like so just amazed

545
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,080
 at how much love Paul has.

546
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,600
 I mean, I've never met you people,

547
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,840
 but I'm spending hours in this little prison cell

548
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,920
 praying that you would be encouraged in heart,

549
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,000
 encouraged in love, even though I've never met you.

550
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,040
 I mean, Paul, most of us don't pray for our friends

551
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,600
 or family unless they're sick.

552
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
 And Paul's going, I've never met these people,

553
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,520
 but I am just on my face in front of God,

554
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,600
 praying that they would be not just anything,

555
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,680
 but encouraged and united in love.

556
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,760
 I mean, it becomes further even, wow, that's crazy love,

557
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,720
 when you contrast it with Paul's former life.

558
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,320
 I mean, Paul was the artist formerly known as Saul.

559
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,200
 Remember Saul?

560
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,280
 Saul was the guy who tried to stomp out

561
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,480
 the Christian movement, who literally head up

562
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,080
 persecuting and killing Christians,

563
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,280
 going around trying to stomp out Jesus.

564
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,480
 And then all of a sudden, one day he's on the road

565
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,960
 and on his donkey and Jesus knocks him off and says,

566
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,560
 you're gonna come, that's a true story,

567
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,000
 you're gonna come work for me.

568
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,520
 Not like a donkey metaphor, he got knocked on his donkey.

569
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,040
 Anyways, so Jesus says, you're gonna come work for me.

570
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,240
 You're gonna come serve me.

571
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,440
 And his life was radically changed.

572
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,440
 But I mean, still, I mean, how terrible or terror filled

573
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,400
 was Saul that even after he converts,

574
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,280
 he goes to Jerusalem to meet up with the other disciples

575
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,360
 and they like won't let him in the house

576
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,240
 'cause they're like, it's Saul, oh my gosh,

577
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,680
 everybody hide, shh.

578
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,760
 And they won't let Paul in who's saying,

579
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,080
 I became a Christian.

580
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:54,240
 And yet years later, this man who had murdered people

581
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,080
 in his past is now saying, I'm just begging God on my knees,

582
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,800
 I haven't met you yet, I can't wait to,

583
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,560
 that you would be filled with encouragement,

584
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,200
 filled with love for one another.

585
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,560
 And so that, here we go, the rest of verse two,

586
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,280
 you may have the full riches of complete understanding

587
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,200
 in order that they may know the mystery of God,

588
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,640
 namely Christ, in whom are hidden all treasures

589
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,120
 of wisdom and knowledge.

590
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,680
 So I'm praying that as we know,

591
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,240
 or as we talked about in the weeks before,

592
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,200
 Colossians was like a place where they had

593
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,560
 all these competing ideas.

594
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,720
 It was like we said, Austin, like keep Austin weird,

595
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,480
 keep Colossi weird, where there were all these different

596
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,920
 ideas about, hey, what does God want?

597
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,040
 And yes, Jesus, but add some other things.

598
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,200
 And he says, no, I'm praying that you would know

599
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,120
 you're complete in Christ.

600
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,600
 That's really the whole message of Colossians,

601
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
 if you write in your Bible.

602
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,600
 He uses complete 30 times, more than any other letter.

603
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,800
 That you're complete, you have the complete riches

604
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
 of understanding.

605
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,400
 I tell you this, verse four, so that no one may deceive you

606
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,720
 by fine sounding arguments, that no one will come up

607
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,360
 and say, yeah, Jesus, but what about if the two of you

608
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,760
 are on a desert island, and that no one would deceive you

609
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,840
 with plausible arguments, that you would know

610
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,160
 Jesus is enough.

611
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,040
 Jesus is enough.

612
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,800
 Whatever you're walking through,

613
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,600
 that you would know Jesus is enough.

614
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,440
 Verse five, that for though I'm absent in body with you,

615
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,160
 I'm present with you in spirit, and I delight to see

616
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,400
 how disciplined you are, and how firm your faith

617
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,560
 in Christ is.

618
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,320
 It doesn't say how disciplined.

619
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,280
 We were talking about this as our team today.

620
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,680
 I delight to see how disciplined you are,

621
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,640
 and firm your faith in Christ is.

622
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,680
 He's not saying how disciplined, like, hey,

623
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,000
 you get up every single morning at 5 a.m.,

624
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,080
 and you have a quiet time for the next four hours,

625
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,760
 then you start your prayer life in the next six hours.

626
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,080
 He's not saying that.

627
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,560
 Those are great things.

628
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,480
 You have a great schedule, I guess, if you do that, kind of.

629
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,120
 But he's not saying that by discipline.

630
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,440
 He's speaking to a group of people that don't have Bibles.

631
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,080
 He's saying, look, I want you to hold on

632
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,720
 that Jesus is enough.

633
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,640
 Jesus is enough.

634
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,680
 He paid for everything.

635
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,520
 You don't need to add anything to it.

636
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
 Be disciplined, stand firm.

637
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,120
 I wanna come and see that you believe Jesus is enough.

638
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,640
 There's nothing that needs to be added.

639
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,120
 There's nothing that can change that.

640
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
 Jesus is enough.

641
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,560
 Hold on to that.

642
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,120
 Don't let anything slip into that.

643
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,240
 Jesus is enough.

644
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,280
 And stand firm in that.

645
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
 And here's what he says.

646
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,160
 Really, he gives us the key, and really, third point

647
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,000
 that we're gonna cover tonight,

648
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,800
 the key to living out the Christian life, verse six.

649
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,080
 So then, just as you, I love this verse,

650
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,320
 just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord,

651
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,040
 continue to live your lives in him.

652
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:48,120
 Just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord,

653
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,360
 continue to live your lives in him,

654
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,160
 which begs the question, how did they receive Christ?

655
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,200
 Paul, you're saying, look, basically he says,

656
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,080
 hey, finish how you started.

657
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,680
 The Christian life is finishing how it began.

658
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,480
 That's how you live the Christian life, Paul says.

659
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,920
 Continue to live, well, how did they receive him?

660
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:13,200
 Total trust, total dependence.

661
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,480
 In other words, they didn't come,

662
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
 God, I'm gonna try to be good,

663
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,680
 and you on the cross, you pay for a lot of that,

664
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,720
 and so I'm gonna work my way.

665
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,560
 It wasn't that at all.

666
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,840
 It was, God, I'm totally dependent on you

667
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,640
 if I'm gonna have eternal life.

668
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,000
 I'm totally dependent on you

669
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,400
 if I'm gonna have a relationship with you,

670
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,480
 because no matter how good I think I am,

671
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,580
 I'm not good according to comparison with you.

672
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,400
 It was total dependence, and Paul says,

673
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,080
 the same way that we live or we get access to eternal life

674
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,460
 is the same way we live the Christian life.

675
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,640
 And this is so huge, because the Christian life

676
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,580
 is not just hard, it is impossible.

677
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,120
 It is impossible for you alone.

678
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,360
 The Christian life is not just like,

679
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,080
 yeah, just try a little harder.

680
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,340
 It's impossible, and Paul says, look,

681
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,240
 don't get away from this.

682
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,320
 You finish how you started, totally dependent.

683
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,960
 And every moment, moment by moment, dependence.

684
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,200
 God, I can't, but you can.

685
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,200
 I can't walk through the anxiety that I'm feeling

686
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,440
 as I just look towards not having a job,

687
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,360
 but you can, and you can through me.

688
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,240
 I'm trusting you, will you help me?

689
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,600
 This moment by moment, dependent relationship,

690
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,320
 Paul says, that's how you live the Christian life,

691
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,600
 totally dependent on him.

692
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:46,120
 I think really, Cali, who's my wife's car,

693
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,160
 in some ways is like, continue to be such

694
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,360
 a illustration of this, where,

695
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,960
 or this last idea of just keep coming back to him,

696
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,520
 keep coming to him, moment by moment, dependence.

697
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,960
 Dependence, even just as you walk through your day,

698
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,380
 God, will you help me now?

699
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,720
 God, you know how I'm feeling.

700
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,400
 God, I'm feeling so alone.

701
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,700
 I'm so tired of being single.

702
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,320
 I'm feeling so full of shame

703
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,160
 that you take all those things, you keep coming to him,

704
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,240
 you keep walking, keep trusting

705
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,240
 that God is good, his word is true.

706
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,160
 I'm gonna keep trusting you, totally dependent on you,

707
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,720
 moment by moment, keep coming back to him.

708
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,280
 My wife's car, when she got it, she was in grad school,

709
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,200
 and so she had no money, and so anytime something bad

710
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,880
 would happen to the car, she was back to Charlie.

711
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,000
 Anytime she got in a wreck, and not even just bad stuff,

712
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,760
 like in keeping the maintenance, Charlie was the one

713
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,640
 that she would come back to, and he would help

714
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,880
 kind of walk through, this is what you need to do,

715
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,520
 here's the oil change, every X number of miles,

716
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,520
 you need to get this done, and he instructed

717
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,240
 how to maintain this gift.

718
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,520
 Also, when she would get in a wreck,

719
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,880
 it would go back to Charlie, and she would keep coming

720
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,240
 back to him on those wrecks, which happened a lot.

721
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,200
 They say something about our driving.

722
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,960
 I'm gonna pay for that later.

723
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,000
 (audience laughing)

724
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,120
 But it's kind of worth it.

725
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,720
 Anyways. (audience laughing)

726
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,120
 Man, I'm gonna pay more now.

727
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,400
 Gosh, I love you guys, that's what this is about.

728
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
 Okay, so she just kept coming back.

729
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,120
 In any situation, this is what she would do.

730
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,800
 If I got in a wreck, I'm coming back to you.

731
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,640
 If I get in trouble, I'm coming back to you.

732
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,240
 When things are going well, I'm coming to you.

733
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,800
 You know how to best care for this gift

734
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,020
 that you've given me.

735
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,480
 And in essence, that's the Christian life

736
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,960
 that Paul says, you just keep coming to him.

737
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,160
 If you're walking through shame from adultery

738
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,760
 committed this weekend, you just keep coming to him.

739
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,160
 If you're walking through just a season of life

740
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,880
 where you're going, God, I hate where I am right now,

741
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,040
 you just keep coming to him, tell him that.

742
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,260
 He wants this moment by moment dependence.

743
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,800
 When things are going well, when things are going bad,

744
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,240
 you continue to keep coming back to him.

745
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,420
 You keep coming and living in relationship with him.

746
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,060
 I mean, if Charlie, who is wicked,

747
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,380
 it's not personal, Charlie, it's what the Bible says,

748
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,980
 that he is not compared to God,

749
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,200
 and just in general, we all are, wicked,

750
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,640
 knows how to love and care for this girl

751
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,440
 who he's embraced as a daughter.

752
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,760
 How much more does your heavenly father

753
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,120
 want you to come to him?

754
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,640
 I love you enough to die for you,

755
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,520
 will you just keep coming back to me, moment by moment,

756
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,020
 totally dependent on me.

757
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,240
 Whatever you're walking through,

758
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,560
 that he's the first person we turn to,

759
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,480
 that we would keep coming to him.

760
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,920
 There were times where Callie, my wife, again, with the car,

761
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,640
 she would, something would happen

762
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,000
 or she'd get a fender bender, and she'd go, oh my gosh,

763
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,740
 she wouldn't bring it back there,

764
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,320
 even though she couldn't afford to have it fixed,

765
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,840
 she'd go, I'll just not drive it for a little while,

766
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,400
 I feel like there's been too many of these lately,

767
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,340
 and there have, I'm sorry, I'm paying the insurance now.

768
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,200
 But she would just not drive it.

769
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,640
 And then Charlie found out, and he's going,

770
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,840
 what are you doing, bring that to me,

771
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,680
 of course I wanna take care of it, I love you.

772
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,640
 I mean, how much more does your heavenly father,

773
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,000
 when you're walking through and you've blown it,

774
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,460
 and will you just come to me, I've paid for it.

775
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:55,500
 I wanna tell you how to maintain, how to live out this life,

776
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,980
 I wanna instruct you from my words, will you come to me,

777
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,300
 will you keep coming to me, I love you.

778
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,660
 And that's the invitation he gives all of us,

779
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,820
 that not just eternal life,

780
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,820
 but Paul says how we live this life in Christ,

781
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,300
 totally dependent.

782
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,860
 And I wanna live this way.

783
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:24,900
 I read Paul's words and I go, I wanna have that hope,

784
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,780
 God, will you help me, I wanna have that hope.

785
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,740
 I wanna be fixed on no matter what I'm walking through,

786
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,700
 I wanna stand firm that there's coming a day

787
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,220
 where all of this is gonna be behind us,

788
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,660
 it's gonna be over like that,

789
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,980
 and the war will be won, I will be home.

790
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,500
 I wanna make sure that I proclaim Jesus first,

791
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,420
 I don't want anything to get in the way,

792
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,460
 or make someone think that Christianity's about

793
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,900
 not smoking or not swearing unless you're in traffic,

794
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,260
 or not anything, it's about Jesus.

795
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,260
 And I wanna live in dependence on him,

796
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,740
 and I think that's what he wants for all of us.

797
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,700
 I think that's what Paul would say,

798
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,500
 that's how you can live this life,

799
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,420
 that's how you can live this life.

800
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,700
 And that's the invitation he's given all of us

801
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,780
 to experience, not eternal life alone, but abundant life.

802
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,940
 I'm gonna pray, we'll close out.

803
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:29,580
 Father, we love you, and man,

804
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,340
 we need your help to love you more.

805
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:37,460
 Thank you that you haven't left us just to try harder

806
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,400
 to do what is impossible,

807
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,100
 but you offer us a way.

808
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,900
 You offer the same way that we got in

809
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,660
 is the same way we now live out.

810
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,400
 Thank you that you're coming back.

811
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,060
 Lord, we pray that you would come quickly.

812
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,300
 Your bride, the Christ, says, "Come, Lord Jesus."

813
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,700
 Would you help us to proclaim your son

814
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,460
 the hope of the world, the hope for those of us

815
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,940
 who know him in our hearts?

816
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,520
 Proclaim that he's come, he's coming again,

817
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,080
 he loves humanity enough to die for them,

818
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,680
 and he offers new life to anyone.

819
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,080
 Just take the free gift.

820
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,400
 Would we be diligent, would you powerfully work in us

821
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,680
 who know you to take that free gift?

822
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,600
 We love you, we need you, amen.

823
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,760
 need you. Amen.
