[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:22.940]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.880]   Hey, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.980]   friends in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, Phoenix,
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.980]   Northwest Arkansas, Tulsa, wherever you are joining us from,
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.700]   Cedar Rapids, we are excited to continue this series.
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.540]   Anyone been on vacation here recently?
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.820]   Nice, just got back from vacation, it was awesome.
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.060]   But I'll tell you about the first day on our way
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.940]   to that vacation, give us some tracks for where we're going.
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.740]   It was last Saturday, had planned a vacation with my wife,
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.140]   first time, no kids in a long time,
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.660]   we're going on vacation, going to Mexico,
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.340]   it's gonna be great, just her and I,
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.880]   go get some sun, get to hang, just the two of us,
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.220]   so excited, months in advance, thinking about this,
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.100]   talking about this, it's gonna be great, just so stoked.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.900]   The day comes, Saturday morning, we load up the kids,
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.380]   take them to grandma's house,
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.740]   and whenever you have little kids,
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.780]   there's like all kinds of just a million different things
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.260]   that you've gotta get grandma all equipped for,
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.220]   so we're bringing over pack and plays,
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.740]   which essentially like a movable crib,
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.500]   and a bunch of other toys, we're getting her all set,
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.020]   got all the things done, and it ends up taking us
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.940]   a little longer than we thought to tell grandma.
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.540]   So now we're running a little bit late,
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.780]   we get in the car, that's okay,
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.320]   we're going on to Mexico, it's gonna be awesome.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.020]   Get in the car, we're driving, we're headed to the airport,
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.100]   and we're kinda make up time,
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100]   or trying to make up time, it's Saturday morning,
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.720]   and as we approach the airport, DFW,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.500]   what begins to go through my mind is my wife is driving,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.420]   and I begin to think, man, there's an exit up here,
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.380]   and if you don't see the sign,
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.740]   it's really easy to miss the exit, to go over here,
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.220]   but I'm sure she won't do that,
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.980]   and she's much smarter than I am, so I'm sure we'll be fine.
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.260]   We're getting close to the exit,
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.500]   we're getting close to taking it,
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.200]   the sign's right there, I see it happen,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   and my wife just continues driving.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.360]   And so we're now, we've completely missed it,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.340]   and what's going through my head
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.000]   is actually a very proud moment,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.260]   'cause normally, gentlemen,
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.100]   let me give you a little free advice,
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.380]   the time to criticize your wife when you're driving
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.960]   is not while you're sitting in the car together.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.580]   It never goes well.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.500]   So thankfully, for whatever reason,
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.060]   what went through my head of, oh my gosh,
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.580]   you can't believe it, I saw that coming a mile away,
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.300]   and literally miles away, and we missed it,
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.120]   but what went through my head is after she said,
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.080]   oh no, I missed it, I was like,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.660]   oh, it's okay, it's easy to miss,
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.140]   and it was the biggest moment in marriage history for me.
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.900]   I just gotta get that off my chest.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.740]   (laughing)
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.340]   Don't clap at that.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.820]   Yes, that's it.
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.740]   So tonight, I wanna just teach you my ways,
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.060]   and no, that's not it at all, it has nothing to do.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.260]   Anyway, so we keep going,
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.340]   and we missed, in missing the sign,
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.420]   or to hurt him, missed the sign,
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.660]   we missed the exit to the airport.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.780]   So of course, and we scramble,
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.660]   we try to find the next one,
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.020]   and we try to find out to get off
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.260]   and get back as quickly as we can,
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.540]   'cause we're already running late,
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.940]   but because we missed the sign,
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.540]   we missed the exit to our destination,
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.900]   or we missed getting off at the right time.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.700]   What does that have to do with what we're talking about?
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.220]   Well, tonight, we're continuing the series,
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.140]   Before There Were Kings,
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.380]   where we're looking at the book of Judges,
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.980]   and these different men and women
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.660]   in the nation of Israel's history,
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.380]   and their stories, and how they connect,
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.060]   really, God's principles through them
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.180]   connect to our lives today.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.000]   And tonight, we're gonna look at the story
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.780]   of the most famous of all the judges, without question.
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.380]   And he was a guy that,
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.300]   though he was incredibly strong on the outside,
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.820]   he had a weakness for the ladies.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.860]   And he had a couple relationships
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.180]   that he, in going along the journey,
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.060]   he missed the signs that,
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.180]   "Hey, buddy, you need to exit right now.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.480]   "This relationship needs to end.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.540]   "There's a sign, you need to exit, you need to get off.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.600]   "This shouldn't keep going.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.340]   "It should never have begun," in one of the cases.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.020]   And we're gonna look, because some of the principles,
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.580]   or some of the things that he failed to identify
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.640]   that would have told him, had he seen those signs,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.620]   or had he known, this is a sign that means,
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.540]   "I need to exit the relationship, I need to break it off,"
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.500]   it would have prevented all kinds of pain in his life
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.540]   and the lives around him.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.940]   And tonight, we're gonna talk, as it relates to you,
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.460]   and to me, inside of our dating relationships,
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.260]   some of the exit signs
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.560]   that you need to exit this relationship right now.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.780]   So if you are dating in the room,
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.980]   if you hope to date in the room,
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.380]   if you are engaged in the room,
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.140]   wherever you are at in terms of relational status,
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.320]   this is applicable to you,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.260]   because God, who cares about you,
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.100]   wants to make sure
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.500]   that you don't wind up at the wrong destination.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.980]   He wants to make sure that you exit when you see the sign.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.700]   And there are some very clear ones that would indicate,
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.140]   "Hey, this is a relationship that should end."
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.620]   And so before I go there, let me just acknowledge this.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.560]   Dating is hard, and you may be sitting there being like,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.400]   "What do you know?
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.220]   "You've been married,
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.100]   "and you don't know how hard it is in general."
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.940]   There's some things,
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.140]   even though I've been out of the dating game for a while,
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.300]   I still know that there are some challenges that come
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.140]   as it relates to dating.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.100]   In fact, I had a friend that sent me
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.300]   a couple of these memes this week
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.940]   that show the foreverness of dating.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.060]   Here was one of them that came as it relates to,
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.080]   "Here's what dating is.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.920]   "Welcome to dating.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.880]   "These are your two options.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.300]   "Stay together forever or break up.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.140]   "No pressure."
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.220]   It's like, "Thank you."
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.060]   I mean, it is.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.820]   It's like, "Oh man, this is such a big deal."
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.900]   And it is a big deal in life.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.560]   Here's one that I don't have as much territorial,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.260]   or I'm not familiar with the territory,
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.840]   related to not seeing the exit signs,
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.300]   that I'm gonna hold on and make this thing work
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.660]   and try to avoid seeing the sign
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.440]   'cause I don't wanna get off yet.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.600]   Or here's probably the most 21st century one
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.980]   as it relates to bumble.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.340]   For any bumblebee ladies in the room,
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.340]   "Hey, my roommate went on a bumble date."
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.060]   (laughing)
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.200]   What I love about this,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.300]   you gotta know that she's saying her roommate.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.820]   It's definitely Sid who did that.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.300]   And she is saying, "My roommate."
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.180]   But dating is hard.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.660]   And it is a thing where it is easy enough
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.740]   to miss the signs that you should exit.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.060]   But the good news is God has given some clear instructions.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.940]   And so what I wanna do tonight is as best I can
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.620]   remove some of the signs that,
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.000]   hey, you may blindfold yourself and you may still miss it,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.300]   but to whatever degree I can say,
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.940]   "Hey, these are some clear indicators
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.400]   "from God who loves you.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.540]   "He's crazy about you.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.440]   "He cares about you.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.780]   "He cares about your marriage.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.980]   "He wants you to experience a marriage
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.260]   "that's beyond anything like you could believe,
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.620]   "better than you could hope for yourself."
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.780]   That's what he wants for you to experience in marriage.
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.140]   And he's given some clear exit signs.
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.320]   It's time for you to get out.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.020]   So we're gonna look at two relationships
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.020]   from the story of Samson.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.340]   You may know some things about Samson.
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.180]   You probably know the most famous of his relationships,
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.540]   a girl by the name of Delilah.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.340]   Man, live in infamy.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.380]   Delilah, and he also had a broken engagement.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.060]   Samson was engaged, had a fiance,
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.980]   and we're gonna look at both of these relationships.
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.620]   Quick recap, in case you're joining us for the first time.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.580]   Before there were kings,
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.300]   why are we calling the series that?
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.660]   The series is looking at the book of Judges.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.700]   What is a judge?
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.060]   A judge was someone that didn't look like Judge Judy
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.980]   and have a gown and gavel.
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.340]   It was someone that God raised up.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.660]   Essentially, it's the word deliverer in Hebrew.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.620]   Someone that God raised up,
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.820]   and the nation of Israel would sin and rebel against God.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.980]   They'd find themselves basically enslaved,
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.020]   and God would raise up a deliverer
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.540]   to go and set them free.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.220]   Now, this deliverer is by far the most infamous
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.060]   of all of them,
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.740]   and is the only one with supernatural power.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.220]   He is the Old Testament version of the Hulk.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.980]   So he has supernatural strength.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.320]   Samson, from a very young age, you probably know that.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.280]   You probably know Delilah.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.120]   What you may not know,
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.380]   and this is relevant to what we're gonna look at today,
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.980]   is that Samson had been set apart in a unique way
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.460]   by God from his birth.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.940]   In other words, God shows up,
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.140]   an angel comes to his parents.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.700]   His parents were having trouble getting pregnant.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.540]   Angel shows up, says,
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.860]   "Hey, you're gonna have a baby boy.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.180]   "This baby boy is gonna be different
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.860]   "than all other baby boys."
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.300]   He has three to-do lists for the rest of his life
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.780]   that God has placed on him,
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.180]   or three to-dos, three things not to do, really,
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.060]   that God wants him to do.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.180]   And he gives them a Nazaritic vow.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.000]   What's that?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.840]   It's just basically God saying,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.440]   "Hey, this is a child who is special, unlike others,
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.580]   "so I have some special things I want him to do."
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.100]   Three requirements, Samson.
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.020]   They were, hey, you can't cut your hair.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.900]   So likely he had dreads,
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.540]   most unusual of all of the things, probably.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.200]   Hey, you can't have alcohol, so no.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.660]   Mambo taxis, margaritas, corona, none of that for Samson.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.540]   And then the final one was,
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.940]   hey, you can't touch dead people.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.820]   In that time, it just basically would defile.
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.220]   But God said, "Hey, you're special, you're set apart.
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.300]   "These are three things that I want you to not do."
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.500]   And so his parents told him,
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.720]   "Hey, these are three things that are off-limits for you."
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.140]   And we're gonna look at Samson and his life,
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.900]   and particularly these two relationships,
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.720]   and extract some of the principles from God
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.180]   as it relates to finding the right person,
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.420]   or exit signs that if this applies to you,
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.280]   you should exit now.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.920]   And we're gonna, really, what I'm gonna do
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.180]   is I'm gonna play the movie of his first fiance,
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.780]   pull two takeaways,
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.500]   and then we're gonna look at that famous girl Delilah,
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.900]   and pull a third takeaway as it relates
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.040]   to when you and I should exit the dating relationship.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.580]   So this will be from Judges 6, 14, I'm sorry.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.860]   And we will pick it up on Samson's story.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.540]   If you don't have a Bible, it will be up on the screens.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.380]   No worries.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.300]   And I'll start in verse one of chapter 14.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.080]   One day, when Samson was in Temna, it's just a town,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.880]   there was a Philistine woman,
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.400]   Philistine is like the villains in the story,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.520]   they're the enemies of God.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.740]   A Philistine woman caught his eye.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.920]   When he returned home to his mother and his father,
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.200]   he said, "A young Philistine woman in Temna
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.600]   "has caught my eye.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.040]   "I wanna marry her, go and get her for me."
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.220]   So Samson, right to the point kind of guy.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.520]   His father and his mother objected.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.780]   "Isn't there even one woman in our tribe
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.800]   "and among all of the Israelites that you could marry?"
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.360]   They asked, "Why must you go to the pagan,"
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.840]   that just means people who don't have a relationship
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.840]   with God, "the pagan Philistines to find a wife?
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.800]   "But Samson told his father, 'Go get her for me.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.720]   "'She looks good to me.'"
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.120]   So literally it translates, hey, she looks hot.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.040]   I like the way that she looks, she's the one,
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.760]   she's the one that I wanna marry, go get her for me.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.920]   Samson believed in the modern form of tender dating.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.400]   Swipe right, she's for me.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.120]   So Samson's parents, they go get her
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.760]   or they begin to go set up the conversation.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.280]   Samson, we're told, is on his way to go meet her
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.200]   for the very first time and he knows nothing about her
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.600]   other than she looks good in jeans and I like that.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.160]   And so he's on her way to meet her
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.720]   and he don't wear jeans at that point,
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.480]   whatever they were wearing, he liked it.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.520]   On his way to meet him and all of a sudden we're told
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.640]   that Samson's attacked, he's with his parents
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.960]   and a lion comes out of nowhere.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.220]   And Samson is supernaturally strong.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.600]   The text tells us that he grabs the lion
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.400]   and he tears it apart.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.240]   I love this next part of the verse.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.960]   As one would tear apart a young goat.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.500]   It's like, that's so many questions.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.720]   Who is tearing apart all these young goats?
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.600]   What does that even mean?
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.960]   But it says he tears them apart and he continues to go
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.120]   as he meets the girl and he says that he again,
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.380]   uses the same phrase, she looked really good to him.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.700]   Now he's going and his family goes to make preparations
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.960]   for the wedding and the reason the lion thing is important
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.760]   is because he walks along the road
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.640]   and he sees the carcass of the lion,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.080]   a little time goes by, he's going to be a part
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.560]   of the wedding week comes and on his way there,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.880]   he sees the carcass of the lion, he killed.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.120]   And inside of the carcass of the lion,
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.960]   a beehive had formed and had created honey
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.000]   and there were bees swarming around.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.320]   Samson goes up to it, sees the beehive and is like,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.440]   man, the honey, that looks great.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.280]   He reaches in, begins to eat some of the honey.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.480]   It's gross, but the author includes it
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.760]   because he's pointing out Samson early in the game
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.220]   is already breaking part of his vow.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.620]   One of his vows, you were not supposed to touch dead things.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.820]   Samson takes the food, he eats,
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.340]   says he brings some to his parents,
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.140]   doesn't tell him where it's exactly from
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.940]   and he continues to the wedding week.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.820]   He gets to the wedding week and we're told
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.700]   he breaks the second part of his vow.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.140]   We're told he throws a machete, which is the Hebrew word,
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.940]   he throws a party, it's basically a drinking party,
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.340]   is the same word that's used.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.220]   So he gets his guys together, it's the wedding week,
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.100]   they got seven days, he's given kind of 30 companions
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.900]   or groomsmen from her hometown, her relatives
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.460]   and all those guys, gets them together,
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.860]   decides to throw a kegger.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.860]   And he's hanging out with his guys, they're drinking
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.460]   and they do what guys do when they drink.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.260]   Now guys are, we can be stupid in general.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.060]   When you introduce alcohol, it doesn't get any better.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.020]   And so he's hanging out with these guys
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.900]   and he begins to go, you know what, I got an idea.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.940]   I just met these 30 groomsmen, we're gonna bond over this.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.140]   I got a riddle for you.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.260]   And here's what the riddle was.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.460]   And he gives them a riddle and says,
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.140]   here's what's at stake.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.300]   Samson said, let me tell you a riddle.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.580]   And if you solve my riddle during these seven days,
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.580]   so the seven pregame days of the celebration,
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.540]   I will give you 30 fine linen robes
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.100]   and 30 sets of festive clothing.
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.580]   Clothing's a big deal in that time.
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.980]   Basically, hey, I'll give you 30 men, 30 sets.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.540]   But if you can't solve it, my riddle,
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.020]   then you must give me 30 fine linen robes
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.460]   and 30 sets of festive clothing.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.020]   All right, they agreed, let's hear your riddle.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.060]   So Samson says, out of the one who eats,
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.820]   came something to eat.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.660]   Out of the strong, came something sweet.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.140]   These guys got seven days,
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.260]   their clothes are on the line, literally.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.900]   And they're thinking over, you know,
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.500]   what could this possibly be?
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.820]   Day four comes, they go to his fiance and they're like,
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.860]   hey, if you don't tell us what the answer is,
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.380]   we're gonna kill you.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.620]   It's like that escalated really quickly.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.060]   And so she begins to nag or told Samson and say,
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:15.900]   hey, tell me the answer.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.960]   You haven't told me, I'm your fiance,
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.020]   you won't even tell me the answer.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.820]   He says, no, this happens day after day
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.300]   until the seventh day, she so persists
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.900]   that he gives her the answer.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.700]   She goes and tells the men this was the answer
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.020]   and they come to Samson and say,
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.060]   hey man, out of the one who eats,
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.580]   the lion came something to eat.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.480]   And they basically say, hey, it's a lion and honey
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.980]   that you're talking about.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.300]   Samson realizes what has happened and he responds
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.580]   with not a great example of how to talk about your fiance.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.240]   Here's what he says.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.540]   If you hadn't plowed with my heifer,
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.040]   you would not have solved my riddle.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.900]   There are so many takeaways, men.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.740]   That's the moral of the story.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.940]   Do not call your fiance a heifer
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.520]   or let other men, I'm not even gonna go there.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.400]   So he basically says, if you hadn't used my fiance,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.560]   you wouldn't have answered it.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.880]   So he's now really angry at her and at the men
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.080]   who were told that he goes and enraged.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.040]   It's not what God's saying to do.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.920]   He's saying this guy was messed up.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.640]   He goes and he kills 30 men and he takes their clothes
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.440]   and he brings it back to the guys.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.060]   Again, the author is showing us he broke his vow.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.160]   How do you get clothes off of a dead body?
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.060]   You're touching dead corpses.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.100]   Now Samson, time and time again, was unfaithful
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.120]   to the things that God said, this is who you are.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.520]   You're to be set apart and different
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.560]   in the way that you behave.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.140]   He's so angry that he skips his wedding with the woman
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.040]   and he goes home to his parents and he's like,
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.820]   I'm done with this and his fiance ends up being given away
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.860]   to the best man in the wedding.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:58.000]   Yeah, and it's a tragedy.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.240]   He never should have been in the relationship
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.480]   with her at all.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.320]   It never should have begun.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.680]   It never should have gone where it did.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.720]   And yet one of the first missteps that is so common
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   that Samson took that is still so common and prevalent today
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.560]   is the first exit sign that he should have exited
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.760]   before this thing ever began.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.400]   And you, if you were in this situation, need to exit.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.080]   Immediately.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.800]   That if you are in a relationship with someone
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.000]   and they are not following God, you need to exit.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.600]   It was true for Samson.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.360]   His fiance was a Philistine, which basically,
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.840]   she worshiped a different God.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.320]   God told the people of Israel, you are not to marry
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.920]   any other nations because they worship other gods
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.440]   and they will lead your heart astray.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.240]   And so Samson, it was very clear, Deuteronomy 7 tells us
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.680]   that you are not to marry outside of that.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.640]   But it wasn't just applicable to Samson
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.960]   that you are not to marry someone.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.520]   I'm gonna talk more specifically what I mean
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.520]   by following God.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.400]   And if they're not, you need to exit.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.960]   The same principle applies to Christians today.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.520]   The Apostle Paul, 1,000 years after Samson
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.440]   would write this in 2 Corinthians 6, verses 14.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.840]   "Do not be yoked," I'll explain what that means,
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.160]   "together with unbelievers.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.320]   "For what a righteousness and wickedness have in common?
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.120]   "What fellowship can light have with darkness?
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.360]   "What harmony is there between Christ and Belial?
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.080]   "Which is essentially a false god.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.760]   "What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.760]   "Do not be yoked together with an unbeliever."
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.760]   What are you saying?
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.840]   Yoke, you're talking about eggs,
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.480]   you're talking about, what does that even mean, a yoke?
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.200]   Basically at this time, a yoke was something
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.240]   that you would put on cattle, you would put on oxen.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.480]   There'd be two oxen or two cattle right next to each other.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.680]   You would put a harness or a yoke on them
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.280]   to allow them to pull the carriage,
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.560]   to help plow the field, to pull something forward.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.120]   And if something was unequally yoked,
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.760]   it meant one of two things.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.880]   It meant, or if ox were unequally yoked,
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.120]   it meant one was able to pull much faster,
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.560]   farther, and stronger than the other.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.360]   One was much weaker than the other.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.080]   Or it meant that they were pulling in different directions.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.040]   And Paul, the apostle Paul says,
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.080]   if you're a Christian, as it relates to your relationships,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.440]   partnerships, and specifically,
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.080]   at least more clearly, your marriages,
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.000]   you should not be unequally yoked together
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.120]   or partnered together with people
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.960]   who are not on the same page spiritually
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.060]   or who are headed in different directions
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.200]   in terms of faith, in terms of what they believe.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   If you are dating someone and they are not following God,
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.460]   if they are in a season where they're wrestling
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.360]   and they're still not exactly sure what they believe
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.400]   and they're figuring it out,
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.520]   or if they're of another belief,
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.920]   you are not to date them
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.040]   and you need to exit the relationship now.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.000]   That if you don't have the same trajectory of faith,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.120]   you are headed in two different directions.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.960]   Here's the deal.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.120]   If you marry someone who doesn't share your faith,
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.780]   you are guaranteed three things.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.400]   Listen to me really closely.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.340]   And I want you to hear this.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.800]   Because one thing I'm doing ministry for the past 10 years,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.300]   the most painful part of my job
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.140]   is seeing some of the stories of broken relationships
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.480]   of people who never should have been together,
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.160]   but they fell in love.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.460]   One person in the relationship thought,
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.840]   "Oh man, I'll help and I'll work with them
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.680]   "and they'll get there
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.020]   "and I'm gonna be the light in their life."
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.400]   And with tears in their eyes,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.160]   as their heart is ripped apart,
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.660]   because they never shared the same faith,
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.300]   which meant they didn't share the same values,
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.740]   which meant they didn't see the world the same way.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.740]   And if you are dating someone who is not a believer
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.800]   or not following God with their life,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.900]   not just that they say they're Christian or non-Christian,
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.100]   not following God,
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.340]   you are headed to one of three destinations.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.320]   The first is you are guaranteeing
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.480]   that you'll be one of these places.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.160]   You will either cap your intimacy with Christ.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.780]   You are guaranteeing that you're gonna cap your intimacy
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.140]   because you're gonna be constantly around somebody
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.780]   who's not prioritizing God.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.060]   He's not spending time in God's word
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.580]   or she's not spending time in God's word.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.580]   She's not spending time in prayer.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.180]   She doesn't value things that are biblically minded.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.380]   She doesn't think like it's important
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.800]   to be a part of living for Christ inside of our city,
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.820]   having a home be a place where they're inviting neighbors in
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.260]   and caring for the lost around them.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.100]   You are guaranteeing
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.700]   you're gonna cap your intimacy with Christ
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.000]   or you're gonna live out all those different things
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.560]   and you're gonna cap your intimacy with your spouse
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.620]   because you're marrying someone who's like,
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.460]   they're doing all this stuff.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.480]   I don't know why they're doing that.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.320]   That's silly.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.560]   And the intimacy and the unity
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.440]   that God wants you to experience in marriage,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.880]   you're capping what you can.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.440]   Or the third one would be
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.640]   that you're ultimately headed to a place
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.720]   where the relationship can't last and it won't last
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   because you're committing a covenant
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.360]   or you're getting into a covenant relationship
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.300]   with someone who doesn't first
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.420]   have a covenant relationship with God.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.460]   If anyone has anyone or anything
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.360]   as their first love other than God,
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.300]   you are stepping into dangerous territory
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.600]   and you should exit now.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.460]   Is it a bad idea just to date?
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.660]   Like maybe we're just kind of dating and who knows,
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.500]   maybe I'll be a step in his journey.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.220]   Yes, it is a bad idea to date.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.280]   Here's why.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.420]   Is it possible for you to fall in love
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.340]   with someone who doesn't love God?
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.260]   If you love God,
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.900]   is it possible that you could fall in love
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.060]   with someone who doesn't love God?
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.460]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.900]   And so you're gonna yoke your heart.
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.740]   You are setting yourself up for tremendous heartache
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.420]   for a future that doesn't involve
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.340]   being a part of a marriage
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.420]   where the values are the same
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.340]   and our commitments are the same.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.460]   We're gonna raise kids the same way.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.700]   We see the world the same way.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.740]   You are setting yourself up for tremendous heartbreak
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.140]   and as painful as it can be,
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.460]   or you can imagine, man,
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.740]   all the relational equity I've already put into this
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.500]   and I've already pot committed,
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.020]   you should get out now.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.460]   And you should not even date and step in that direction
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.980]   because your heart can fall in love
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.100]   with someone who doesn't love God.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.860]   And if you're going, man, but I love him,
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.780]   you clearly love him more than you love God.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.720]   If you are willing to say,
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.500]   I will live in direct rebellion to you, God,
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.440]   to get what I want, what I love,
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.220]   and the God who's there, who's not mad at you,
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.660]   he's mad about you.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.700]   He's crazy about you.
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.860]   He doesn't want you to experience that.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.260]   And he wants you to experience a relationship
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.600]   that's not marked with being on different pages
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.500]   as it relates to the most important part of your life,
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.460]   which if you're a believer is Jesus
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.020]   and your relationship with him.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.540]   Second danger just to be aware of inside of this
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.380]   is it is also not,
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.940]   I'm not saying, hey,
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.300]   date someone who says that they're a Christian.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.480]   There are a lot of people who say they're Christians.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.040]   I mean, by and large, people are like,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.660]   if you're not Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu,
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.960]   or like avid atheist,
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.380]   you're gonna get a lot of people that say they're Christian
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.980]   and they're not following Jesus.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.940]   The direction of their life is not moving towards Jesus
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.620]   as it relates to how they date, how they live,
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.260]   how they handle work, how they see the world.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.740]   They're not actually following Jesus.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.580]   They just say that they're a Christian.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.700]   And you need to make sure that you don't just,
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.540]   I mean, in this room, I wouldn't be like,
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.660]   I met him at the porch, he's for sure a great guy,
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.580]   or I met her at the porch,
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.780]   I'm sure that she's a follower of Christ.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.620]   She may not be.
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.580]   And so it's not enough to just say like,
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.420]   oh man, I'm a Christian.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.140]   What did that mean in their life?
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.340]   What do they mean by that word?
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.500]   'Cause they may be meaning something that is different
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.500]   than what the Bible says a Christian is.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.980]   They may be meaning something that's different
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.780]   than someone who is following Jesus.
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.140]   So knowing not just are they a Christian,
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.340]   but what do they mean by that?
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.380]   Like here's an example.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.340]   You could say something and it means one thing to me,
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.460]   it means something very different to you.
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.620]   Like if I was to say, hey, look,
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.980]   what are the, maybe the greatest artist of this generation,
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.700]   y'all know who I'm talking about, Justin.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.740]   I mean, he's an amazing dancer.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.500]   The dude has vocals like you wouldn't believe.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.700]   He's got shoe game, seems to be happily married,
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.360]   got a lot going for him, really talented guy.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.320]   One of the most talented musicians,
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.440]   maybe in a once in a generation kind of talent.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.940]   And by far, he was the best member of NSYNC, am I right?
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:55.280]   Now half the room is going, ah, you're talking about JT.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.080]   I thought you were talking about JB.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.960]   All the believers in the room.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.400]   Because when I said the word Justin,
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.560]   you thought something different.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.440]   In the same way, it is possible for you to say,
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.500]   oh yeah, I'm a Christian.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.200]   It is not just saying the word, it is what does that mean?
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.520]   That you don't wanna be on a different page
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.380]   of oh, they were, oh, I thought this is what they meant.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.560]   You need to make sure that they're just not a Christian
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.800]   in name, but they are following Jesus with their life.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.040]   The direction of their life is moving towards Jesus
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.260]   and following him.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.480]   As it relates to all the different areas
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.940]   and arenas of their life.
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.200]   Just because their dating profile,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.280]   man, it's more relevant than ever, candidly.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.920]   'Cause their dating profile's like, oh, they're a Christian,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.040]   this seems like a great guy.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.480]   And you will begin to convince yourself,
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.460]   I think that they're a Christian,
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.160]   they're serious about God, please.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.880]   And you are headed towards dangerous territory.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:50.380]   The trajectory of their life is not moving towards Jesus.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.240]   As Christians, as we've said a ton of times before,
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.320]   hey, we don't believe in the one.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.220]   We believe that if you're a Christian,
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.400]   there are a bunch of ones that you could marry.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.640]   If you're a Christian guy who's following Jesus,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.020]   who are those ones for you?
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.880]   A Christian girl who's following Jesus.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.240]   That's pretty much it.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.680]   If you're a Christian girl, it's the same is true for you.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   That there's not a bunch of ones,
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.800]   you're not there looking for like star-crossed lovers
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.640]   and who could they be?
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.120]   Maybe they're in India and you're not looking for that.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.920]   It's like, man, there's a bunch of ones that God says
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.720]   inside of his word, here's the ones that could fit,
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.280]   here's the ones that I could yoke with,
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.560]   and here's the ones that I could not.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.640]   Are they following God or not?
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.680]   And Samson made the decision,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.920]   hey, despite the fact that she's outside of my people,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.840]   that God says, this is wrong, I don't care.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.320]   And he makes or misses the first exit sign.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.000]   The second exit sign really is related to it
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.220]   and very similar.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.040]   And it's that he decides, hey, what's the primary criteria
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.480]   that I'm gonna decide whether or not
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.880]   to have a relationship with?
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.840]   It's how she looks.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.760]   If she looks a certain way, if she's hot,
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.720]   it's like, man, it's a lot.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.160]   I mean, we still do this today,
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.800]   where we're like, hey, look, you know,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.760]   she's, I don't know where she is spiritually,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.580]   but she's hot.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.000]   And it's a lot easier to become a Christian
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.180]   than become hot, am I right?
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.480]   And it's how we think.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.680]   Which is not true, I don't know if it is true, but.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.440]   It's still misguided thinking.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.500]   And it ended tragically for Samson.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.340]   I mean, that's what he does.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.800]   He looks, and the Hebrew word is basically,
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.980]   hey, she looks really hot.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.480]   So I'm kinda gonna work with her
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.180]   on anything and everything else.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.700]   And the defining characteristic and criteria for him
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.980]   is unbelievably shallow.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.260]   And when you date for the purpose,
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.440]   or you marry with purposes driven
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.580]   that are unbelievably shallow,
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.180]   it will end in regret and pain every single time.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.180]   The second exit sign is if all the criteria,
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.780]   all the things that are attractive to you,
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.420]   to that person, are shallow, you should exit now.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.100]   The second exit sign, and so stay with me,
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.440]   'cause you're like, yeah, I know, duh, I wouldn't do that.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.060]   This is so relevant.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.740]   I want you to, if you're dating someone in the room,
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.220]   if everything that you are attracted to in that person
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.660]   is shallow, you should exit that relationship.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.780]   What do I mean by shallow?
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.220]   I mean, the things that attract you to her
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.020]   or attract you to him are how they look on the outside,
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.740]   how tall they are, how they dress,
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.660]   how much money they make, any of those things.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.780]   If those are the criteria, the primary,
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.780]   the driving criteria, this is why I'm attracted
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.720]   to this person, you should exit the relationship now.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.220]   Because those are the things that are gonna be
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.640]   the fastest things to go away.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.900]   That if the criteria that's driving your relationship
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.900]   to keeping you together is sex, how sexy they are,
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.900]   how much money they make, how they look,
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.920]   all of those things are bad criteria
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.580]   to stay in a relationship if they are shallow,
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:33.580]   you should hit the exit button or approach the exit fast.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.260]   And I want you to think, like truly, if you're dating,
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.880]   what are you attracted to in them?
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.460]   Like truly, if you're dating someone in the room,
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.500]   you're like, hey, what are you attracted?
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.460]   And begin to think through it.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.140]   And if you like the list, well, I like the way that he looks
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.140]   and I like how tall he is and I like that, you know,
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.540]   he always picks me up on time and drives a nice car
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.140]   and I like that he comes from a wealthy family
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.960]   or I like the way that she looks in that dress
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.660]   or she's really hot, she looks like a model.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.620]   If those are the criteria, if you can't come up
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.060]   with anything that is not fleeting
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.960]   or anything that is not just shallow,
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.380]   if the things inside of you are not like,
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.920]   man, I like her character, like I see the way
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.940]   that he cares for people when no one else is watching.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.900]   Like there's something about him,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.980]   like clearly the spirit of God is at work in his life
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.920]   'cause he's not focused on like himself
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.140]   and making much of himself,
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.580]   he's focused on other people all the time.
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.840]   It's unlike anything I've ever seen.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.040]   If the criteria, if you can't think of anything
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.260]   that you are attracted to that is not superficial
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.260]   or shallow about the person that you are dating,
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.100]   you should be concerned because all of that other stuff
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:40.940]   is going away.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.580]   I mean, truly, like everything you're like,
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.620]   man, they're just so hot.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.940]   Dude, all of those things are leaving
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.620]   and what you are gonna be left with is the character,
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.380]   the integrity, the spirit of that person.
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.780]   What are you attracted to in them?
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.720]   Like guys, let me try to drive this home.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.020]   You're gonna marry someone, Lord willing, you have kids,
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.660]   their body is gonna change.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.660]   It's happening and your body's gonna change
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.300]   and your hair is gonna disappear here,
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.380]   start showing up here and it's gonna transform
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.580]   and their body's gonna change
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.900]   and you're gonna have children and stretch marks
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.620]   and you're gonna have thing curves will not stay the same,
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.020]   I can guarantee it.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:27.580]   And so if you are committed to curves or characteristics
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.660]   rather than their character, you should hit the exit button.
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.360]   You're not healthy enough to date
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.940]   and you're not ready to date.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.340]   If the only things that if like, hey, if something happened,
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.180]   they were marred by a fire and you're like, man,
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.820]   their personality, their character,
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.740]   I'm kind of repulsed by, you should break up
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.140]   because physical characteristics are going away.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:55.620]   Botox, there's only so much Botox a person can do.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.740]   And then they start looking like they were made
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.080]   in a plastic factory.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.580]   And truly, I mean it, I'm grieved,
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.300]   I can think of names and friends
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.260]   who married the hottest girls, guys would say of all time
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.540]   and they're miserable.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.740]   Because the problem is not they were pretty on the outside,
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.420]   it's that they had no character on the inside.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.780]   And ultimately what matters most,
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.100]   ultimately the thing that will last
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.500]   is not what you see on the outside,
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.560]   it is what is seen on the inside.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.360]   And looks can be deceiving.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.700]   And if you don't take into account what is on the inside
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.860]   because you're just focused on the outside,
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.020]   it's gonna cost you.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.220]   It's like this, what's your name?
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.760]   Yeah, both of you.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.320]   Solomon, Solomon and?
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.040]   Logan, Logan, I got two bags here.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.160]   There's something, there's a treat for each of you
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.080]   inside of these two bags.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.560]   These bags represent your future wife.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.760]   So inside of there, their name is actually written.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.600]   We're gonna do the ceremony, no, it's not a troll.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.640]   Which bag, Logan, would you like to pick?
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.040]   Tom Thumb.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.480]   Logan would like to bring Tom Thumb,
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.360]   a marginally overpriced grocery store,
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.640]   to wed with his life.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.920]   Okay, inside of that one,
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.280]   and this leaves our leftover Nordstrom bag.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.960]   We're inside of the Nordstrom bag, we've got something,
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.960]   and inside of the Tom Thumb bag, we've got something.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.160]   Inside of the Tom Thumb bag, Logan, you picked correctly.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.120]   I think you knew where this was headed.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:33.520]   You have just won $100 just for sitting in that seat, Logan.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.320]   (congregation applauding)
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.520]   You're gonna clap it up.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.200]   Maybe if you're dating someone,
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.600]   you can take them out on a nice date with this.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.840]   Solomon, you picked a nicer bag,
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.880]   or were given a nicer bag,
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.760]   a very pretty bag on the outside, Nordstrom's,
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.400]   great retail store,
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.000]   and you've won three cans of sardines also for a date.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.600]   Because unfortunately, though,
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   this bag was much nicer on the outside,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.940]   what mattered more, or was of more value,
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.160]   was clearly what's on the inside.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.000]   And in the same way, if you take into account,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.680]   or you fail to take into account,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.880]   yeah, good luck, guys.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.620]   Like you to report back how you used that $100, Logan.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.160]   What her name is, where you take her,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.200]   open the door, please.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.500]   Hey, if you fail in selecting,
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.440]   oh, that's precious.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.400]   If you fail (congregation laughing)
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.400]   in selecting your spouse to take account what is inside,
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:35.520]   you lose, because that is the thing that will last.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.180]   And I feel like no matter how hard I hit this,
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.880]   most of you, or many of you, are not gonna believe me.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.900]   Marriage is challenging,
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.560]   but even as challenging as marriage, life is hard, man.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.800]   And you're gonna walk through life,
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.820]   and it's gonna be painful,
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.660]   and you're gonna have friends,
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.960]   or you're gonna experience infertility, cancer,
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.700]   death of family members,
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.840]   little kids that will drive you nuts,
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.680]   and their greatest thing ever,
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.520]   but it's also like the yelling, I can't take it.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.140]   And if you don't have a relationship
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:08.980]   that is yoked together,
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.120]   or you don't have someone you're walking through
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.520]   that has character, that's gonna be an amazing mom,
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.340]   or an amazing dad that can come alongside of you.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.240]   My wife and I don't have a perfect marriage,
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.080]   but we have a marriage,
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.480]   and I'm so lucky and so fortunate
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.500]   that my wife, I married someone of character.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.960]   So we had conflict last night,
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.480]   and she is someone, generally,
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.560]   almost all the conflict is because of me.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.800]   Truly, that's not me just saying that.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   It's like, she is the closest to Jesus person in our family.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.380]   And yet, it is her character
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.600]   that allows us to walk through that,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.720]   to come alongside, to call me,
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.380]   to, hey, I'm not going to allow you
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.440]   to lead in that way and call me for it,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.600]   to be a better husband.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.240]   You wanna marry someone that has character,
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.680]   and as much as all the different world around us is saying,
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.920]   hey, what really matters is how hot they are,
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.680]   if you don't take into account what's on the inside,
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.560]   you will lose, and you can take it to the bank.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.160]   And so if you are only dating them,
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.080]   or if the sum total, really the primary total,
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.040]   and you know it's true,
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.240]   you can't think of like, man, their character
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.320]   is what attracts me to them.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.700]   You should exit the relationship now.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:24.920]   The preference is, this is just,
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:30.500]   ladies, if you catch a guy with your body,
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.180]   you're gonna lose him for your body.
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.900]   You know, there's a study done not long ago
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.100]   that showed that the attraction ages
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.960]   of men and women are so various,
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.100]   that for women, it basically,
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.800]   there's a kind of continuum of the age
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.980]   that they find attractive.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.740]   In fact, you can just throw that slide up there,
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.980]   where they basically found that, hey,
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.420]   if you're a woman, the ideal age of attraction,
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.380]   they did survey thousands of women,
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.220]   they basically found out, hey,
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.580]   based on the age that you are,
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.340]   here's the age that you're ideally attracted to,
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.380]   lots of pictures of men,
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.540]   and here was, if you were 21,
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.820]   you were attracted to 23-year-old,
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.260]   30, you're attracted to 30,
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.780]   women, if you're 42, 39,
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.780]   they basically went, like,
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.100]   here's kind of the age of attraction,
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.660]   the women are on the left.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.620]   Then they surveyed the men,
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:11.940]   and the men, they found that if you're 20,
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.060]   you like a 20-year-old,
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.140]   and if you're 49, you like a 20-year-old.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:20.180]   Now, this is not all men,
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:23.780]   and it's definitely not godly men
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.020]   that are saying, hey, ultimately,
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.420]   this is what I'm looking for in life,
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.420]   but it is a lot of men,
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.380]   and if you date someone,
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.460]   if you marry someone,
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.620]   or if you're in a relationship with someone
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.100]   who really wants you for your body,
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.460]   like, I heard, had someone tell me not long ago
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.420]   that when they were getting engaged or married,
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.860]   their now husband was like, hey, here's the deal,
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.020]   if you gain this much weight, I'm out.
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.540]   She should have said, I'm out.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.220]   And if you are dating someone,
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.940]   or using your body to get a date with someone,
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.700]   you should hit the exit sign now,
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.500]   because just like you got him 'cause you're 22,
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.100]   you are gonna lose him to a 22-year-old,
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:57.940]   because that's the type,
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.140]   I've already said, this is what values,
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.060]   this is what I value most in life.
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.300]   And so if someone that you're dating,
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.940]   the person you're dating,
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.780]   doesn't see character,
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.700]   or you don't find character to be the quality
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.780]   that is driving and attracting,
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.580]   you should exit the relationship now.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:18.420]   So Samson finds out his fiancee marries another man,
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.940]   and really, things kinda go downhill from there.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.780]   He ends up sleeping with a prostitute.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.060]   He gets kind of in this big feud with the Philistines.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.420]   At one point, he takes a donkey bone,
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.020]   kills a thousand other guys.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:31.700]   I mean, Samson was savage, if nothing else.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.380]   But his relational life just doesn't get much better,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.940]   and eventually, he falls in love with the most famous
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.220]   of maybe all women inside of the Old Testament, Delilah.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.500]   And here's what happens in verse four of chapter 16.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.660]   "Sometime later, Samson fell in love
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.900]   "with a woman named Delilah,
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.060]   "who lived in the valley of Sorek."
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.420]   So the Hulk loves a valley girl.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.980]   Tale as old as time.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.500]   "The rulers of the Philistines went,
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.740]   "and they said to her, 'Entice Samson
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.180]   "'to tell you what makes him so strong
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.460]   "'so he can be overpowered and tied up securely,
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.860]   "'and each of us will give you 1,100 pieces of silver.'"
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.380]   1,100 pieces of silver, basically,
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.820]   this was the equivalent to between 15 and $20 million.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.260]   So basically, like, hey, we will give you enough to retire
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.460]   if you will find out what makes this guy so strong.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.900]   So she is the definition of gold digger, silver digger.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.380]   "So Delilah said to Samson,
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.200]   "'Please tell me what makes you so strong,
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.620]   "'what it would take to tie you up securely.'
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.540]   "Samson replied, 'If I were tied up
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.820]   "'with seven new bow strings that have not yet been dried,
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.940]   "'I would become as weak as anybody else.'"
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.020]   So really, the same thing begins to happen over and over.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.380]   So seven bow strings, she goes, she gets 'em,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.620]   he sleeps, she ties 'em up, then she says,
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.740]   "Samson, the Philistines are upon you, they're here."
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.980]   He wakes up, snaps the bow strings,
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.500]   and she's like, "You lied to me, you lied to me,
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.380]   "I can't believe you lied to me,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.380]   "why won't you tell me the truth?"
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.060]   And really, the same thing happens over and over again.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.380]   He says, "Oh, I was kidding,
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.500]   "if you tie me up with brand new ropes
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.820]   "that have never been used,
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.540]   "I'll become as weak as anyone else."
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.020]   He goes back, takes another nap,
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.620]   she ties him up with new bow strings.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.900]   "Samson, the Philistines are here."
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.620]   He wakes up, snaps the strings.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.740]   At this point, if I'm Samson,
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.060]   you gotta be a little concerned,
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.560]   where you're like, "This woman keeps tying me up."
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.520]   Goes back to sleep, and again, or I'm sorry,
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.540]   she basically says again, "Hey, why you keep lying to me,
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.140]   "why won't you tell me what it was?"
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.180]   And he says, "Man, if you weave my hair into a loom,
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.140]   "it will make me weaker than any other man,
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.140]   "as weak as any other man."
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.420]   He goes to sleep, she does it again,
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.560]   and she says, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson,
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.400]   "wake up."
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.100]   He wakes up, snaps his hair out of the loom.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.140]   Again, you got so many questions,
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.240]   where you're like, "Sam, this brother loves some naps.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.420]   "This guy, three naps in a row, man."
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.680]   And she finally says, "Samson, you hate me,
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.580]   "you don't love me."
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.940]   And she begins nagging, nagging, nagging.
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.380]   She says, "How can you say I love you
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.220]   "and not tell me this?"
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.060]   Verse 15.
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:55.260]   And it says that he finally shared after she nagged him.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.020]   My hair has never been cut, he confessed.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.780]   I was dedicated to God as a Nazarite from birth.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.500]   If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me,
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.460]   and I would become as weak as any other man.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.860]   Delilah lulled him to sleep with his head in her lap.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.460]   She called in a man to shave off the seven locks of his hair.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.420]   In this way, she began to bring him down,
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.380]   and his strength left him.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.940]   Then she cried out, "Samson, the Philistines
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.540]   "have come to capture you."
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.960]   When he woke up, he thought, "I will do as before,
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.220]   "shake myself free."
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.260]   But he didn't realize that the Lord had left him.
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.460]   So the Philistines captured him,
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.480]   and they gouged out his eyes.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.080]   And they took him to Gaza,
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.380]   where he was bound with bronze chains,
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.980]   and he was forced to grind grain in the prison.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.260]   And it was tragic.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.540]   And you're sitting there, you read the story,
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.260]   and it's like, "Samson, how could you be so foolish?
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.620]   "How did you not see this coming?"
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.800]   Four different times, she's like,
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   "Hey, tell me your strength.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.000]   "You clearly have gotta believe."
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.820]   And she does it one after the next after the next.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.980]   "What did you think was gonna happen?
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.540]   "How could you be so stupid?
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.460]   "How could you make such a stupid, poor decision?"
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:06.260]   The reason was because Samson was unhealthy.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.620]   He was spiritually unhealthy.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.180]   He had been for a really long time.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.900]   It was clear that his commitment was not to God at first.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.480]   I mean, think about the story and progression in his life.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.900]   He didn't get there overnight, in other words.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.740]   He wasn't like, "You know what?
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.900]   "Today I'm just gonna tell the world my kryptonite
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.740]   "is Superman, and I'm gonna give the power over that."
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.100]   He got there slowly.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.860]   He was unhealthy, and unhealthy people
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.880]   make unhealthy decisions.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.980]   Dysfunctional people make dysfunctional decisions.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.180]   Samson got there one step after the next.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.380]   Think about the different ways that all along the story,
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.000]   he rejects the vow of God.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.980]   He touches dead bodies.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.380]   He's throwing an alcohol kegger party for his friends.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.460]   He goes and kills 30 men.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.780]   He touches dead bodies again.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.300]   He sleeps with a prostitute earlier in this chapter.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.340]   Just one decision after the next, after the next.
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.760]   Samson was not in a good place,
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.820]   and the whole point of the story shows us that.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.260]   The whole point of the story was to show
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.660]   what happens when you walk away from God.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.620]   The third idea, the third exit sign,
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.900]   the third time that you should exit,
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.580]   and candidly, this is gonna be the most relevant
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.080]   to, I think, most of the room,
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.700]   is when you are not healthy,
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.740]   you should exit the relationship.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.780]   If you're in a place where, like Samson, you're unhealthy,
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.660]   'cause here's the truth, dysfunctional people
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.200]   date dysfunctional people.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.860]   Dysfunctional people date dysfunctional people,
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.420]   and they do so dysfunctionally.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:28.460]   So if you're in a dysfunctional relationship,
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.420]   things should probably be a little bit more clear now
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.940]   that dysfunctional people are gonna date dysfunctional.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.900]   I mean, that's what happened to Samson.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.260]   Of course, like his aim was off.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.860]   He's like, here's the kind of girl that I want in life.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.420]   And inside of the room, the reason I say
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.420]   it's the most relevant is many of you,
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.700]   the thing that you need to do more than anything
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:48.700]   is not look for a spouse
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.500]   or get on another online dating profile,
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.340]   is you need to get healthy.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.620]   Like, you need to spend this season,
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.460]   right now, God has given you this season
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.180]   and wants you to experience this season of singleness.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.600]   He may be calling you to break up
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.940]   so that you can get healthy
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.340]   for the sake of your future marriage,
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.220]   for the sake of the children
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.100]   that you're gonna lead someday,
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.260]   for the sake of the parent that he wants you to become,
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.260]   and you'll never get there if you don't begin to get healthy.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.020]   What do I mean by begin to get healthy?
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.260]   I mean, you need to get in community
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.300]   and walk authentically in relationship with other believers.
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.380]   If you're not in community,
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.740]   if you don't have a group of men around you,
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.420]   if you're a guy, a group of women around you,
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.100]   if you're a girl that you can be authentic with,
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.420]   that you're being open with your struggles,
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.240]   you're confessing sin with,
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.940]   you are not going to get healthy.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:32.860]   The Bible says that confession is a part of the process
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.060]   by which God brings healing.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.500]   You're not gonna get healthy.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.420]   And unhealthy people make unhealthy decisions
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.180]   and unhealthy dating decisions.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.300]   And they begin to think, man, the best that I can do,
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.700]   I'm kind of damaged goods,
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.740]   and so of course I need to settle for this person.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.220]   If you think that way, you're not healthy.
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.860]   And you're not thinking like God thinks.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.380]   Some of you may need to go to Regen on Monday nights.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.740]   I couldn't encourage it more highly.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.700]   I've been going through Regen,
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.420]   which is a 12-step discipleship process
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.020]   that we have on Monday nights for the last 10 months.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.980]   And it just is a chance for you
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.380]   to kind of go through the journey of your soul and heart
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.300]   in ways that, man, people you need to forgive,
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.980]   amends that you need to make,
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.640]   sexual baggage that you need to confess and deal with.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.740]   And this is the time,
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.780]   before you ever get into that serious relationship,
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.900]   you need to begin healing.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.180]   Am I saying that you have to break up
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.220]   or you can't heal at all?
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.040]   No, but I'm saying there's a lot of you in the room
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.740]   that you are not going to heal and you will not get healthy
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.100]   if you're staying in that relationship
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.420]   and you need to break up.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.020]   This is your exit sign and get healthy.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.380]   And all the equity you've built
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.820]   and you've spent these three months together,
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.860]   and we got a song and it's amazing.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.320]   If you are unhealthy,
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.620]   the best chance you got, man, is exit now.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.060]   Because you're gonna date in an unhealthy way
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.980]   and you likely date unhealthy people.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.020]   Your relationship will be as healthy
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.720]   as the least healthy person in it.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.540]   How do you know if you're unhealthy?
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.460]   Like, here's some of the ways.
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.740]   If you're having casual sex, you're unhealthy.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:07.420]   If in the last relationship that you had,
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.940]   words by the other person
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.300]   or maybe by your friends around you
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.860]   or maybe by yourself, the word codependent came out,
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.220]   you're probably unhealthy.
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:19.780]   If you're looking at pornography, you're unhealthy.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.100]   If you're abusing medication or alcohol, you're unhealthy.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.740]   And the God who's there is not angry at you.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.820]   He's not done with you,
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.340]   but he wants you to use this season to get healthy.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.600]   And he's saying, man, will you allow me,
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.320]   if you will come to me, trust in me, trust in the process
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.940]   by which I've given that you can take steps to get healthy.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.580]   He's not promising you a marriage at the end of that,
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.260]   but he is promising that you will be in a place
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.940]   to step towards, if God has it for you,
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.440]   a marriage in a healthy state.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.940]   And you'll be more likely to date someone healthy.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:57.500]   If you're owned by anxiety, you're unhealthy,
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.940]   especially if you're walking through it alone.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:04.180]   If you have an eating disorder and you're hiding it,
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.940]   you're binging and you're purging,
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.220]   you're unhealthy.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:16.280]   If you're in a perpetual dating relationship
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.320]   where you guys, I mean, some of you guys
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.720]   have been dating for like 17 years, that's not healthy.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.880]   You need to break up or get married.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.180]   If you are not in community
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.240]   or you're not a part of a local church,
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.320]   you're not connected to a church
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.920]   and you claim to be a Christian, you're not healthy.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.020]   And you're not connected in the way that,
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.660]   or you're at least prideful, let me say that,
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.020]   which is kind of unhealthy.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.580]   And the God who's there, he's not angry,
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.700]   he wants you to experience, and this is the best thing
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.460]   that you can do with these years right now,
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.920]   is you put yourself in a position where,
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.500]   when it comes to who you're gonna decide to date,
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.900]   you're not gonna fall for Delilah
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.400]   'cause you're like, you crazy?
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.100]   Samson ended up going there one step at a time,
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.900]   all of a sudden it's just like, aim got off
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.440]   and who he was looking for was off
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.060]   because he wasn't healthy, 'cause he was off.
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.820]   And if you could come forward in time
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.240]   and confident, what he would say to you
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.760]   is don't fall for the Delilah.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.000]   Don't be one, don't fall for one, get healthy.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.120]   And don't be a Samson.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:20.640]   And the exit time is now to exit, break up and find healing.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.880]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.640]   Like I have a friend, a few, not long ago,
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.560]   we went out to his ranch and we were,
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.680]   there was a shooting range at his ranch.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.560]   And because we believe in the Second Amendment,
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.640]   we were out there shooting.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.480]   (congregation applauding)
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   So let's not get lost there, that's great.
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.380]   And we're out there shooting, like he had these hand held,
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.060]   we had pistols and we were just like shooting in the ranch.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.720]   All that to say, we're hanging out and shooting.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.540]   And I begin to realize that the sights on one of them,
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.580]   I'm like, is this right?
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.160]   And so I'm aiming, shoot, boom.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.720]   I'm not like quick draw or anything very impressive,
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.680]   but I at least know like, I don't think this is shooting
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.520]   where I want it to go.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.500]   I'd aim it, shoot, and then it would go in a direction
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.620]   that's like, that's clearly something is off here.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.520]   And so I'd even get closer and closer and closer
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.620]   to be like, no, I thought it was me from far away,
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.420]   now I can tell, like there's something off here.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:06.200]   Come to find out the sights on the end of the gun,
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.560]   the thing that you look through, it was all off.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.520]   And so even though I thought like,
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.760]   hey, I'm aiming at the right thing,
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.940]   it was bent in the wrong direction.
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:15.160]   So the shot was not going where I thought it would go,
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.480]   it was off.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.120]   And the only way to fix that is you gotta fix that sight.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.860]   You gotta make sure that you align with reality,
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.800]   the sights, which is the thing at the end of the gun.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.440]   You gotta make sure that your aim is not off.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.840]   Or even in your best attempts that,
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.320]   hey, I wanna be married someday and have some great things.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.240]   If your aim is off, if you are not healthy,
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.840]   you are not gonna hit the target that you wanna hit.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.160]   You're not gonna select and choose the person
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.900]   that you wanna date.
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.940]   And the best decision that you can take right now
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.240]   is to align yourself with what God says,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.840]   this is who I'm gonna look for in a spouse.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.640]   I'm not gonna fall for the lies of the world around you
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.440]   and Hollywood as though they knew anything
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.040]   about what they were talking about as it relates to marriage.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.340]   Because I'm gonna trust in what God,
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.440]   the one who created marriage,
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.160]   who ultimately marriage is all about,
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.560]   what he says matters most.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.660]   And I want this so bad for you.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:09.400]   Will you heal right now?
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.040]   God is not done with you.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.400]   Whatever your story is, if you're sitting in the room
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.560]   and you're like a godly woman, godly guy
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.420]   that never would like me, you bought a lie.
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:24.120]   But the truth is you've got to take time to heal.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.500]   There's no limit to what God could do with you.
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:31.200]   And Samson, in the pages in the story,
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.040]   the tragedy of Samson is that if you just continue
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.380]   walking down that road to unhealth,
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.960]   it will end up only costing you
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.660]   and hurting all those around you
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.760]   and hurting that relationship.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.720]   And the God who's there is crazy about you
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.640]   and he doesn't want that for you.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.460]   And the decision is you gotta exit.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.420]   No one can make that choice for you.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.900]   And this is the time and as painful as it can be,
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.480]   it is so much better to be lonely in your 20s
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.960]   or in your 30s than to be lonely,
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:04.240]   to be lonely and single in your 20s or in your 30s
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.200]   than to be lonely and married in your 40s
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.400]   and your 50s and your 60s.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.040]   And if you don't set yourself up
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.640]   and you don't partner with the right person,
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.040]   that is where you're headed.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:20.880]   When we were driving along the road, we had to decide,
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.160]   we gotta get off of here.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.280]   When I was headed towards the airport
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   and we missed the exit and we keep going the wrong way,
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.960]   we gotta get off of here as soon as possible
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.000]   and turn around.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.260]   We're not headed in the right direction
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.400]   towards the right destination.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.340]   We gotta exit as soon as we can.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:36.960]   And so we looked, drove, we looked for the exit,
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.400]   got off and we turned around.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.640]   There's a word in the Bible that actually signifies
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.960]   get off and turn around.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:43.920]   It's called repent.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.240]   What so many of you need to do
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:50.840]   is you need to relationally begin to repent and say,
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.320]   God, I'm not gonna do it my way anymore.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.280]   I'm not trusting in my way what I think is right,
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.120]   how I think I should date.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.040]   This is kind of my opinion.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:56.880]   Yeah, that's good for you.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.200]   But really, I think that's a little narrow-minded.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.760]   You gotta repent and decide, I'm gonna turn around.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.800]   God, I really am gonna trust you.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.640]   You invented marriage.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.320]   You're all about sex in the context of marriage.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.560]   You're all about relationships, being healthy,
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.260]   being oneness, being intimate.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.520]   And you've given kind of a model and a mandate
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.520]   for what that's to look like.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.940]   And I'm choosing, I'm gonna trust in your way,
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:20.720]   not in my way, not in the bachelor's way,
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.920]   not what society around me says,
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   not what my work buddies say marriage is all about,
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.840]   but in your way.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.720]   And you need to exit.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:31.600]   And when you do and if you do,
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.380]   there's no limit to what God will do and can do
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.440]   through you and in whatever future marriage
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.480]   maybe he has for you.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:42.140]   But he's not gonna force your car off the road.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.900]   You gotta choose to exit.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:45.960]   Let me pray.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.900]   Father, I pray for all the relationships
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:48.900]   inside of this room
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.140]   that need to end.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:03.540]   The relationships of friends that are listening
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:04.460]   that need to end.
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:11.400]   Would you right now just in the stillness
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.260]   and the quietness as we bow our heads,
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.160]   just as we pray, as we listen to you,
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.220]   to direct us, God,
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:20.280]   would you help us, I just pray for,
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.100]   there's nothing, there are things,
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.240]   but breakups are horribly painful.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.800]   And so in the midst of that,
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.980]   if that is where you lead us, God,
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:31.600]   would you surround us with your people?
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.620]   Would we tangibly feel your love
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.040]   and awareness of you would be present
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.360]   in our minds and our hearts?
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:40.640]   Would you help us walk through breakups?
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:46.260]   And help us to not walk through divorce?
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.080]   Would we exit now before exiting in a way
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:52.640]   or just seeing a total collision take place?
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.840]   I pray that you would heal all the areas
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.720]   of our hearts in this room
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.640]   where we need you to heal us, God.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.560]   We'd be a part of experiencing that through confession.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.520]   And we would begin to live and date
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.680]   and marry in a way that brings honor to you,
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.360]   that showcases to the world,
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.620]   we know what marriage is about
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:12.860]   'cause we know the one who created it, Jesus.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:18.680]   And would you form relationships in this room
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.120]   that have not yet even formed
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.140]   between godly men and godly women?
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:27.600]   Would we be your people?
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:32.320]   We love you, we worship you in song, amen.
