[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:28.480]   Thanks, guys.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.920]   Thank you.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.420]   All right, well, I'm glad to be here.
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.120]   I usually hang out with college students.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.160]   They're now gone for the summer, so I get to be here tonight
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.360]   and to hang out with you guys.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.360]   Really excited to talk about this topic tonight
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.720]   because, without a doubt, a big part of my quarter life crisis
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.160]   involved the topic that we're going to talk about tonight,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.920]   and that is the topic of money.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.880]   So when I moved here to Dallas in 2002,
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.720]   I just want to just kind of set up
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.520]   the context of my story a little bit and let you guys in
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.440]   on how this topic of money created
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.720]   such a crisis in my life.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.400]   So I moved here to Dallas in 2002 to go to seminary.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.760]   Moved here to go to seminary.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.960]   And a little bit of a picture of my financial situation
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.560]   when I moved here was this, is I was moving here,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.000]   and I had no full-time job.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.840]   I was going to be a full-time student, maybe do
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.020]   some part-time work.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.420]   I had very little money in my savings account.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.720]   In fact, the little bit I had, I burned through right away
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.360]   because I didn't have a job.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.040]   I had about $20,000 in student loan debt,
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.440]   and I was driving a car that was about nine years old
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.160]   and had well over 100,000 miles on it.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.720]   And so that was kind of my financial situation.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.560]   I was easily one of the most eligible bachelors in Dallas
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.240]   showing up with that resume.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.020]   And so it will not surprise any of you
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.680]   that I got a date right away.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.680]   So after being here a few months, I met this phenomenal girl.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.560]   Her name was Jackie, and there was like,
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.580]   everything about her was amazing.
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.680]   And I knew from the beginning that this relationship
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.220]   was gonna be very, very different.
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.720]   And so Jackie was beautiful.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.780]   She loved Jesus.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.520]   She had a servant's heart.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.280]   She laughed at my jokes.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.180]   She liked peanut butter.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.520]   She tolerated that I was a NASCAR fan.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.200]   I mean, all this kind of stuff was just, it was amazing.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.420]   I knew this relationship, like God was in it,
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.400]   but there was something even better about her
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.600]   than all of that other stuff.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.360]   And the thing that was better,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.460]   the thing that was just the icing on the cake
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.460]   is that she was an attorney.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.280]   All right?
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.720]   And so, I mean, hey, no shame here, all right?
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.380]   I was thinking, this is my sugar mama, okay?
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.840]   This is, I don't know about you guys,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.320]   but this was Psalm 37, four, just playing out,
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.660]   like delight yourself in the Lord,
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.560]   and he will give you the desires of your heart.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.000]   And at the time, I mean, moving here,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.120]   I did not know that the desires of my heart
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.200]   were a beautiful attorney that was going
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.840]   to just pay off my debt, buy me a new car,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.400]   but it sure sounded awesome.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.340]   And I thought, this is exactly the way God works, right?
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.280]   This is it.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.000]   You follow his will.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.200]   You move to Dallas.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.080]   You seek to become a pastor.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.600]   He blesses you with a rich wife, okay?
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.560]   And so that's, it's in my Bible.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.040]   I don't know about yours, but that's in my Bible.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.600]   So this relationship was amazing,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.540]   and things started heating up real quick
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.600]   and getting real serious real quick.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.760]   And so it came time in the relationship
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.640]   that Jackie and I had to sit down
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.360]   and share our financial situation.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.180]   And I was really excited about this conversation, okay?
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.920]   And so it got to that night,
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.160]   and I remember sitting on the couch going,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.100]   all right, here's my situation.
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.280]   I really don't have any income right now,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.240]   nor do I have any prospects of great income
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.760]   because I'm in seminary, okay?
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.660]   So I've got that.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.880]   I've got a used car.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.020]   I got $20,000 in student loan debt.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.080]   And at this point, I've got nothing in savings, okay?
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.120]   So there's my situation, yada, yada, yada.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.040]   You love me, all right, let's go.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.880]   What's yours?
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.700]   What's yours, okay?
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.540]   I wanna hear yours.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.240]   And that conversation didn't go anywhere close
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.320]   to how I thought it was gonna go.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.640]   She told me about her income, and I was like,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.080]   like, what's that number?
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.440]   No, that's your bonus, right?
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.520]   That's not your income.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.920]   That's your annual bonus, no?
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.080]   So she had like this much, much lower income
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.900]   than I thought.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.480]   Her car that she was driving was a lease.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.320]   She had no savings.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.880]   She had about three or $4,000 in credit card debt.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.720]   And then get this,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.040]   she had $100,000 in student loan debt.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.580]   You guys heard of Texas A&M?
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.840]   Yeah, she didn't go there, okay?
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.240]   You guys are whooping because that place is cheap
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.100]   and you got no debt, all right?
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.980]   All the different colleges in Texas
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.940]   that she could have chosen to go to,
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.420]   she said, I'm gonna go to the two private colleges.
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.500]   I'm gonna go do my undergrad at Baylor,
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.660]   and then I'm gonna go to SMU Law School,
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.940]   which, no, don't clap.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.940]   This was debt, okay?
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.100]   This was a lot of money.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.420]   That stuff is expensive.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.300]   And so here we are, I'm sitting there going,
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.220]   all right, well, I thought you were gonna be my sugar mama.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.580]   And she's like, I thought you were gonna be my sugar daddy.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.600]   And we're just sitting there going, we got no sugar.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.440]   There's nothing.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.680]   And so you know what we did?
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.520]   We got married.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.160]   'Cause all we needed was love, right?
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.400]   That that was gonna carry us through.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.660]   So here we are, late 20s.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.200]   Late 20s, we get married, and our financial situation
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.120]   is relatively low income,
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.080]   considering the amazing degree that she had.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.360]   There is no real prospects of major income,
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.080]   really, in the future.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.400]   There's one lease and a used car that's getting pretty old.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.240]   There's no savings, and there's $120,000
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.780]   in student loan debt, and we did not have a plan.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.460]   And I don't know about you guys,
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.440]   but to me, that really felt like a crisis.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.160]   When I imagined where I was gonna be
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.700]   in my late 20s financially,
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.680]   that was not where I thought I was gonna be.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.120]   That was not the script that I would have written.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.720]   And so the quarter life crisis for me
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.480]   had a tremendous amount of pressure with it.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.800]   Because I looked at the situation,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.080]   this financial situation, and it just felt very hopeless.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.720]   And I know, and I share that story,
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.440]   'cause I know that there's some of you tonight
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.880]   that your quarter life crisis regarding money
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.720]   may be exactly the same as mine,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.240]   where your situation is riddled with anxiety
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.160]   and frustration and pressure,
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.000]   because you too have a tremendous amount of debt.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.640]   You too don't have a plan.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.160]   You too feel like it's just this mountain
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.400]   that you're never, ever, ever going
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.520]   to be able to get out of.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.320]   And so maybe that's some of the circumstances
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.680]   surrounding your crisis.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.560]   Or maybe for you, your situation,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.880]   maybe you don't have a lot of debt,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.280]   but there's just a lot of fear and anxiety.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.720]   Every time you watch the news
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.240]   or read the Wall Street Journal or read the newspaper,
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.360]   and you start to hear about what's going on in the economy,
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.800]   the state of the dollar,
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.560]   you're watching where the markets are going,
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.040]   you're wondering what's gonna happen
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.560]   if there's another terrorist attack,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.960]   what's gonna happen if the global economy
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.280]   really starts to collapse
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.280]   like certain people think that it will.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.160]   And so for you, your crisis is,
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.520]   you're sitting there and you are just so, just fearful.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.560]   And what you want is you want more money
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.160]   to try to protect yourself.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.040]   And so that may be part of your crisis.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.960]   For some of you, it may be that you don't have debt
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.080]   or maybe the fear isn't getting you,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.400]   but you just always feel like
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.760]   you're trying to catch up financially.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.840]   For you, it just feels like you cannot get ahead,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.080]   you can't get anything in a savings account.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.680]   It always feels like there's a bill that needs to be paid
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.960]   and you're often running out of money
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.920]   before the next paycheck.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.400]   And it's just exhausting
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.800]   and you don't know how you're gonna get out of it.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.880]   Or for some of you, it may just be,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.400]   you're just generally discouraged
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.000]   because it seems like you feel like in your friend group,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.800]   you're the only one that has to say no.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.840]   You're the only one that can't do
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.920]   what it seems like everybody else is doing.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.120]   And so we all may have a different circumstance
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.280]   leading to our quarter life crisis with money.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.920]   We all might have different circumstances,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.080]   but what I wanna share with you all tonight
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.480]   is that the step out of our crisis,
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.880]   regardless of the circumstances,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.600]   the step out of our crisis,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.280]   in fact, the first step out of our crisis
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.920]   is going to be the exact same
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.000]   no matter what your circumstances are.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.400]   So if you've got a tremendous amount of debt
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.840]   or if you're just afraid or if you're discouraged
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.760]   or you feel like you're always catching up
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.520]   or maybe there's some other scenario
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.280]   and you feel like you're in a financial crisis right now,
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.880]   regardless of the circumstances,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.400]   the first step for you is the exact same first step
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.960]   as it was for Jackie and I.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.120]   And it's this biblical principle
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.080]   that we're gonna look at tonight.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.000]   And in my time in ministry,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.200]   and I had an opportunity to lead the Money Wise Ministry
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.920]   here at Watermark for about 18 months.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.320]   And so in my time in ministry
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.400]   and helping out with that Money Wise Ministry,
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.080]   and in my time dealing with young adults
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.840]   through the merge class,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.360]   I have seen that this principle time and time again
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.920]   provide a tremendous amount of motivation
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.360]   for people to take that first step out of their crisis.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.080]   And begin to experience some freedom
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.000]   from that crisis financially.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.280]   In fact, this principle was an enormous motivator
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.200]   for Jackie and I.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.520]   And so shortly after we got married,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.040]   we just ignored our debt situation for about six months.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.680]   And then six months after we had been married,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.200]   we came into this church in the summer of 2004.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.760]   One of the leaders of this church
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.960]   was teaching the principles
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.040]   that we're gonna look at tonight.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.200]   And it rattled our cages
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.480]   and it provided inspiration for us
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.040]   to do something about the debt.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.760]   And so we went home armed with this principle
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.160]   and we went home and we said,
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.000]   okay, we've gotta do something about this.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.400]   And we started running some numbers
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.840]   and figuring out some different scenarios
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.680]   and we started praying
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.960]   and we started having conversations
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.080]   with a lot of our friends.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.800]   And we made that, at the time to us,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.920]   we felt like some really drastic changes in our life.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.400]   And I dropped out of seminary
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.080]   and Jackie left her job and found a new job.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.560]   And by the grace of God in the late fall of 2004,
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.920]   we made our very first aggressive debt payment
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.080]   on that $120,000 in student loan debt.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.120]   In March of 2008, we made our last debt payment.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.360]   And so in less than four years,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.640]   we were able to pay that off.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.000]   Thank you.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.160]   Thank you for clapping for me doing something
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.720]   I'm legally obligated to have to do, is pay that back.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.680]   So I wore my seatbelt today.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.080]   All right, thank you.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.200]   That's amazing.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.080]   It's such an encouraging crowd.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.920]   I love it.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.640]   Okay, and so that's this principle.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.120]   So let's talk about that principle.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.080]   If you got your Bibles,
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.040]   open up to 1 Chronicles 29.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.080]   We're gonna look at this amazing prayer of David.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.200]   And Shane was referencing it a little bit during worship.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.320]   And so here's the situation of what's going on in Israel.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.160]   In the history of Israel,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.240]   this is an enormous moment for them.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.280]   Enormous moment for them.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   They are settled in Jerusalem.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.000]   David, their king, is a good king.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.320]   They had been wandering for years
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.360]   and now they're starting to put down roots.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.120]   David has built a grand palace for himself.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.680]   And he has decided that it is now time
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.240]   to build a permanent structure for God.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.240]   It is now time to build a temple for God
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.240]   because the Israelites at this point
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.160]   had to go and worship him in a tent.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.040]   And they felt like, hey, that's probably not great.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.080]   He's the God of the universe.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.000]   He owns everything.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.080]   Maybe we should build him a permanent structure.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.720]   And so David and the leaders
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.800]   went through this enormous building campaign type thing
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.720]   where they raised all of this money.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.440]   And so here's this kind of this commemorative ceremony
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.840]   where David has gathered all the leaders together.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.080]   They have raised all the money
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.520]   and they're about ready to launch
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.880]   into the building of this permanent structure for God.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.880]   It's a huge moment, a huge moment in the history of Israel.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.840]   And it also happens to be the last recorded prayer
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.400]   that we have of King David.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.760]   So these are some of his final words.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.520]   And what we're gonna see in this prayer,
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.640]   we're just gonna look at six or seven verses tonight.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.600]   We are gonna see this principle
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.920]   that if we embrace this,
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.200]   we'll be the first step out of our quarter life crisis
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.360]   when it comes to money.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.200]   And we'll completely transform
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.560]   the way we view money and possessions.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.400]   So let's look at this.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.080]   1 Chronicles 29, verse 10.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.920]   This is David.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.040]   "David, praise the Lord in the presence
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.960]   "of the whole assembly, saying,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.440]   "Praise be to you, Lord, the God of our father Israel,
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.400]   "from everlasting to everlasting.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.440]   "Yours, Lord, is the greatness and the power
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.680]   "and the glory and the majesty and the splendor."
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.400]   Get this next verse.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.960]   If you don't mind underlining your Bible,
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.360]   you may wanna underline this phrase.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.360]   "For everything in heaven and earth is yours."
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.120]   For everything in heaven and earth is yours.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.400]   "Yours, Lord, is the kingdom
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.920]   "and you are exalted as head over all.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.480]   "Wealth and honor come from you.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.080]   "You are the ruler of all things.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.480]   "In your hands are strength and power to exalt
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.920]   "and give strength to all.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.200]   "Now, our God, we give thanks and praise your glorious name."
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.480]   And then look at this.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.660]   "But who am I and who are my people
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.440]   "that we should be able to give as generously as this?
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.900]   "Everything, everything comes from you
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.000]   "and we have given you only what comes from your hand.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.760]   "We're foreigners and strangers in your sight
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.040]   "as were all of our ancestors.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.320]   "Our days on earth are like a shadow without hope.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.520]   "Lord, our God."
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.460]   Look at how he wraps this up.
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.240]   "All this abundance that we've provided
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.280]   "for building you a temple for your holy name,
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   "it comes from your hand and all of it belongs to you."
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.720]   So I don't know where your circumstances are,
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.400]   but the principle, the principle that we have to embrace,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.800]   the first step for any of us
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.760]   in getting out of our quarter life crisis
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.160]   when it comes to money
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.720]   has to be a deep, deep, deep understanding
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.020]   that we are not owners of anything.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:36.800]   David understood in the midst of this enormous moment
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.080]   where there was all of this money
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.060]   and they were about ready to embark
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.120]   on this crazy building program,
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.000]   David understood that all of that, all of that was God's.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.380]   They didn't bring anything to the table.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.440]   David understood he was broke.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.120]   All he did, all he did
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.280]   and all the rest of the leaders of Israel did
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.480]   is they just took what God in his grace
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.180]   and his mercy had given to them
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.740]   and they just turned right back around
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.940]   and gave it back to God.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.400]   The thing that David understood
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.000]   that I know it took me so long to understand and embrace
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.520]   and I know so many people struggle with is this,
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.680]   is that our relationship with money and possessions
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.300]   is not to be one of ownership,
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.760]   it is to be one of stewardship.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   Let me define what I mean by a steward.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.080]   A steward is this,
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.760]   it is somebody who manages another's property
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.920]   and seeks to manage that property
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.480]   according to the owner's vision and values.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.600]   That's basically what David was praying here.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.600]   God, everything in heaven and earth is yours,
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.880]   it's all yours, wealth and honor come from you.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.080]   God owns it all, God is the one who loans it all to you,
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.600]   he's the one who distributes it all to you,
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.000]   everything comes from your hand,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.360]   we've only given you what comes from your hand.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.160]   And all this abundance that you've provided for your temple
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.320]   comes from your hand and it all belongs to you.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.520]   Our relationship is not to be one of ownership,
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.560]   it is to be one of stewardship.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.160]   And like that blew my mind the first time I heard that.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.440]   And it completely flipped all of my preconceived notions
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.280]   about my relationship with money and possessions,
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.420]   it just turned them all upside down.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.360]   And became this enormous motivator for Jackie and I
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.920]   to finally do something about this debt situation
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.060]   that we were in and it transformed every category.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.780]   I mean, it was so far reaching,
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.240]   it completely changed the way we thought about income.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.080]   I don't know about you guys,
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.960]   but right after I graduated from college,
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.920]   I was an accounting major
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.800]   and so I was working in the accounting industry.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.320]   And so when I first graduated from college,
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.900]   I thought that income was a scoreboard.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.760]   When I had that ownership mentality,
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.880]   my income was a scoreboard,
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.200]   it was something to tell you all how successful I was.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.900]   It became this numerical determination
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.640]   of my value to the world.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.660]   And every time I got a raise or a bonus,
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.260]   there was something in me that just kind of wanted
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.580]   to well up and bow up and just kind of be like,
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.700]   yeah, that's right, they're finally starting to see
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.620]   the value that I bring to this organization,
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.020]   I think they owe me more.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.980]   Like income became this thing that made me arrogant.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:31.060]   But if we understand that we're not owners
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.100]   and we are stewards,
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.300]   then it completely changes the way we think about income.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.340]   Income's no longer a scoreboard,
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.660]   it is now an enormous responsibility.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:47.480]   This is money that the creator of the universe
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.820]   has given to me
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:54.340]   because he trusts me and he wants me to use that
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.740]   not according to my vision and values,
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.860]   but according to his vision and values.
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.780]   Completely changed the way we thought about income,
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.300]   completely changed the way we thought
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.080]   about spending and stuff.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.160]   I don't know about you guys, but the way I grew up,
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.620]   the way I grew up, money equaled fun.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.460]   That was the way that I saw it.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.140]   I mean, I didn't even grow up in Dallas, right?
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.140]   I grew up in Maryland, up in the Washington DC area,
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.800]   and I understood that, that totally threw me off.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.940]   I am so sorry about that.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.780]   I was like, are they whooping?
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.060]   Did I say A and M by accident?
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.220]   I didn't know what the whoop was, so I'm sorry.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.940]   Okay, again, forgive me.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.620]   So, all right, so I grew up in the DC area
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.780]   and it was just like this, money was just this fun thing.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.660]   This was a way to go out and have a blast.
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.140]   I mean, and I still, just a full confession,
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.820]   I still am so excited about buying new things.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.380]   Just like last week, Jackie, I came home
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.620]   and she told me the wonderful news
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.980]   that our vacuum cleaner was acting up.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.500]   And I was like, yes!
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.620]   We're gonna go buy a new vacuum.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.100]   This is amazing, okay?
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.540]   So you're worried about still being single.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.680]   That's what you got to look forward to,
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.300]   being excited when you get married about vacuums.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.060]   But I was thrilled going, like researching it
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.380]   and we got this shark thing that was just amazing
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.940]   'cause it's called Shark and it sucks everything up.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.220]   And I was so excited to get home that day
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.040]   and put that thing together and go around and vacuum
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.620]   and all to the glory of God, you know?
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.980]   And so it was just all of this stuff.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.580]   It just felt fun, but that's like the ownership mentality
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.580]   is that these goods and the spending is here for me
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.940]   to make me happy, to feed my emotions.
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.420]   But if we understand that we're stewards,
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.380]   then it's every spending decision,
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.020]   really it's a question of, all right, God,
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.660]   is this what you want me to do with your money?
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.220]   Is this going to honor you?
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.580]   So it changed our view of income.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.260]   It changed our view of spending.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.380]   Completely changed our view of debt.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.660]   When I went to college, when I left for college,
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.420]   my mom and dad gave me a credit card.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.740]   It had my name on it and everything.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.580]   Little Visa, Chase Visa card.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.740]   And they were like, had $500 on it, which was amazing.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.700]   That was so much money to me.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.300]   And they gave it to me and they said,
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.060]   "Adam, this is for emergencies."
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:13.380]   They didn't define emergency, okay?
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.180]   But it was, all I knew was it was for emergency.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.420]   So when I graduated from college,
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.320]   I somehow had $3,000 on that card
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.820]   that started off with 500, because to me,
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.560]   an emergency like debt was this tool
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.240]   to get what I wanted without waiting.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.020]   It was this tool to live one or two income levels
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.420]   above where I actually was.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.300]   And so, you know, anytime I saw an emergency,
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.580]   hey, my friends are going on spring break,
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.180]   I want to go with them, I don't have money in the bank.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.860]   Emergency, you know, swipe.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.180]   And hey, I need new basketball shoes.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.820]   Emergency, and you know, just swipe.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.260]   And it ended up with, it was just this tool.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.900]   It felt like everybody else was doing it.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.140]   That was the ownership mentality.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.820]   And then when we start to understand
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.780]   and embrace stewardship, we start to realize
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.340]   that God actually has something to say about debt.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.960]   And what he says is it's dangerous.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.760]   And it's not something to be entered into lightly.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.920]   Proverbs 22, seven says, "The rich rule over the poor."
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.640]   Listen to this emotion, like, this is emotional language.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.000]   "The rich rule over the poor,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.860]   "and the borrower is slave to the lender."
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.120]   The debt, it traps us, and that's certainly what we felt
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.740]   when we were facing that $120,000 in student loan debt.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.740]   And so it became this enormous change
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.660]   in the way that we viewed debt.
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.220]   But the category that I think it probably changed us
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:38.220]   the most was the way that we thought about generosity.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.860]   What I saw growing up when it came to generosity
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.220]   was every once in a while,
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.420]   giving money to somebody that asked.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.560]   I didn't grow up as a follower of Jesus,
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.860]   but I had one great example growing up
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.700]   that I'll never forget.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.580]   My aunt, my mom's sister, was a follower of Jesus.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.980]   And I do, I would still to this day describe my Aunt Linda
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.220]   as being one of the most generous people
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.380]   on the face of the earth.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.060]   And she was very vocal about her generosity
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.900]   or very excited to be a giver.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.900]   And to me, as like a little kid when I was watching this,
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.700]   it meant that she gave great Christmas gifts.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.720]   And when she babysat, she gave like twice as much ice cream
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.060]   as my mom would give me.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.860]   And so to me, generosity was like,
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.600]   Jesus, he gives a lot of ice cream
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.640]   and they give good Christmas gifts.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.680]   But that's basically all I saw of generosity growing up.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.500]   And so when I went to college
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.220]   and right through the middle of my college career,
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.260]   when I became a follower of Jesus,
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.060]   I just, I started to hear about this thing called generosity
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.980]   and thought, all right, this is something
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.820]   I probably should do.
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.980]   I should probably start giving.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.280]   And so I developed early on in my walk with Jesus,
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.340]   I developed what I thought was the single most generous,
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.900]   greatest generosity plan ever.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.900]   And it was this, is I would go to the ATM machine
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.020]   on a Friday night and I would get all my money out
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:54.940]   for the weekend.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.720]   And I had this agreement with God
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.480]   that anything I had left over on Sunday night,
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.940]   because I went to church on Sunday night,
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.680]   anything I had left over on Sunday night,
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.660]   I would give to him, I'd give to the church.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.660]   And so I'd put that money in my pocket
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.320]   and I'd go all Friday night, all day, Saturday,
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.100]   Saturday night, all day Sunday.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.800]   And whatever I had in my pocket,
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.300]   I'd walk into church that night
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.740]   and I'd drop that little money in there.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.100]   And most of the time it was nothing.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.820]   Oftentimes it was one or $2,
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.340]   but I will never forget the night I walked in
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.820]   and there was a $5 bill in my pocket.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.180]   And I was so nervous because up to that point,
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.260]   this I had never given away that much money.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.580]   And so I'm walking in there just going,
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.860]   is it ones or five?
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.580]   No, it's a five.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.940]   All right, did I tell anybody about this plan?
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.800]   I think, well, God knows.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.300]   All right, so I walk in there
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.700]   and I walk over to the little table
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.260]   and I'm like, huh?
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.060]   And I just kind of look around
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.620]   and I put the $5 bill in there.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.620]   And I mean, I was just kind of walked around like, yep.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.700]   That just happened, all right?
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.460]   $5, five whole dollars I just gave to God,
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.780]   you are welcome, okay?
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.000]   And thought they were gonna name the building after me
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.900]   or something like that.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.660]   And so to me, my mindset with generosity,
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.040]   which is what I think is the mindset with so many of us
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.320]   when we take an ownership mentality is this,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.780]   my mindset was live first, give leftovers.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.900]   Make sure I'm taken care of
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.600]   and then just give whatever is left over.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.520]   But if we understand that we're not owners of anything,
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.580]   but we're rather stewards of everything,
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.360]   then it flips that around and it says, no,
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.040]   your first priority is generosity
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.540]   and you live off whatever else is left over.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.940]   Here's the thing that I've noticed about generosity.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.320]   When somebody really understands stewardship,
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.980]   this is the first area
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.580]   where you see the evidence of stewardship.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:02.500]   I would go so far to say, this is the best indicator
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.060]   that you understand that you are a steward, not an owner
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.360]   is how generous you are.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.480]   There's something about generosity.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.780]   It's in the way that we're wired.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.940]   It's in the way that we're wired
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.180]   and there's something about generosity
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.740]   that what we start to realize when we understand,
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.620]   when we understand this concept
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.700]   and we understand that God in his grace and in his mercy,
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.860]   he is inviting us in,
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.940]   inviting us in to be a part of what he is doing.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.700]   His vision and values is for the needy and for the oppressed
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.100]   and for those who are slaves to their sin to be set free.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.360]   That's his vision and values.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:49.380]   And in this amazing, amazing thing, God says, guess what?
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.660]   I'm gonna entrust resources to you
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.020]   and you get to be a part of this amazing thing
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.820]   of watching, watching needs be met.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.780]   So I've got two boys, a five-year-old and a three-year-old
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.820]   and last year we were at White Rock Lake
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.700]   and we were standing by the water
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.180]   and there were some ducks around
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.260]   and this woman was there with her children
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.960]   and she was throwing out all this bread to the ducks
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.500]   and the kids, or I'm sorry,
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.620]   this woman was there with her kids
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.460]   and they were throwing out bread to the ducks.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.100]   And so my two boys, I did not plan appropriately.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.380]   I did not have any bread to give to the ducks.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.760]   And so my two boys are watching these other boys
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.780]   just have a blast, have a blast,
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.840]   just freely giving out to the ducks
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.380]   and seeing the joy that they have.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.860]   And I'm watching this situation
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.940]   just starting to feel smaller and smaller.
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.500]   Like I'm such a terrible parent
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.420]   because I didn't bring any bread for my kids to give out.
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.620]   And my boys are watching this
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.780]   and I know where this is going.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.300]   This is gonna go to like freak out
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.160]   and I'm gonna have to leave.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.500]   So I'm kind of like, all right, boys, let's go.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.820]   Yeah, it looks like they're having a blast.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.820]   And so this woman in her kindness,
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.620]   she looked at my two boys watching
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.740]   and she just took a piece of bread out
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.460]   and she just gave it to my boys and said,
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.560]   "Here, you can have some fun too."
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.500]   And then my boys sat there and they started giving it out.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.420]   And I was like, what a great picture
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.620]   of what God is doing with us.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.900]   That He is taking His bread.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.380]   I mean, He could solve all the world's problems on His own,
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.900]   but for some crazy reason, He loves to use us.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.380]   And He's inviting us into this and He's saying,
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.700]   "Hey, here's some bread.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.260]   You get to have a blast as you're generous
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.980]   and you get to go out there and help people."
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:30.900]   Here's the thing you guys will understand about generosity.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.900]   It is the most fun you will ever have with money.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.100]   That's it.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.060]   It's the most fun you will ever have.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:48.740]   And I want to show you that, not just tell you that.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.060]   And so watch this.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.560]   (congregation applauding)
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:06.340]   Don't miss this guys.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:14.460]   There is nothing that you could buy.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.900]   There is no car you could drive,
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.720]   no article of clothing that you could own.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.380]   There's no apartment that you could live in
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.380]   or home that you could buy.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.900]   There's no restaurant you could eat at.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.080]   There's no vacation that you could go on.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.500]   That when you completed that transaction,
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.540]   it would give you the satisfaction
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.000]   and the joy that generosity does.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.900]   That's what I'm looking for when I go to North Park.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.040]   That's what I'm looking for
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.760]   when I start to think about what can I buy?
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.600]   What can I buy?
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.360]   What else can I add to my life?
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.340]   I am hoping that that thing that I purchase
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.340]   is gonna provide some sort of an emotional satisfaction
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.860]   and lift and fulfillment.
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.540]   And it never ever does.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:09.780]   Because I have been wired and you have been wired
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.660]   not to be owners, but rather to be stewards.
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:19.700]   When we embrace this life and money and possessions
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.420]   and our relationship with that stuff is one of ownership,
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.980]   it leads to crisis.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.540]   It leads to crisis, it leads to discontentment,
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.660]   it leads to frustration, it leads to fear,
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.940]   it leads to anxiety.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.700]   And for every single one of us,
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.420]   the first step out of that is to understand
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.540]   that we're not owners, we're stewards.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:44.500]   So I don't know which one of the people in that video
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.140]   you identify with more.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.260]   Maybe for some of you, you identify with that,
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.980]   with the widow, with the worker.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.740]   And you feel like you're just behind
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:58.380]   and there is no hope for your situation.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.180]   And what I wanna remind you of is what that sweet lady
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:06.180]   put as her license plate, Jay Jaira, Jehovah Jaira,
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:11.460]   the name of God that is the Lord provides.
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:15.980]   So if you're in a situation that seems hopeless
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.420]   and you think God has fallen asleep at the wheel
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.900]   with your financial situation,
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.620]   I just wanna remind you that you worship the God
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.180]   of the universe who owns everything
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.340]   and that you are more important than the birds of the air
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.580]   and the flowers of the field that Jesus told us,
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.540]   if God feeds and clothes those,
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.740]   then he is going to feed and clothe you,
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.020]   he's not forgotten you.
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.620]   And maybe some of you though in this room
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.580]   feel more like the bakery owners,
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.100]   where you have been entrusted with more resources
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:52.940]   and you have an opportunity to change hundreds,
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.020]   if not thousands of lives
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.180]   with a complete and total reordering
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.740]   of your financial world.
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.220]   And if that's you, I just want to remind you
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.540]   of also what Jesus said that to whom much is given,
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.940]   much is expected and entrusted.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.600]   And with a room this size guys,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.940]   with this many people in here,
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.020]   if just a few of you,
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.180]   if just a few of you embrace the stewardship
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.420]   and flipped everything around
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.380]   and understood that you were stewards and not owners,
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.120]   I'm telling you, things will change in this city.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.860]   You guys talk about changing the world
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:27.940]   through the lives of young adults,
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.900]   I think God wants to work in and through the resources
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.180]   that he has entrusted to you.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.660]   You guys have an enormous responsibility
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.940]   and I want you to feel that pressure.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.580]   I don't want you to walk out of here tonight
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.180]   just feeling the same.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.660]   I'm just going, hey, I'm a scoreboard.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.940]   This stuff is here for me.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.660]   It's not for you.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.220]   And God in his grace and mercy,
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.900]   he's invited you in, you get to participate.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:00.800]   There's something in you that comes alive
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.620]   when you are seeking to be generous.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.620]   But the flip of that is also true.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.580]   There's something in each and every one of us
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:15.580]   that is dead if we are not embracing this stewardship.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:21.300]   So our relationship is not to be one of ownership,
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.420]   it is to be one of stewardship.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.980]   Our job is to get to know the owner
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.740]   and seek to manage those resources that he has given us,
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.100]   not according to our vision and values,
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.520]   but according to his vision and values.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.540]   Let's pray that we can do that, will you?
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.820]   (congregation murmurs)
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.420]   God, you're the owner of it all.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:47.260]   We just confess that here tonight before you.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:52.260]   You own everything.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.440]   So there is no need in this room that is too big for you.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.340]   And the resources that you have given to us are not,
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.240]   not just to make our life easier or more comfortable.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.260]   So God, as we were praying before this night started,
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.880]   change us, call us out, Lord.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:19.580]   Rattle our cages and help us, Lord,
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.760]   to see that what we've been entrusted with,
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.020]   that that can change the world.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:30.620]   God, help us to be generous
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:35.340]   because that is such a phenomenal representation
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.300]   of who Jesus is.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:40.260]   And God, we worship you for your generosity.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.540]   And thank you that you have paid a debt for all of us
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.660]   that we could not pay.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.860]   And thank you for sending your son, Jesus.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.500]   Change us, Lord.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.180]   Use us, Lord, please.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.260]   Amen.
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.100]   Amen.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:10.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
