1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
 Your lies be old me the kid my parents wanted me to be all the ways the world hurt me

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,560
 Goodbye to my fears and anxiety the reason why my ex left me rest in peace to the old me

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:35,200
 All right, well, hey welcome everybody in the room welcome all the ports live locations

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:46,200
 Greater Lafayette Indianapolis Des Moines Cincinnati Tulsa North Houston we are continuing this series RIP to the old me

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,200
 Now today is February 15th which means yesterday was Valentine's Day

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,200
 Valentine's Day means a lot of things to a lot of different people

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,200
 Let me let you into my world on Valentine's I've been married almost 10 years

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
 And so what I'm about to tell you I should have known better

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,200
 But my wife and I had a baby a couple weeks ago, and when you do that, thank you. Yes

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,200
 When that happens people generally set up a meal train which just means people will drop off food or send Uber Eats or do different things

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,200
 And my wife last week said hey on Monday Valentine's Day a friend of ours and her husband were going to drop off food

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
 Should we tell them to cancel it's Valentine's Day

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,200
 Now I thought she was being very considerate about this other couple who was married

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
 And how they shouldn't be spending Valentine's Day dropping off food to us

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,200
 We can just Uber Eats it'll be fine

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
 And I said no tell them they don't need to bring food on Valentine's Day

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,200
 The next day comes by she's like are you sure you want me to tell them you know it's Valentine's Day

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
 I'm like yeah it's Valentine's Day tell them not to bring food

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,200
 Sunday comes and she says so what are we doing tomorrow

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,200
 And I say well you said a few days ago you didn't want to do anything on Valentine's Day

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,200
 Now hold on hold on hold on

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
 Man this is really important

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,200
 No matter how many times or in how many ways they tell you I don't want to do anything on Valentine's Day

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,200
 They are sitting on a throne of lies

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
 Because they don't mean that at all

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,200
 And I said well I thought you said you didn't want to do anything

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,200
 You were like yeah but you said cancel food I assumed we were going to do something

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 And I immediately went into yeah we're going to do something for sure

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,200
 And so I come up with a plan of what we're going to do for Valentine's

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,200
 We're going to go find a patio sit outside it's going to be great

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,200
 Now what does that have to do with tonight and why do I bring that up

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 Because Valentine's Day you know is one of those days that can be a day of disappointment

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
 For some people it can be a day of excitement

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,200
 For new couples in the room that just started dating you're so thrilled that he showed up

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
 And he brought you some candies you brought some chocolates

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,200
 When you think Valentine's you may think some of the things that we grew up thinking

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,200
 Like that stuffed teddy bear that somebody dropped off your junior year in high school

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 Or flowers he had sent to work that he paid way too much to send flowers

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
 Is ten times more than to buy them at the grocery store

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
 But he sent them anyways because that's what he is

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,200
 Or maybe you think back to you know elementary school

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
 When they would hand out the most disgusting chocolate candy of all time

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,200
 I don't know what it is for you maybe for you it really is at Galentine's

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
 And you just think man I'm going to just go out with the girls

45
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,200
 And I don't even want to and I'm going to go home and replay episodes of The Bachelor

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,200
 I don't know what it is but there's a lot of different things associated with it

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,200
 Sometimes it's disappointment in fact I'm going to give some of these

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
 Who's single guys in the room right here?

49
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,200
 Any single guys? Alright bro shoot your shot man

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 You single? Alright man

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
 Another single guy

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,200
 I'm not giving away a card that's just pathetic

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
 Alright chocolates these look like gourmet chocolates

54
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,200
 Alright all you guys need to stand up right now and pick a girl

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
 And I'm just kidding by the end

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
 What if we did? Get the camera

57
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
 By the end of the night you need to give those to somebody else

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,200
 Don't eat those chocolates they're not for you or the chocolate candy

59
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,200
 But on Valentine's whether you had a great day or you had a disappointing day

60
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,200
 One thing that all of us share in common is this desire for love

61
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
 This desire to have a relationship

62
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 This desire to have a connection with someone of the opposite sex

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 That hopefully someday maybe leads us into marriage

64
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,200
 And the disappointment maybe you felt or some people do feel on Valentine's Day is one thing

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,200
 But to have a love life that ends in disappointment is an entirely other thing

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,200
 And one of the more important decisions you're going to make in this stage of life

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 Is deciding who you're going to date and then eventually for most of you

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
 Who you're going to marry

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
 And we're talking in this series about RIP to the old me

70
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
 Rest in peace to the old me

71
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
 What does that mean?

72
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
 Well the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5 verse 17

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
 That when you put your faith in Jesus

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,200
 What he did on the cross, dying for your sin, rising from the grave

75
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,200
 That moment you came to faith you became a new person

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,200
 An old you is gone and a new life has begun and was born

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
 And now as a Christian life we live out that new life

78
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,200
 So that's this whole series walking through what it looks like to live out the new life

79
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
 And live out new ways

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
 And one of the ways we're going to talk about tonight

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
 Is related to dating

82
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,200
 Specifically tonight's topic is RIP to toxic dating

83
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,200
 How to stop dating toxically

84
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:33,200
 How to say RIP, rest in peace, to toxic dating

85
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200
 And the chatter in the room only reflects the fact that a lot of us

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,200
 Have experienced some toxic dating

87
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,200
 And what I know all of us have in common

88
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,200
 Is that none of us wants to have a relationship that is dysfunctional

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
 That's toxic

90
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
 That ends in heartbreak

91
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
 And the good news is God doesn't want that for you either

92
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 And in scripture he lays out principles and teachings and instructions

93
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
 That we can learn from and apply

94
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,200
 As it relates to how we navigate the waters of dating if you will

95
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
 So tonight I want to talk about a couple ways

96
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
 That is to play itself out

97
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,200
 How to stop dating toxically

98
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,200
 And look at two observations from the life of one of the most famous men in the Old Testament

99
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
 This was a man named Samson

100
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 And Samson, when you think of his name

101
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 You guys are on another level tonight man

102
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,200
 There's generally a couple words that come to mind

103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
 And one of them is another name

104
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,200
 And it's the name of the most famous woman in his life

105
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,200
 And her name was Delilah

106
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
 Hey there Delilah

107
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
 And Delilah and his relationship

108
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,200
 Really Samson's life in general gives us some key takeaways

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,200
 About how to avoid by looking at his life and seeing what not to do

110
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,200
 Because he is an example of toxic love if you will

111
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 And so we're going to walk through some of his story

112
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,200
 And we're going to be in the book of Judges chapter 16

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
 Now the book of Judges, if you have a Bible you can flip open there

114
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
 If not it will be up on the screen

115
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,200
 And you'll get a high level overview of both Judges and Samson

116
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,200
 The book of Judges is a time where Judges were the leaders of Israel

117
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
 God would appoint a judge

118
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
 And don't think Judge Judy gown and gavel

119
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
 Think the Avengers if you will

120
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,200
 Because each of these, throughout it you've got Gideon who's like Ant-Man

121
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
 You've got Deborah who's Wonder Woman

122
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,200
 And then you've got our boy Samson who would be the Hulk

123
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,200
 And Samson is born to a couple

124
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
 Who had spent years and years and years unable to have children

125
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
 And an angel shows up to the mother, or Samson's mother

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
 And says you are going to have a baby boy

127
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
 God has heard your prayer, here's what you need to know about him

128
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
 The angel's telling her

129
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
 He will be set apart from birth

130
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
 He will be distinct from all other people in the nation

131
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
 And he will be set apart and be a Nazarite

132
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,200
 In other words he will be a part of this unique group that's taking a vow to God

133
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,200
 And in his life he is to not have any exposure or to drink any alcohol

134
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,200
 He's not to have any exposure to anything dead or dead bodies

135
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,200
 And he is to not ever cut his hair

136
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,200
 And God is going to use him to deliver the nation of Israel

137
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 And his mom is ecstatic and overjoyed

138
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
 And we're also told something else

139
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
 He's going to have superhuman strength

140
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,200
 Unlike anybody else in the Old Testament, which is why I said the Hulk

141
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,200
 But despite having this unbelievable strength

142
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,200
 Samson had a weakness for the ladies

143
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,200
 And it would be that weakness that would take this incredibly he-man

144
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
 And turn him into a picture of weakness

145
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:45,200
 And in his story we learn about the ways that toxic dating can take out an entire life

146
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,200
 As we're going to see in his journey

147
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
 Samson is a guy that has a story where we're going to pick up

148
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
 In his story is with his relationship with Delilah

149
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
 But here's what you got to know about Samson

150
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
 He's already had 20 years by this point

151
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
 Where he has not lived in accordance with who God says he was supposed to be

152
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,200
 God had given him this incredible strength and he had squandered on himself

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
 His first marriage had fallen apart

154
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
 He dated a woman that was a Philistine

155
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
 Basically like the enemies of the nation of Israel at that time

156
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
 And he said, you know what, I got a good idea

157
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
 I'm going to date one of our enemy's daughters

158
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
 He marries her and then he's not a good guy

159
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
 He's kind of a jerk, picks a fight with the Philistines

160
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
 And they pick a fight back and they kill his wife and his father-in-law

161
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
 Burn them alive

162
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,200
 And Samson just continues to pick fights with these people

163
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,200
 At one point, because he's so sexually unrestrained

164
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
 He goes and sleeps with a prostitute

165
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,200
 And he's just a picture of a wreck

166
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
 And so by the time we pick up the story with Delilah

167
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,200
 The narrator or the author is writing us to show

168
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
 A story that makes you go, this is unbelievable

169
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
 How could this happen?

170
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
 And it's because of the ways that he compromised

171
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,200
 And did not decide, I'm going to follow the ways of God

172
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
 He decided, I'm going to follow the ways of me

173
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
 I'm not going to pursue the desires of God's heart

174
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,200
 I'm going to pursue the desires of my heart

175
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 And it led to destruction

176
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,200
 So we're going to pick up in verse 4 and I'll walk through

177
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,200
 "Sometime later, he," that's Samson

178
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,200
 "Fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek

179
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 Whose name was Delilah"

180
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
 So he falls in love with a valley girl named Delilah

181
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 "Who was not among the people of God"

182
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
 That's with the valley of Sorek

183
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
 Basically another Philistine girl

184
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
 So when God said, she is not who you are to be in love with

185
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
 Or to date or to marry

186
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
 "And the rulers of the Philistines went to her"

187
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
 That's again the enemy of the people of God

188
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
 "The rulers come to her"

189
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
 The enemy of Samson

190
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 "And they said, 'See if you can lure him

191
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
 Into showing you the secret of his great strength

192
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
 And how we can overpower him

193
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,200
 So we may tie him up and subdue him

194
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
 And each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels'"

195
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,200
 So Samson at this point in the story, in chapters past

196
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
 He had, with a donkey bone jaw

197
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
 Or the bone of a donkey bone

198
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
 The bone of a donkey bone

199
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
 The bone of a donkey jaw

200
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
 Had just killed a thousand Philistines

201
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
 So these guys are getting tired and fed up

202
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
 Of this one guy with supernatural power

203
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
 And supernatural strength

204
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
 And they finally go to his girlfriend now at the time

205
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
 And say, "We will give you eleven hundred shekels each"

206
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
 There's five of them

207
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
 "What's that equivalent to today?"

208
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,200
 Between fifteen and thirty million dollars

209
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 They basically say, "We will give you enough money

210
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
 To retire for the rest of your life

211
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
 To get the house

212
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
 You will be good

213
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,200
 If you can find out how we can lure and trap Samson"

214
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
 So Delilah is a gold digger

215
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
 Probably the earliest example of a gold digger

216
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,200
 And she says, then to Samson

217
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
 After agreeing to do it

218
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 "Tell me the secret of your great strength

219
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
 How can you be tied up and subdued?"

220
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
 And Samson answers her

221
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
 At this point you've got to think

222
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
 Bro, what are you thinking?

223
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
 She just said, "Hey, you know, hypothetically

224
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,200
 If someone's going to try to kill you

225
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
 But he's in love

226
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
 And what happens when you're in love

227
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
 It doesn't matter what they say

228
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
 You make excuses, you justify it

229
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
 He's doing what you do whenever you're in love

230
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
 You allow the other person more rope

231
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
 Than they really should have

232
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
 Because you can't see clearly

233
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
 You're in love, it's what love does

234
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
 And Samson doesn't give her the right answer

235
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
 He makes up a lie and he says

236
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 "If anyone ties me with seven fresh bow strings

237
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
 That have not been dried

238
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
 I will become as weak as any other man"

239
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
 Now why he made this up, we're not really told

240
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
 But he basically makes up something and says

241
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 "If anybody ties me up, I'll become as weak"

242
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
 So then the rulers of the Philistines

243
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
 Brought her seven fresh bow strings

244
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
 That had not been tied

245
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
 With men hidden in his room

246
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
 He goes to sleep

247
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
 And while he's lying there on the bed

248
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
 She ties him up

249
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
 And then she said

250
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
 "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!"

251
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
 And he got out of bed

252
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
 And he snapped the bow strings

253
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,200
 As if a string snaps when it comes close to a flame

254
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
 We've all been there before, right?

255
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
 So the secret of his strength

256
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
 Was not discovered

257
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
 Then Delilah said to Samson

258
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
 "You've made a fool of me

259
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
 You lied to me

260
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
 Come now, tell me how you can be tied"

261
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,200
 And so he answers her again

262
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
 Gives her another answer

263
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
 Next night comes, he goes to bed

264
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
 Because he's sleeping and staying at her house

265
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
 And he basically says

266
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
 "No, you actually got to tie me up with new ropes"

267
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
 And so he goes to sleep

268
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
 And she ties him up with new ropes

269
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
 And then she comes in and says

270
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
 "Samson, the Philistines are here!"

271
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
 And he jumps out of bed

272
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
 And again, he breaks it and snaps it

273
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
 Like it was nothing

274
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
 And then she says again

275
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
 "Man, you've made a fool of me

276
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
 How can you do this?"

277
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
 And he says

278
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
 "You know what it is?

279
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
 You've got to weave my hair

280
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
 You've got to put my hair in a weave

281
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
 And that will make me as weak as any other man"

282
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
 And of course he's lying to her again

283
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
 And she does it

284
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
 And you read the story and you're like

285
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
 "This is the most...

286
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 How at some point, Samson, did you not stop and go

287
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
 'Wait a second

288
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
 Every time I go to bed

289
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,200
 You keep doing the thing that I said was the thing

290
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
 That would make me be able to be subdued'?"

291
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
 But when you think about it

292
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
 It's not that far off

293
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
 From what some of us

294
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
 If others were looking at our story would say

295
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
 "Wait a second!

296
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
 You guys, he treated you so poorly

297
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,200
 And you're dating again?

298
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,200
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

299
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
 After she cheated on you

300
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 You guys are back together?

301
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
 After all the different times that she lied

302
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 And you had his phone

303
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
 And he was like texting that other girl

304
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
 And it wasn't like just

305
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
 "Hey, are you done with that assignment yet?"

306
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
 I mean

307
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
 And as easy as it is to see with Samson

308
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
 Some of us

309
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
 If people could look into our life

310
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
 They would go

311
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
 "How did you find yourself there?"

312
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
 And this is why love is such an important topic

313
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
 Because it does something to the heart

314
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
 You can fall in love with someone that doesn't have character

315
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
 That doesn't have your faith

316
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
 That can lead you away from God

317
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
 And that's exactly where Samson is

318
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
 And he lies to her again

319
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
 And he wakes up

320
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
 The weave doesn't work

321
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
 And he breaks free

322
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
 And then she says this

323
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 She goes full scale manipulation Mary right here

324
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
 She says

325
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,200
 "How can you say I love you

326
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
 When you don't confide in me?

327
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,200
 This is the third time you've made a fool of me

328
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,200
 And haven't told me the secret of your great strength"

329
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
 With such nagging

330
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
 That's in the Bible

331
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
 She prodded him

332
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
 Day after day

333
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
 Until he was sick to death of it

334
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,200
 So it becomes all that they talk about

335
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,200
 So the sex wasn't working to get the secret out of him

336
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
 So now she just nags

337
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
 And every time he comes home

338
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
 She's just weeping about

339
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
 "You still won't tell me the secret"

340
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
 And then when he goes off to work

341
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
 Or he comes back

342
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
 She's still sitting there in sackcloth and ashes

343
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,200
 And just moping

344
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
 And eventually Samson

345
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
 It says he goes

346
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
 "Oh this is driving me insane

347
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
 I'll just tell you already"

348
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
 And so he told her everything

349
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,200
 "No razor has ever been used on my head

350
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
 Because I have been a Nazarite

351
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
 Dedicated to God

352
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
 From my mother's womb

353
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
 I was born a special child

354
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,200
 And God had a special purpose and plan for my life"

355
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
 I wonder if when he's saying this to this woman

356
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,200
 Who's a woman he wasn't supposed to be in a relationship with

357
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
 A woman that he's sexually immoral with

358
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,200
 I wonder if any of it's flashing through his mind

359
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,200
 "Oh yeah, an angel showed up at my birth

360
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
 God had a purpose

361
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
 And his hand on me

362
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,200
 From before I was even born

363
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
 And I've used it and squandered it

364
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
 To pursue my pleasure

365
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,200
 Not my purpose"

366
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
 He says

367
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
 "I've never had a haircut my entire life

368
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
 And if my head was shaved

369
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
 My strength would leave me

370
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,200
 And I would be as weak as any other man

371
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,200
 When Delilah saw he had told her everything

372
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
 She sent word to the rulers of the Philistines

373
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
 Come back once more

374
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 He's told me everything

375
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
 So the rulers of the Philistines

376
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
 Returned with silver in their hands

377
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,200
 After putting him to sleep on her lap"

378
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 This girl is poison

379
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
 "She called for someone to shave off

380
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,200
 The seven braids of his hair

381
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,200
 And so began to subdue him

382
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,200
 And his strength left him

383
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
 Then she called, 'Samson, the Philistines are upon you'

384
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
 He awoke from sleep and thought

385
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
 'I'll go out as before

386
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
 Shake myself free'

387
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
 But he did not know

388
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,200
 The Lord had left him

389
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,200
 Then the Philistines seized him

390
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
 And they gouged out his eyes

391
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
 And they took him down to Gaza"

392
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
 Just another city

393
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
 "They bound him with bronze shackles

394
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,200
 And they set him to grinding grain in the prison

395
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
 But the hair on his head

396
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
 Began to grow again

397
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
 After it had been shaved"

398
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
 We're going to come back to that verse

399
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
 I mean, this is a tragic story

400
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
 And it's meant to be a tragic story

401
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
 You think about Samson in that moment

402
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
 It would have to be the worst day of his life

403
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
 As he's bound up, as he realizes

404
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
 After living his whole life

405
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,200
 With unbelievable strength

406
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
 That the spirit of God was no longer

407
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
 Rippling through his body

408
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
 And he was as weak as any other man

409
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
 And maybe one of the last sights that he saw

410
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,200
 Was Delilah before they gouged his eyes out

411
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
 And he passed out and he woke up shackled

412
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
 And realized, it's not just dark in here

413
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
 I can't see

414
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
 My eyes are gone

415
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,200
 And this man who had such incredible strength

416
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,200
 That weakness would lead to his downfall

417
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,200
 And I think God has you here tonight

418
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
 Because he does not want

419
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
 The train wreck of the romantic life that Samson had

420
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
 And some of the things that he engaged in

421
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,200
 To be a part of your story

422
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
 And lead to a train wreck in your life

423
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
 And there's two things that I really want to pull out

424
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
 And camp on

425
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
 Because they just make up a simple component

426
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,200
 Of what it looks like to stop dating toxically

427
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
 And we see it

428
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
 And it's easy to see from the outset

429
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
 But the first thing I want to talk about

430
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
 Is stop dating the wrong people

431
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
 Stop dating the wrong people

432
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
 Now how do I know if they're the wrong person?

433
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
 Because nobody in here is like

434
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
 You know what, I like dating the wrong person

435
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
 Everyone's looking for Mr. Right or Mrs. Right

436
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
 One of the ways we see from the story

437
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
 Is don't date toxic people

438
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
 No matter how beautiful

439
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
 No matter how amazing

440
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,200
 Or how much relational or emotional equity you have

441
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
 If they have toxic traits

442
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
 You have a toxic relationship

443
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,200
 And candidly, if you're attracted to someone with toxic traits

444
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
 You've got some toxic traits you need to work on yourself

445
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
 Inside of the story we see Samson

446
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
 I mean look at some of the traits that he has

447
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
 He's selfish

448
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
 He's using her

449
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
 And sleeping with her

450
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
 He's impulsive

451
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
 And he's just raffling off

452
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
 Just oh you should do this, you should do this

453
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
 He's, honestly he's dumb

454
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
 He's so drunk in love that he can't see straight

455
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
 He's angry

456
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
 We're told earlier that because he basically picked a fight

457
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
 Or he lost a riddle

458
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
 Samson liked to play games

459
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
 Another negative quality

460
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,200
 He played a riddle that he basically lost with the Philistines

461
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 And in a temper tantrum

462
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,200
 He goes and kills 30 guys to pay for his bet

463
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
 He eventually gets so angry

464
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 That he catches these foxes and sets fire

465
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
 To this farmland of a Philistine person

466
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
 And he just deals with an anger problem

467
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
 And this is really important girls

468
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
 Because there's something broken candidly

469
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
 And I want, as gently as I can say that

470
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
 He's attracted to the bad boy

471
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
 And if you pursue a dating relationship

472
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
 Or marry a bad boy

473
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
 You are making a bad decision

474
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
 Because they end up being someone

475
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
 Whose character and that temper

476
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
 That doesn't become fun at 3 in the morning

477
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
 When you've got two kids crying

478
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
 Whenever you're walking through financial challenges

479
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
 Which are just a part of life

480
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
 Or a spouse that is sick

481
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
 Somebody having a temper and anger problem

482
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
 Is not something that you want

483
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
 And Samson's clearly got other issues

484
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
 He's arrogant

485
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
 I mean he thinks nobody can stop me

486
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
 Even if I tell her there's nothing that she can do

487
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
 I'm Samson

488
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
 He's sexually immoral

489
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
 He's sleeping at her house

490
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
 Previous chapter he slept with a prostitute

491
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
 And candidly he's got a fake faith

492
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
 I mean he was born and destined

493
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,200
 To be a leader and deliverer of Israel

494
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
 This is equivalent of the guy who says he's a Christian

495
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
 But doesn't act Christ-like

496
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
 And let me say, and now I'm about to go to the girls

497
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
 With the qualities of Delilah

498
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
 There are a lot of guys in this room

499
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
 That say they're a Christian

500
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
 And they do not act Christ-like

501
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
 And you should not date them

502
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
 And you should be cautious

503
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
 Because they've got a Bible and they go to the porch

504
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
 Does not mean they're not a wolf

505
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
 And if we find a wolf we will expose them

506
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
 And we will do everything we can to make sure

507
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,200
 That everyone is in a safe environment

508
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
 Because we care deeply about that

509
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
 So if you are a wolf you should know

510
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
 You are going to be exposed

511
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
 And you will not be welcome

512
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
 But we will care for you in other ways

513
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
 But Samson's a guy who claims to be a Christian

514
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
 But he doesn't act Christ-like

515
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
 I mean he's not even supposed to be dating this girl

516
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 He's not supposed to be picking fights

517
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
 That's not how you resolve conflict

518
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
 And then her, you get to her toxic traits

519
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
 And in some ways it's almost like they were made for each other

520
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
 Because you think about what she was

521
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
 She's controlling, she's manipulative

522
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
 You said you love me

523
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
 How dare you

524
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
 I mean she's

525
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
 Using her body to manipulate

526
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
 To control

527
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
 She's a gold digger

528
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
 She's selfish

529
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
 She doesn't care about him

530
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
 She cares about the money that she will get

531
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
 She's sexually immoral

532
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
 She's sleeping over at her house

533
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
 He falls asleep on her nap

534
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
 My guess is he didn't just fall asleep

535
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
 After having a cup of coffee

536
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
 Something else probably

537
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
 She's dishonest

538
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 And she's not a woman of God

539
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
 And by that I mean

540
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
 She was not a part of the people of God

541
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
 God had commanded, which brings us to another

542
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
 How I know they're not the right person

543
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
 She was not a part of the group of people

544
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
 God said, hey these are the only people

545
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
 That are eligible bachelors and bachelorettes

546
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
 For my people

547
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
 Among the nation of Israel you were to marry the people of God

548
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
 Because if you marry foreign women you're going to go after foreign gods

549
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
 And I want you to worship the one true God

550
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
 And raise kids in a home where they worship the one true God

551
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
 The same is true today

552
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
 If you're a follower of Jesus

553
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
 He has made abundantly clear in scripture

554
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
 You are only to date Christians

555
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
 Did you know since 2010

556
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
 Four out of ten marriages have been between people

557
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
 Of different religions

558
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
 Many of them Christians

559
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
 Marrying someone who doesn't have a faith

560
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
 Or Mormon or marrying someone who's Buddhist

561
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
 Or marrying someone who's Islamic

562
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
 And God over and over says

563
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
 If you're following Jesus you are not to marry anyone outside

564
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
 Of those who love Jesus

565
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
 Not claim to be a Christian

566
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
 Not were raised Catholic

567
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 Not go to church sometimes

568
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
 But they love Jesus

569
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
 Let me give you the verse

570
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
 Some of you guys write this down

571
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
 Because this makes it abundantly clear

572
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
 Here is who's in bounds and who's not

573
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
 First Corinthians chapter 7 verse 39

574
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
 They are free to marry anyone they wish

575
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
 But only

576
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
 If they love the Lord

577
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
 If they love the Lord

578
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
 How do I know if they love the Lord

579
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
 How do you know if they love anything as we said before

580
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
 How do you know if somebody loves a cowboy

581
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
 Well they have season tickets

582
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
 They're wearing the jersey

583
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
 They know Dax stats

584
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
 They're constantly making sacrifices

585
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
 In order to know all that's going on

586
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
 Because why do they love it

587
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
 How do you know if somebody loves shopping

588
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
 Or loves clothes

589
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
 Well they're constantly budgeting for it

590
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
 Or maybe they're not budgeting for it

591
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
 And that's a reflection of kind of their life in general

592
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
 They're constantly in new different outfits

593
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
 They're willing to make sacrifices of their time

594
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
 Their money themselves

595
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
 So they're around you

596
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
 And they talk about it

597
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
 They make sacrifices with their time

598
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
 You call them to do something and they say

599
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
 I can't I've actually got this discipleship group

600
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
 I've actually got this ministry thing that I'm taking a part of

601
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
 If that's not happening

602
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
 You should probably double click

603
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
 And Paul says

604
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
 Only if they love Jesus

605
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
 Are they an eligible person to date

606
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
 In second Corinthians 6 he says the same thing

607
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
 In other words do not be joined together with unbelievers

608
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
 For what are righteousness and wickedness have in common

609
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
 What fellowship can light have with darkness

610
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
 Let me give you three quick reasons

611
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
 This is really important

612
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
 Number one if you marry someone who doesn't have your same faith

613
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
 Three things are going to happen

614
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
 Or at least a couple of these two things

615
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
 Two of the three are for sure going to happen

616
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
 Either they are going to cap your intimacy with Jesus

617
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
 Because they're not going to be pulling you to be involved at church

618
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
 They're not going to be encouraging you to spend time in God's word

619
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
 They don't believe in that

620
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
 Or

621
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
 They're going to be pulling you to be involved in the church

622
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
 They're not going to be encouraging you to spend time in God's word

623
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
 Or

624
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
 It's going to cap your intimacy with them

625
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
 Why would I say that

626
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
 The most intimate thing about you is what you believe

627
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
 About God

628
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
 About Jesus and the fact that you can't share that

629
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
 With the person you share a bed with

630
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
 And you make kids with

631
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
 You don't think that's going to be a barrier

632
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
 Which brings me to

633
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
 One of the dangers for your children's sake

634
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
 I mean some of you guys were raised in homes

635
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
 Where you were a part of families

636
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
 Where they got married and she was Jewish

637
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
 And he was Baptist or whatever the scenario was

638
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
 And it just created

639
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
 You know what a lot of people experience

640
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
 I experienced with my friend Sam who had parents

641
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
 That were Jewish and Baptist and he was like

642
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
 So basically I was confused

643
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
 Because neither of them really believed

644
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
 And that's where you're going to communicate

645
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
 How are you going to make decisions on raising kids

646
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
 When you're going to say as a Christian

647
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
 Man God's word is going to inform us

648
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
 But they don't believe God's word

649
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
 And the third thing is

650
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
 Not even from the Bible it's from sociology

651
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
 But from the world according to studies

652
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
 It makes you three times more likely to divorce

653
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
 Than marrying someone with the same faith

654
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
 Let me say that three times

655
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
 More likely to divorce

656
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
 There was a study done in 2001 of 35,000

657
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
 Participants of mixed religion marriages

658
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
 And found three times more likely

659
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
 Divorce is to take place

660
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
 From the American Religious

661
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
 Identification Survey

662
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
 That's 75% of religious

663
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
 Intermixed marriages end in divorce

664
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
 And God

665
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
 Who loves you as much as you love him

666
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
 And you care about him and he's a work in progress

667
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
 Or she's a work in progress, she's smoking hot

668
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
 Would say if he doesn't have your faith

669
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
 You are living in direct disobedience

670
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
 If you're dating him

671
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
 Or if you're dating her

672
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
 And candidly

673
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
 You are watering down

674
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
 What following Jesus looks like

675
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
 To someone who doesn't understand it

676
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
 Finally

677
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
 What we also see

678
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
 Actually

679
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
 There was a study done

680
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
 An experiment

681
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
 It was done in the 1990s

682
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
 In India

683
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
 It was an attempt to increase the breeding

684
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
 Of Asiatic lions

685
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
 Now because most of us don't spend a lot of time

686
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
 Studying Asiatic lions

687
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
 There are two primary types of lions

688
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
 Those are African lions which is you know Mufasa

689
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
 And then there's the Asiatic lions

690
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
 And they have some subtle differences

691
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
 What you may not know is Asiatic lions

692
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
 That's in Asia are highly endangered

693
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
 And because there are only about

694
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
 300 of them left they attempted to take

695
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
 African lions and breed them with Asiatic lions

696
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
 Hoping this will make

697
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
 You know a hybrid that will increase

698
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
 The likelihood of the species surviving

699
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
 Only something

700
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
 Terrible happened

701
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
 They took these two lions and they made a hybrid

702
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
 And it was

703
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
 Catastrophic

704
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
 About 70 lions were produced as offspring

705
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
 And

706
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
 They were so

707
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
 Immune deficient for whatever reason

708
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
 They could barely eat

709
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
 The hind legs

710
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
 Of the new hybrid lions weren't strong

711
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
 Enough to hold up the lions

712
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
 And so these 70 lions they were described as just

713
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
 Waiting to die some of them were so weak

714
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
 They couldn't eat meat off the bone they had to be fed

715
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
 Meat without a bone

716
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
 Here's a picture of them and they're basically

717
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
 The last of them are dying off because

718
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
 They're so

719
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
 Sick

720
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
 Unhealthy

721
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
 Broken

722
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
 And what was a hope of oh this will be great

723
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
 And this will work out and it will be okay

724
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
 Was anything but okay

725
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
 And that's a picture

726
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
 Of what happens often when our faith

727
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
 When we marry and merge

728
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
 Together with someone who doesn't share our faith

729
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
 Doesn't share our beliefs

730
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
 Doesn't lead to a flourishing healthy life

731
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
 It leads to dysfunction, brokenness

732
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
 Lack of life

733
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
 And God loves you He doesn't want that for you

734
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
 So the first way we stop toxic dating

735
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
 Is by saying no to the wrong people

736
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
 And saying yes to God's people

737
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
 I wish I could go another 20 minutes about that point

738
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
 But I don't have time. Number two

739
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
 Stop dating the wrong way

740
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
 In this we see toxic love we see here's the relationship

741
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
 That they have together they're sleeping together

742
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
 They're playing married

743
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
 Where he's staying over at her house

744
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
 They're using each other they're lying to each other

745
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
 They're compromising for each other

746
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
 They're pulling each other away from God

747
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
 And they're dating in isolation

748
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
 And I always say sex could be a bad thing

749
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
 And let me just

750
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
 God invented sex we've talked so much about that

751
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
 Why would God in 1 Corinthians 6

752
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
 Say flee sexual morality

753
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
 Don't do what Samson and Delilah did

754
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
 Don't allow that to be a part of your relationship

755
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
 Is it because he's against sex

756
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
 No he created it but he knows

757
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
 Outside of the context of marriage

758
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
 It brings scars and pain into your life

759
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
 Into my life

760
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
 1 Corinthians 6 says flee sexual morality

761
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
 Every other sin a person commits

762
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
 Against their own body whoever sins sexually

763
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
 Sins against their own body

764
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
 Do you not know your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit

765
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
 Who's in you

766
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
 You were bought with a price

767
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
 You are not your own honor God with your bodies

768
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
 God

769
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
 Says you are so valuable Christ would give

770
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
 His life for you

771
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
 Don't give that away

772
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
 Cheaply

773
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
 Sex was not meant to be

774
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
 An appetizer I mean

775
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
 Was meant to be dessert not an appetizer

776
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
 And you know what happens

777
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
 If you make it an appetizer

778
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
 The person you're with

779
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
 Is going to be less likely to stick around

780
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
 For the main course

781
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
 Which is marriage

782
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
 And you're so much more valuable than that

783
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
 And you're going to bring into your life

784
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 All kinds of pain and scars

785
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
 Some of the deepest pains any of us carry or I carry

786
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
 Are connected to sexual history

787
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
 Pornography

788
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
 I was reading a book a couple years ago

789
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
 And it was about sharks and the mating patterns

790
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
 Of sharks

791
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
 Which is pretty random

792
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
 And it described how when a male shark

793
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
 Mates with a female

794
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
 It bites onto them

795
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
 It's how they hold on and grip

796
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
 And so you can tell the sexual history

797
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
 Of a female shark based on the scars

798
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
 That they have on the outside

799
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
 So much so that a female shark has twice the thickness

800
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
 Of skin of a male shark

801
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
 And it described how for sharks

802
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
 Scars reflect sex

803
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
 But that's not really just true with sharks

804
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
 It's true for all of us

805
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
 For many of us

806
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
 The deepest scars we carry are connected to sex

807
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
 Sexual pain

808
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
 Or sexual abuse

809
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
 Something that happens

810
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
 A friend who was sexually abused by a family member

811
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
 It's a scar

812
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
 A family that disintegrated after a dad's sexual sin came out

813
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
 Scar

814
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
 A friend who got pregnant

815
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
 After casually hooking up with a guy

816
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
 And she got an abortion

817
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
 Because I'm not going to marry him

818
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
 Every year on that anniversary

819
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
 She weeps

820
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
 Scar

821
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
 A person who was like me

822
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
 Exposed to pornography at 12

823
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
 That led to 10 years of addiction to pornography

824
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
 Scar

825
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
 And God is so crazy about you

826
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
 He would give his life for you

827
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
 He's not opposed to sex

828
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
 He's opposed to scars

829
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
 And you experiencing the fullness and the gift

830
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
 That he intended sex to be in the car

831
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
 And you experiencing the fullness and the gift

832
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
 That he intended sex to be in the context of marriage

833
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
 A gift that Samson

834
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
 And Delilah never got to experience

835
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,200
 Finally dating in isolation

836
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
 We're never told of anyone else being in their life

837
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,200
 It's only Samson and Delilah

838
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
 In fact the whole story, Samson lives in isolation

839
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
 If you're dating in isolation

840
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
 You're going to experience dating not God's way

841
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
 Because you're dating in a way that

842
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
 God says you're really not supposed to live life

843
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
 As Christians

844
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
 We're to have other people speak into our life

845
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
 To help see those blind spots

846
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
 See the things that

847
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
 When you read Samson's story you see them all

848
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
 And if somebody was to read your story

849
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
 They'd see them all

850
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
 But we can just be so blinded by

851
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
 The love and the

852
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
 Emotional connection we feel with that person

853
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
 God says you're to have people in your life

854
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
 That come alongside and encourage

855
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
 And ask hard questions and they pray for you

856
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
 And they challenge you

857
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
 And they support and care for you

858
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
 Proverbs 18 verse 1 says

859
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
 Whoever isolates themselves

860
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
 Seeks their own desires

861
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
 And they break out or they push back

862
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
 Against all sound decision making

863
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,200
 You and I are to date with other people in our life

864
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,200
 Honoring each other and pursuing purity sexually

865
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,200
 Honoring the marriage bed and not living together and moving in together

866
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,200
 And Samson and Delilah tragically give us a picture

867
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
 Of what happens

868
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
 When we decide I'm not going to pursue God's way

869
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
 I'm going to pursue my way

870
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,200
 Now I said at the end

871
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,200
 Samson

872
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
 His hair begins to grow again

873
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
 And we're told that something else

874
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
 Begins to happen soon

875
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
 He's sitting in that dungeon and he's blind

876
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
 And he can't see

877
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
 But

878
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
 He's about to turn to God and pray

879
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
 And it's the only time

880
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
 This is crazy

881
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
 It's the only time we're told Samson ever prays

882
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
 That he ever talks to God

883
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
 Somehow the blindness physically

884
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
 Led to sight spiritually

885
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
 For the first time

886
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,200
 And sitting in that dungeon

887
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
 His hair began to grow back

888
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
 And they are having a party

889
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
 And remember he's under the arrest of the Philistines

890
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
 And he's in that dungeon

891
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
 And they're having this big kegger basically

892
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
 And there's three thousand people around

893
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
 And in the party the Philistines are like

894
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
 You know what would be awesome? Let's bring out Samson

895
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
 You know Samson that guy who like killed all those people

896
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
 Like our enemy

897
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
 We captured him bring him out

898
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
 Let's have him perform

899
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
 And it says that they were in high spirits

900
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
 Verse 25

901
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
 And they shouted bring out Samson to entertain us

902
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
 So they called Samson out of the prison

903
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
 And he performed for them

904
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,200
 Verse 26

905
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
 And Samson who held his hand

906
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
 Put me where I can feel the pillars

907
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
 That support the temple

908
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
 So that I may lean against them

909
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,200
 Now the temple was crowded with men and women

910
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
 And the rulers of the Philistines were there

911
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
 And on the roof was three thousand men and women

912
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
 Watching Samson

913
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
 And Samson prayed

914
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,200
 Sovereign Lord

915
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
 Remember me

916
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
 Please God give me strength

917
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
 Just once more and let me

918
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
 With one blow get revenge on the Philistine

919
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
 For my two eyes

920
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
 Then he reached towards

921
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
 The two central pillars

922
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
 On which the temple stood

923
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
 Bracing himself against them

924
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
 His right on one his left on the other

925
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
 He said let me die with the Philistines

926
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
 And he pushed with all of his might

927
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
 And down came the temple

928
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
 And all the rulers and the people

929
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
 Thus he killed more when he died

930
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
 Than while he lived

931
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
 Verse 31 says he had led Israel

932
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
 For twenty years

933
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,200
 Despite having chosen rebellion for years and years

934
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
 His story wasn't done

935
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
 And he turned to God

936
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
 And God honored that reflection

937
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
 And that repentance

938
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
 Even at the end

939
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
 And he walked through them

940
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
 My hope

941
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
 Is that you don't spend twenty years

942
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
 Like Samson and find yourself at forty six

943
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
 Or forty eight or forty nine

944
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
 Going what did I do?

945
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
 I just spent the last two decades

946
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
 Living how I wanted to

947
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
 Pursuing what I wanted to

948
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
 And you decide what Samson didn't decide early in his life

949
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
 Eventually he got himself there

950
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
 You decide God I'm going to trust you

951
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
 I'm not going to decide to follow the ways of the world

952
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
 I'm going to follow the ways of God's word

953
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
 And I'm going to actually date and pursue

954
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
 The type of person you invite

955
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
 And you tell me to look for

956
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
 I'm not going to go from relationship to relationship

957
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
 And one night stands

958
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
 And I'm also not going to buy the lie that God is done with you

959
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
 Because he's not done with you

960
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
 As damaged of goods as you feel like you are right now

961
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
 Because some of you do

962
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
 And you hear a godly guy or godly girl

963
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,200
 And you think there's no way a godly guy is ever going to want me

964
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
 You have bought a lie

965
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
 And the invitation to you is the invitation to anybody in this room

966
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
 You've got to surrender

967
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
 And do what the Bible calls repentance

968
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
 Relationally repent

969
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
 God I'm not going to drive myself

970
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
 I'm giving you the keys to my love life

971
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
 My married life

972
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
 I'm going to trust you

973
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
 I'm not going to date in isolation

974
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
 If I'm having sex right now

975
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
 I'm going to make the decision

976
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,200
 I'm getting out of this relationship

977
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
 It's going to be painful, it's going to be hard

978
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
 But I'm going to trust you God

979
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
 I'm going to take the steps to be the type of person that Samson wasn't

980
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
 I'm going to be a godly spouse

981
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
 I'm going to focus on finding a godly spouse

982
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
 And do so in a godly way

983
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,200
 And not end up

984
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
 After 20 years

985
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
 Coming to the place where Samson

986
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
 Through all the pain and humiliation did

987
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
 And God loves you

988
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
 And wants you to experience that

989
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
 And let me close

990
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
 Valentine's, you know I opened with it

991
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
 And I'm laying on the plane here

992
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
 Valentine's is a really interesting holiday

993
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
 Because it's a holiday that has been around for

994
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
 1400 years

995
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
 1600 years, since the 400's

996
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
 It was instituted in celebration

997
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
 Or commemoration of

998
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
 St. Valentinius, a pastor

999
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
 A priest from the first century, St. Valentin

1000
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
 He was a pastor

1001
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
 That in 268 AD decided

1002
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
 I am going to willfully reject

1003
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
 The law, what was the law?

1004
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
 Well the emperor was not a believer, not a Christian

1005
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
 His name was Claudius and he instituted

1006
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
 That men

1007
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
 Or marriage is now outlawed

1008
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
 Why would he do that? Because there was an

1009
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
 Exemption that if you were a man and you were married

1010
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
 You could be exempt from serving in the army

1011
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
 And he wanted to have an incredibly successful military

1012
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
 So he said marriage is outlawed

1013
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
 Sex, encouraged, orgies, encouraged

1014
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
 Prostitution, encouraged, sleep with whoever

1015
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
 You want, encouraged

1016
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
 But no marriage

1017
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
 Now this created a real problem for Christians

1018
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
 This growing group

1019
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
 Who said we are called to honor God

1020
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
 No matter what an emperor says, we're not called to sleep with

1021
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
 And have sex with and do what we want

1022
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
 But to honor God

1023
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
 And a pastor named Valentine

1024
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
 Said I am going to

1025
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
 Marry Christians

1026
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
 And get married

1027
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
 And so he did for years

1028
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
 And eventually he was caught, taken before Rome

1029
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
 And executed

1030
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
 Beheaded and to this day

1031
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
 And that was on February 14th, 2069

1032
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
 To this day we celebrate that

1033
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
 Now what does that have to do with you in this life?

1034
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
 In that same example

1035
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
 This is a guy who is saying I want to see

1036
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
 Godly Christian couples come together

1037
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
 And marry and there is an enemy

1038
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
 That is trying to stop and prevent that from happening

1039
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
 You came in tonight and there is an

1040
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
 Enemy that is trying to stop and prevent

1041
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
 Godly Christian couples from

1042
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
 Coming together and he is going to sell you lies

1043
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
 Like that guy doesn't know what he is talking about

1044
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
 And sure we can sleep together but we are married in God's eyes

1045
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
 And look it is not that big of a deal if no one

1046
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
 Knows our relationship and no one supports it

1047
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
 And all of that is a lie from an enemy

1048
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
 Who doesn't want godly couples to come together

1049
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
 He doesn't want Christian marriages that flourish

1050
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
 He doesn't want generations of babies raised to be

1051
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
 Discipled where men and women come together

1052
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
 And they say I am going to live for Jesus

1053
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
 In my home with my marriage

1054
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
 I am going to honor them and love them before myself

1055
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
 And I am going to pursue Christ

1056
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
 With my spouse

1057
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
 He wants anything but that to happen

1058
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
 And you are going to leave here tonight and you are going to be bombarded

1059
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
 With all of the different ways that everything I said is so

1060
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
 Unpractical because there is an enemy

1061
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
 And Jesus like Valentine wants you to

1062
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
 Experience the incredible gift of marriage

1063
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
 And the covenant

1064
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
 Of you and that other person

1065
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
 Who loved Jesus coming together

1066
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
 And being a picture to the world

1067
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
 Of what marriage is about

1068
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
 Which is god's

1069
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
 Unending love for his bride

1070
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
 The church that he gave his life for

1071
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
 On a cross

1072
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
 Let me pray

1073
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
 Father I pray

1074
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
 That you would protect

1075
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
 Men and women in here

1076
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
 Who genuinely

1077
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
 Want to honor you

1078
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
 With their dating

1079
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
 Their sexuality, their life

1080
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
 I pray that you would form marriages

1081
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
 Among couples here

1082
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
 I was listening in different locations

1083
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
 Around the country

1084
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
 And godly spouses would come together

1085
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
 And they wouldn't be perfect

1086
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
 People but they would worship a perfect god

1087
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
 And they would pursue

1088
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
 You together

1089
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
 I pray that you would stop

1090
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
 Relationships that are right now in the room that need to be stopped

1091
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
 And need to be broken up

1092
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
 Not because you want any more pain in their life

1093
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
 But because you love them and want to prevent

1094
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
 Pain

1095
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
 I pray that you would heal

1096
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
 Some of the scars that we carry

1097
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
 From pain, sexual pain

1098
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
 Sexual experience

1099
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
 And you would take our lives

1100
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
 And use them

1101
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
 For your glory

1102
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
 And it wouldn't take getting to the end

1103
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
 And all the pain that Samson went through

1104
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
 But you would take us right now

1105
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
 And move our hearts towards yours

1106
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
 We would live lives

1107
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
 Surrendered to you

1108
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
 We worship you now in song

1109
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,880
 Amen.
