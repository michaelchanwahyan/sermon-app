[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I've been tried and you know I've been tested
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   I won't back down, I won't surrender
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   I've seen the proof, I know the truth
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   This is what I was made to do
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   I was born for this
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I was born for this
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Alright Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Yeah!
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   It is awesome to be with you and our friends watching online
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   It's the second week of North Dallas Porch up there in the Frisco area
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   How about that? Way to go!
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   We're glad you guys are up there gathering
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Welcome, welcome, welcome
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   About 19 other Porch locations around the world
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And we are so glad you're jumping in online
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And I am glad to be here in Dallas with you all this summer
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   We are talking about Jesus Walks
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   This is an amazing privilege to get to talk about this little series tonight
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Because I get to introduce you to a friend
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   There's really nothing better than you can do than to share friends
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I can remember I was going through a time in my life
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Where kind of my core friend group was radically changing
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I was not yet a believer
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I was not yet somebody that was in any way walking with Jesus
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   But I had made a decision that I wanted to be an athlete
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And in my day and age, at the time I didn't think athletes were some people that were doing drugs and a lot of other things
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And so, especially being a guy that was late developing
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   As I was fighting for spots and opportunities to play for a long time
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   In different fields of competition
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I just decided I wasn't going to go a certain direction
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And I had no problem with some of my friends starting to make some choices
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   That they were going to party in different ways in the week and do some things
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   But what bothered me is they all of a sudden started to say
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Hey Todd, look, if you're not going to do what we're going to do
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Then you're not going to hang where we hang
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And I was like, well what's that all about? I thought we were friends
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Friends run together and friends do things with one another because they like each other
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Not because we're just doing certain activities
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Are you telling me that you're not my friend if I don't do what you do?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And that was exactly what they started to tell me
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And I was just, the way I was wired, I was like, well wait a minute
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I wasn't going to be swayed by that peer pressure
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Just the way that I was made to no credit of my own
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I just kind of said, well then, to heck with that
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   We're not even friends
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Let's deal with that
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And so I went from being a guy that was kind of what I would say
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   In the mainstream of popularity and friend groups
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   To being pretty alone
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I would say completely alone
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And it was interesting, I got a call last Thursday
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   From a guy that knew me about this time
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And he happened to run across some messages
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And some talks that I had given about this Jesus
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And how my life had been radically changed
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And it just so happens, he was at a place where his heart was being tenderized
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And he called me 35, 40 years, that was actually 40 years later
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So this was before I knew Christ
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   This was my late teens
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And this guy wanted to talk to me
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And he said, hey man, I've got to tell you
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I've been listening to some of the stuff you've been saying
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And I've got to let you know, I'm learning
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And I have begun to understand a little bit about what you're talking about
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And I remember a time
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   When you were starting to make some choices
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   That I was in another group
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And man, we just destroyed you
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   We talked poorly of you
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And I remember this guy, wasn't just around me when I was in high school
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   He was later, he went to the same college I did
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And he talked about the fact that when he was in college
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   At one point, he came around with a group of friends
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   That were getting ready to go out to a bar
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And he said, Todd, you were going, at that time I had trusted Christ
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And I was actually headed to go pour into some high school kids somewhere
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And speak, and he said, man, we saw you knock on one of the bars with us
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And I want to tell you, I laid into you
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I talked about you behind your back
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And I did everything I could to destroy your reputation
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And to make others think poorly of you
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And he said, I just want to tell you, man
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I've come to know what you knew
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And it's changed my life
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Now what's interesting, about that same time
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I had some guys
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   When I was in high school
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And kind of in that transition period
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   That were a year or two ahead of me
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   One of his names, Jeff Kogan
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And Jeff Kogan
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Was the starting quarterback
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   When I was just a freshman in high school
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And was beginning to make some choices
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Because I wanted to compete on those levels
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   You know, in high school and beyond
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And Jeff Kogan saw me alone
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   He saw me without a friend group
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And Jeff Kogan, the starting quarterback
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   As a junior in the football team
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Learned my name
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And Jeff Kogan didn't just learn my name
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   He invited me to start to hang out with his friend groups
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Now at first, I was pretty shy
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Because I was just certain
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'm like, why would these guys want to hang out with me
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And want to break my little heart
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And want to maybe abuse me in some way
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Haze me in some way, I don't even know what that word meant
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   But I just didn't trust that anybody could really love me
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   But what Jeff Kogan did, is he learned my name
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   He sought me, he invited me in
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And he shared his friendship with me
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And he shared his friends with me
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And I went from being a guy
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   That was running alone
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   To all of a sudden, Paul Frazier
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Jacques, Jeff, Chip, Michelle
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Who was the captain of the cheerleading squad
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It was Dayton, Jeff
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Started to be my friend
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I'll never forget it
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Because I thought, man, there's no greater kindness
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   That you can show somebody
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Than to share friends with them
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I remember as my life went on
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You know, I spent some time in college
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   With a gal that ended up having a little bit of success
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   In the music field
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And she later got selected
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   To be the only female soloist
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   On the Michael Jackson Dangerous Tour worldwide
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I mean, she sang every duet with Michael Jackson
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Okay
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   You might have heard her name a little bit later
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   She went on to have her own independent career
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Her name was Cheryl Crow
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And Cheryl, you know, when she came to Dallas
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   With the Dangerous Tour, when Michael Jackson was like
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Justin Bieber, right
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   In fact, Michael Jackson made Justin Bieber
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Look like, you know, no one
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I mean, Michael Jackson was like the bomb
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And he was on the world tour
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And he was going around
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And Cheryl was coming through with that tour
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And I remember Cheryl had a backstage pass
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And we hung out
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And I remember her inviting me to kind of go backstage
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Before the Dangerous Tour in Dallas
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   That nobody could get tickets to
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And just saying, "Come on man, come on back here, Todd
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Here's the crew, here's the team"
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And I remember she was just sharing her life
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And her friends with me, and I was like, "That was alright"
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   You know, it was kind of fun to see that
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I remember when a friend did that with me with Garth Brooks
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I remember when I got to do that when I invited guys
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Into locker rooms and things of that sort
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Because you've got access somewhere
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   To do the fleeting, silly things
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And I want to tell you tonight
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I'm going to do the kindest thing I can do with you
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I'm going to share with you about my friend
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   His name is Jesus
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And there's no greater
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I mean, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Patrick Mahomes
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I don't care what little circle you're invited into
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   There is no greater friend than Jesus
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And I'm going to do the kindest thing I can do with you
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And I remember when people shared their friendships with me
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And I want to share with you about my great friend, Jesus
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And I want to share with you about my great friend, Jesus
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And I want to share with you about my great friend, Jesus
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   If you've got a Bible, turn to John 5
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I hope you always bring your Bible
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Because we want to show you that this is
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   This word is living and active
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And this word is true
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And it's beautiful and it's amazing
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And we're just going to tell you what happened when God walked the earth
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Now here's what's amazing
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Is that Jesus wasn't just anybody, he was God
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And when Jesus walked the earth
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   There was amazing
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Activity all around him
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And Jesus still lives today
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I just got through doing a podcast
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   With our friends here
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   We have what's called a church leaders podcast
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Which even if you're not a leader in the church
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It's great for you to listen to
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And they asked me to jump in with them
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   It was actually on discouragement
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And they just said, Todd, we want to talk to you about how people handle discouragement
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   In life and ministry
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And I just shared with them very honestly
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Look guys, I got to let you know
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I'm going to tell you why in almost now 30 plus years
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Of walking with Jesus
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   I've never had discouragement
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Here's why
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   I love watching God go to work
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I love believing that Jesus is still alive
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   That he was risen from the grave
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That when he ascended to sit at the right hand of the father
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   He intercedes for me
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   That his spirit, the spirit of God which indwelt in him
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   When he took on human form
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Is still here and dwells in me
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Because I'm a friend of God
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And when I am walking with Jesus
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   The kind of crazy things that happen
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   When Jesus walked the earth still happen
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   The things that happen when Jesus walked the earth
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Happen right where I am
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I'm going to make a claim that you really got to listen to me on
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And that is more miracles have happened here
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   At Watermark in the last six months
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Than in all of the gospels combined
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   More miracles
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   More radical
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   World changing things
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Have happened here at Watermark
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   In the last six months
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Than in all the New Testament stories combined
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Now let me just explain that to you a couple of ways
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   First of all you shouldn't be surprised
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Because Jesus said that's exactly what's going to happen
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   He said if you believe in me the works that I do
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   You will do also
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   In fact greater works than these will you do
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   If you believe in me
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   In the New Testament
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   In the life of Christ specifically
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Depending on how you count them
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   There's only 30 some odd miracles
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   That happen in all the gospels combined
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   We're now a group of people
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   That number in the thousands around here at Watermark
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   We walk with him
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   We're sharing the news of who Jesus is
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And the truth about who God is
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And we're sharing our friend Jesus and the work of God with others
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And so it shouldn't surprise you
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   That the blind see, the deaf hear
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   The lame walk and the dead are raised
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Now look
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I've never been a part of a resurrection
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Of a person who was flat lined
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Like dead in a grave for four days
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And somebody said
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   You know
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   John Doe come forth
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And the ground broke
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And the coffin was kicked open
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And the guy crawled out
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I've never been a part of that
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   There's no wheelchair stapled to the walls here
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Because I've never seen somebody
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Who was in a wheelchair
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Get up and be radically healed
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   After a lifetime of paralysis
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   But let me just tell you something
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   When Jesus said this
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   What he was saying there is
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   What I'm going to do is I'm going to teach sinners to live holy lives
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   What I'm going to show you tonight
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Is when Jesus did some of the miracles and healings he did
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And false teachers by the way
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Are going to take advantage
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Of some of the things in the bible that are easy to misinterpret
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And difficult to understand
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And they're going to exploit you if you're not careful
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Now I believe God can do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   If God wanted to raise people from the dead today
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Physically like he did with Lazarus
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   He could do it
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   If God wanted to have blind men see
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Because I spit in my hand and rub it on somebody's eyes with dirt
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   He could do it
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   There's no question that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   But you need to understand why Jesus did miracles
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And what the purpose of the miracles were
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And I'm going to introduce you to my friend Jesus
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And give you a biblical understanding of Jesus
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   So you're not taken advantage of by charlatans
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And so that your life can be radically changed
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   The way Jesus wants to radically change your life
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And that means if you're here and you're in a wheelchair tonight
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And you go out of here in a wheelchair
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   You can still have hope
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And begin to walk
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Not physically but walk
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   With a new perspective and a newness of life
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   If God wants to get you out of the wheelchair he can do that
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   But there's something better
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Let me encourage you with this
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I've got a friend, Johnny Erickson Tata
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Who is one of the godliest people I've ever met
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Johnny, J-O-N-I
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Erickson Tata
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Google her
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I do something called Real Truth Real Quick
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And just type in there healing
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And listen to Johnny and I talk about healing
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And Johnny who's been in a wheelchair
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   A quadriplegic
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Since she was 17
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Talks about what she really needs to be healed from
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Because she's had all kinds of faith healers come up to her
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   And talk to her
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   About if she just had enough faith they think they could heal her
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   They could get her out of the wheelchair
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   And what Johnny says is let me ask you a question
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Can I just tell you, I'd love to walk on this earth again
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   But if you really want to pray for my healing
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Would you pray for my anger
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Would you pray for my elitism, my pride
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   My belief that I'm better than you
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Would you heal that part of me
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Because even if I get out of this wheelchair
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   There's parts of me that are dead that need to be resurrected in newness of life
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   And Johnny talks about what's really broken in her life
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And how Christ has dealt with that
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   With amazing hope
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Listen to Johnny talk about if you have enough faith
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Will God heal you
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I beg you to watch that real truth real quick
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   But let me teach you about my Jesus
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   And let me tell you that right here and tonight
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Maybe in your life
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   You can begin to walk with a new hope
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Maybe their dead ears will begin to hear truth
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And your blind eyes will begin to see who Jesus really is
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   John chapter 5
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   John chapter 5
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   John chapter 5
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   John chapter 5
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Here we go
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Here's my Jesus
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   It says in verse 2
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   So one of the things I always love to tell you about my Bible
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Is that it's not just a collection
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Of stories
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   There is no Mount Olympus
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   That you can go visit
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   There is no
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   History
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   That you can really verify
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And test in a lot of other books
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Right
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   That claim to be holy
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   When you read and study Hinduism
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   It's called Hindu Mythology
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   This is called
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   History
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   It is God's story
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   It's H-I-S capital
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   His story anchored in the context of our history
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And you can test this book
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And verify it
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   You can make sense out of it
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Because there are names and places
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And dates and claims
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   That's not what happened
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Then we got to get rid of this book
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Do you know that until 1990 there had never been any evidence
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   There was a guy named David that lived
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And a lot of people mocked the Bible
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And said that David was just some venerated made up character
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Some hero
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   In Jewish history that never really existed
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   But a compilation of a lot of stories that were exaggerated
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Because they couldn't find existence of who David was
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And then just
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   About 20 some odd short years ago
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   We find evidence that there was a ruler named David
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Do you know that in the 1960's
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   There was no evidence that there was ever a prefect
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Named Pontius Pilate
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   But then in 1960 we found some stone right there by the Mediterranean Sea
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   That had the name Pontius Pilate on it
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Do you know there has never been a single archaeological discovery
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   In the history of the world
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   That has contradicted anything in this book
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Do you know there is not a single prophecy
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   That this book has said won't happen
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   That hasn't happened yet already
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   That needed to happen for this book to be called true
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   This is a book that God decided to anchor in history
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   So you can test it
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And make sense out of it
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   I've been to Bethesda
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   I've been through the Sheep Gate
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Right here in Jerusalem
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   At this place where there was
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Um
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   A lot of pagan practices that were going on
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Let me just read you the story
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   It says now they're in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   There was a pool which in Hebrew is called Bethesda
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   It's interesting Beth means house
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Hasad or Hesed
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Means love
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Or grace or kindness
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It's the most one of the most often used words in your Bible
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   It's the covenant love of God
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   The unconditional kindness of God
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   This is the house of grace
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   The house of kindness
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   That's what this place was called
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Now in Bethesda right here
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Um there was this
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Development and the reason there was a development there
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Is because there were springs
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And in these springs
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   You're going to find out
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   That um they believed that they held
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Some supernatural ability
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   To heal
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Check this
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   It says around this place
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   That had five porticos
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   In these lay a multitude of those who were sick
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   And blind and lame and withered
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   There was all kinds of evidences
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Of broken humanity
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   There was a blend there
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   It's called syncretism of Greek mythology
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Roman mythology and even just some
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Judaic belief that was right there
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   So by the way
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   If you go to this place today and you can go to it
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Bethesda it's still there it's been excavated
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   In about a 30 second walk
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   You will go through another gate
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And you'll be on what's called the temple mount
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   In about 3 minutes you could have been to what's called
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   The holy of holies
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   These were people
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   That were not seeking the God
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to be healed
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   These were people that were kind of
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Caught up over here
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   In worship in pagan practices
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   And cult worship and what had happened
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Is there was superstition in that day
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I'll read to you this little section
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Right here in verses 3 and 4
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   It says there was a bunch of folks that were lame and withered
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   That were waiting for the moving of the waters
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   For an angel of the Lord
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And this is now what they believed
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   This is not what happened
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   An angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Into the pool and stirred up the water
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Whoever then first after the stirring up of the water
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Stepped in was made well from whatever
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Disease with which he was afflicted
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Now let me ask you a question
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   What kind of people could get to a water first when it stirred
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   And by the way you're kind of like well what's that mean
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   What does the water stir? The water stirred because
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   They didn't know it but there was a deep spring that was there
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And every now and then when the water would come out
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And move forward because of rainy season
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Things like that there would be a flow
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   And the water would stir and it would come up
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   And bubble up and it would move the surface of the water
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Inside these pools and then people would
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Scurry to jump in and there were all kinds of people there
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Let me ask you a question
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   If there were people there that were lame and there were other people there
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   That were discouraged or there were people there
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   That were depressed or there were people there that had skin diseases
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Which people would make it into the water first?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It wouldn't be the lame people
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   If the belief was first come first serve
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Man you're going to be sitting right there
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   And if you're discouraged
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Probably the people, most of the people with the most psychosomatic illnesses
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Who believe that there's some healing power there
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And there's all kinds of evidence
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   If you believe something can help you
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   It typically can help you
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Especially if your diseases are not
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   You're quadriplegic or paralytic
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   You'd get in that water and you'd come out and go
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   I'm healed, I'm healed, I got it, I got it
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   And I guarantee you there'd be a fit of adrenaline
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I guarantee you if you were the first one in
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   There was a sense of belief
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   And it probably did something for you
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   At least in the short term
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Blind people wouldn't get in first
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   They couldn't see that the water stirred
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   If you ever go to some of the charlatans today
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   They're involved in healing ministries
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Watch carefully about how they move the critically ill
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And the sick and the wheelchairs away from the stage
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Watch the way that they are telling you
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   That you're going to be healed
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And you're going to be healed
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   And you're going to be healed
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   And they are telling you
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Sometimes even when people
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Are going through certain types of healings
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   That if it doesn't happen completely
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   In that moment, sometimes they put people in wheelchairs
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Who have limps and they get them up
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And they say stand up and they stand up with their limp
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And they go he's walking
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Just like he was walking before they put him in the wheelchair
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Now I'm going to tell you God can do whatever he wants to do
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Whenever he wants to do it
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   But a lot of what you see
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   On TV and amongst these charlatans
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Is exactly that
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   And it offends God
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And it offends Jesus
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   The reason that Jesus did miracles by the way
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Is because he was trying to show you who he was
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   The reason there's sickness
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   The reason there's disease
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   The reason there's death on this earth
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Is because of sin
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   God didn't create us with cancer
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And with disease
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   And with brokenness
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   There were no down syndrome children
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Born to Adam and Eve
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   If they conceived before the fall
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And there's no evidence that they did
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   All of that is a result
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Of us leaving the God of perfection
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And being left to our own way
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Sin and death and disease entered into the world
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   What Jesus is about to show you
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Is that he has the ability to reverse the effects of sin
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Who can do that?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Only God can reverse the effects of sin
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Because the effects of sin are here
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Because we have offended God
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   There's no other way
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   But to forgive God
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   There's a reason
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   For example when Jesus healed somebody else
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   He was sitting there and somebody came to him
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Who was lame
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And Jesus looked at this guy
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And he said hey your sins are forgiven
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And the religious leaders were very offended
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   They go hey you can't forgive sins
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Nobody can forgive sins except God
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And so what did Jesus do?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Because that is an excellent point
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Because sin is an offense against God
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   And so what did Jesus say
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   He said that no man has authority on earth to forgive sins
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   In other words that I am the visible image of the invisible God
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   That this isn't just Jesus walking
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   This is God walking
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Remember how I told you I'm going to do the kindest thing I can do
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Which is to share my friend with you
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I'm going to share with you the truth about who God is
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   You want to know what God looks like? Look at Jesus
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And by the way isn't it interesting
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   That even people
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Who aren't Christians
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Love Jesus
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Because we're like
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   If people could really be like that
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Really that loving, really that selfless
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I'd want to know him more
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And you should want to know more of Jesus
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   But Jesus says
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Hey that's an excellent point
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Only God can forgive sins
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   In order that you might know who I am
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   I say to you take up your pallet and walk
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Because only God can give regeneration
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   To paralyzed crippled legs
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   This wasn't the guy with a limp
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   This was the guy that stood up and walked
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   The reason Jesus did the miracles he did
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Is to authenticate his words
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   He said if you don't believe me
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Believe the works that I do
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Jesus a little bit later said this
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   He said there's not going to be any more signs
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I didn't come here to do a bunch of signs
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   He didn't come here to heal everybody
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   He came here to not heal everybody
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   From the effects of the fall
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   In short term temporal ways
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   He came to heal everybody from the effects of the fall
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   And their separation from God
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   He said heaven's going to be where there's no disease
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Heaven's going to be where there's no tears
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Heaven's going to be where there's no death
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   On this earth there's still going to be
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Paralyzation, cancer, betrayal, and despair
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   But I am going to give you hope
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   And I'm going to restore you into relationship with me
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   So that when judgment comes upon sin
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   It passes over you
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And I move you into the kingdom I intended for you
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   But I'm not going to heal everybody
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Guess what Jesus didn't heal everybody
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   We're at a place where there's scores of afflicted people
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And my friend Jesus walks up
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And he says this
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   There was a man there who had been ill for 38 years
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   There's certain numbers, there's a reason that the Bible has in it what it has in it
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   I mean there's a reason that John put down 38
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And you might go well Todd what's the reason John put down 38?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Well here's an idea
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   There are certain numbers in societies that always mean something
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Right?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Like in America, if I say 9/11
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Does that mean something to you?
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   That number, those numbers together mean something to you don't they?
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   The number 1776 means something to you doesn't it? In America?
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Say yes, I remember American history
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Right?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   There are certain numbers that mean something
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   You can even go kind of the superstitious way
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   I mean February 14th means something for you, right?
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   It means you're alone again, despairing and depressed
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   [Laughter]
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   That's right, it's sad day, singles awareness day, that's what Valentine's is
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   [Laughter]
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   But there's certain numbers that mean something
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   If you were a Jew, the number 38 meant something to you
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Now listen, Jesus came to reveal who he was
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   The reason 38 meant something to you, if you went back and looked in the book of Deuteronomy
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   It talks about how the fact that God wanted to take Israel
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And deliver them out of Egypt and the oppression of the powers of the earth
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And set them free from being slaves to free
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Take them from a place of oppression to a place of promise
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   In a land flowing with milk and honey
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Where they would live in cities and in homes that they did not build
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   That they would be safe and have protection
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   It was a picture of what God wants to do for all humanity
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   And God didn't uniquely love the Jews
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   He chose to show his love to the Jews
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   That all the nations of the earth could be blessed through the Jews
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   That was his idea
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   So that all the nations of the earth would know that he is God
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   But what happens is that they were led out of Egypt
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   And as God then sent spies into the holy land
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   And showed them what they were going to go take
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   There were giants in the land
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And they go, man, we can't fight those people, we can't take those people
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   So the 12 spies went back and 10 of them said
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   There's no way, man, we got our clock clean
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Two of them said, no, we can do this because God is for us
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   God just delivered us from Egypt
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Surely he can give us what he said he's going to give us there
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   But the 10 carried the day
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And took the whole nation into a place where they did not trust God
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   And so God said, this wicked generation
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Shall all pass away
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And then I'll take a new generation to the land that believes in me
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Guess how long it was from the moment that he pronounced that judgment
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Until they got into the land, the answer is 38 years
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   They lived a life of wondering and oppression
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And hopelessness and despair
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   It's the wilderness wondering years
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Here's a guy that is 38
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   By the way, 38 was longer than the average life expectancy
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   During the time of Christ
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   In other words, everything about this guy's life
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   From beginning to end was lame, right?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Was hopeless
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   And there's nobody that could help him
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   He was without God and without hope in the world
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Trusting in superstitions to heal him
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Had nobody who cared for him
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   You're going to find a little bit later
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   He said, there's no man who could help me
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   And he was exactly right, there's no man that could help him
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And I'm here to tell you tonight, there's no man that can help you
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   This man didn't know God, but God knew him and knew his despair
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And you're going to see that this man
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Jesus uniquely went and grabbed him
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Because he was trying to show you something
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   He knew he was trying to say, hey, I can get you out of your wonderings
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   And your wilderness
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   And to all of us, he's just saying, are you sick and tired of your lame life?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Jesus asked him amazing questions
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   The question I'm going to ask you tonight, because my friend wants you to hear it
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And the question is found right here in verse 6
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   It says, when Jesus saw him lying there
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And he knew that he had already been a long time in that condition
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   He knew he'd been there his entire life
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   He said to him something crazy
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   He said, do you wish to get well?
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   And he said, I wish to get well
