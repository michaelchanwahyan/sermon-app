00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 [music]

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Well, welcome to the porch. We are great. I'm great. Let me back up.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Welcome to the porch. It's great to be with you guys tonight. Let's go. Come on.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 It's porch day. Come on, y'all. That whole thing threw me off, the tech guy,

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 but much love, brother. I love you. Man, if you're watching with us online,

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 welcome wherever you're watching. For all of our porch live locations out there,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Houston, El Paso, Boise, Idaho, Ballaton, Minnesota, Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 wherever you're watching, Oklahoma City, we are so glad that you tuned in with us tonight.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 My name is Josiah. I have the privilege of serving on staff here at the porch,

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 and I get to oversee our volunteer leaders. And listen, if you're ready to, like,

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 man, if you want to go hard after Jesus, man, you want to change the world,

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 listen, I encourage you to come find me tonight at the front of the stage,

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 or you can just go back to your 8 to 5 and just be average.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Oh, man, someone, that just hurt, and I just offended everybody in the room that had 8 to 5 jobs.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Listen, I'm playing. I'm playing, but for real, if you're ready to go all in with Jesus,

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 hey, and you're looking for a place to serve, I would love to talk with you tonight.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Well, hey, as we get going, and I'd like to share with y'all this meme going around.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I'm sure you've heard it. It's this meme, "How it started versus how it's going."

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 "How it started versus how it's going," right?

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And so, man, I've been off the grid for a few months,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 mainly because of what I'm about to talk about tonight.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 So I haven't really been on social media, but as I was preparing for this talk,

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 some friends of mine showed me this meme and showed me what was happening.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And so I just thought I'd share with you my top five. Here we go.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Here are my favorites. Lunchables.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Man, I don't know what you're talking about. Lunchables for life, baby. Come on.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Like, to the day I die, I'm still on that train.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Next one. Ah.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Listen, that's just funny, because some of it is true, right?

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Some of it is true. Maybe it's because your name is Muhammad Ali, right?

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Next one. Oh, yeah, from my dog moms out there. Come on.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Let's go next. Ooh.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 That speaks for itself, right? Too close to home?

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Someone said, "Woo."

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Last one. Here we go. We'll end on this.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Happy 2020, right? 2020. We all know how that's going.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Oh, man, by the way, MJ's still the GOAT. Just want to tell you that.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Throw it out there. Yes, he's better than LeBron.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 And all my boys and girls who are millennials said, "Amen."

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 All you Gen Xers, the next generation is like, "No, man, it's LeBron."

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Listen, but really, hey, 2020 has been a year, right?

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Like, it has been a year, and as we get closer to the end of 2020,

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I bet you have your own version of how it started versus how it's going.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Like, 2020, man, it was going to be your year.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Like, you were going to get that ring. Like, you were going to get married.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Right? You were going to get that job, and then you're working your way up.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 You're going to get that promotion.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Hey, it was the year that you were going to break the addiction, get off the medication.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It was going to be the year that you got in the best shape of your life.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 You were going to save that 20 pounds of unwanted LBs, right?

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Like, it was your year, man. You were going to find true peace.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And the expectations we hope for in 2020 versus the reality of this year,

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 listen, they're very two different stories.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Some of us have never felt more alone, job loss.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Some of us had to move back in with parents.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Still single and lonely, political expectations not met.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 When are we getting a vaccine?

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 When is everything just going to go back to normal?

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I'm sick of this mask.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 If that JD comes up here one more time to try to tell me what to do, right?

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 It's like some of you are just fighting it right now.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I ain't wearing no mask.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 You got to get me out of this place, right?

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 I just want everything to be normal again.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And there's many of us right now that would raise our hands and, bro,

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 you're going to ask me to wear a mask?

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 It's putting more anxiety on me.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Living in fear.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Some of you, if you had to be honest, you would say, hey, I'm not okay.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Things are not okay.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 I'm full of anxiety.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Looking for satisfaction in what the Bible would call contentment.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 This word contentment, this is what I want to talk to us about tonight.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 It's not a word we use a lot in our day.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 What do I mean by contentment?

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I mean this.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Hey, I'm okay.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Hey, no matter what happens, not just this superficial I'm good, I'm okay.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 No, on a soul level, like I'm okay.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Single, engaged or married, I'm okay.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Whether I get the job or I get the promotion, like I'm okay.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Think about the very -- like the worst thing that could happen to you.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 You say, I'm okay.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I'm not distracted.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I'm not depressed.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I'm not overwhelmed.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And really, man, when I think about that, I even ask myself, is that even

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 possible?

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Is this Jesus thing really the answer?

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Can I really find that type of peace?

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Can I really be okay when things are not okay?

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 That's the question we're answering tonight.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And I believe God's word has something to say about this tonight.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I believe God's word is going to offer hope to a generation and a culture and a

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 world that, man, seems really chaotic right now.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 We're going to be in Philippians chapter 4.

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 If you're new to the Bible, you just open to the middle and Philippians is

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 towards the back.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians,

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Ephesians, Philippians.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And here we're going to find Paul, who's the author of Philippians, God

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 through Paul.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 He's writing this to the church in Philippi.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And he says, makes a really bold statement.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 He says, I found the secret to contentment.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 It's literally phrased like that in this text.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 He found the secret to be okay when things are not okay.

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And any time I think about, man, that's a secret.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 What?

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Like I'm listening.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Like my ears are up.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Like I'm ready.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Whatever he's about to say next, right?

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 If you don't know Paul's story, he is a guy who started out in his life

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 persecuting Christians as far as killing Christians.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 But then quickly Jesus arrested his heart and he went from persecuting

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Christians to being a hope dealer bent on spreading the good news of Jesus to

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 an unknown world.

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 The church in Philippi was one of the first churches he planted in Europe.

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 It's a real place, real people.

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Let's never forget that as we open up God's word.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And listen, the secret isn't found in a pill or a drink.

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 It's not found in something you can buy at North Park Mall.

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Where is it found?

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Glad you asked.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Paul says it's found in three things.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 First, thinking about the right things.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,700
 second, practicing your faith. And lastly, before you leave tonight, I hope you see this

129
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,920
 idea that we should hope in Christ. Let's dive in. Philippians chapter four will be

130
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:26,380
 in verse eight, starting there. Paul says this, "Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever

131
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,340
 is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever

132
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:40,900
 is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things." Just

133
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,820
 circle that right there. Circle, "Think about such things." Like Paul is sitting in prison

134
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,920
 right now. He is in a jail cell. Let's make sure you have the weight of what's happening

135
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:59,540
 right now with Paul. He's in a jail for persecuting, or not persecuting, he used to persecute.

136
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:06,260
 He's in jail for sharing the gospel because the Christians are being persecuted right

137
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:14,020
 now in this time. And he says this, "Hey, if anyone has the merit and the credit to

138
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:21,300
 say this, it's Paul." He's sitting in a cold prison, locked up for sharing his faith. And

139
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,180
 he says, "Hey, if you're going to find the secret to contentment, if you're going to

140
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:31,660
 be okay when things are not okay, first spiritual truth is this, think about the right things.

141
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:38,340
 Thinking about the right things will help you be okay when things are not okay." The

142
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,180
 reason why you're not okay right now is because your mind is drifting. And the Bible would

143
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:49,140
 say as your mind drifts to all these distractions that you came in with, and as we learned last

144
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,220
 week here at the porch through Jenny Allen, I hope you got to listen to that if you weren't

145
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,220
 there, but the Bible would say that we are to take every thought captive, 2 Corinthians

146
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,940
 10, 5, to the obedience of Christ. In other words, every thought we have should be filtered

147
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,660
 through this book that I hold in my hand called Scripture, the Bible. What you think about

148
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,340
 has the power to make or break your contentment. Do you know that? Because the mind is powerful.

149
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:23,260
 The mind is found in our wanting. When you walked into this place tonight, you, honestly,

150
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:30,700
 you had want. There was something you wanted. There's something that you're fixated on.

151
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,900
 What are you thinking about? What's on your mind? Don't answer it out loud. It could be

152
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:45,980
 awkward, right? Nervous laughter there. Some of you came in here with the desire to get

153
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:52,500
 married, and listen, contentment isn't the absence of desires. Let me just say that real

154
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,740
 quick. Contentment is not the absence of desires. Some of you come in here with the desire to

155
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,820
 get married, which is a good and noble thing. Someone said, "Hey, when you just become content,

156
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,020
 that's when God will give you your spouse." That's just a lie. That's just a lie. Now,

157
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,220
 it might be true that God wants to grow you in your contentment in Him first, but it's

158
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,580
 not wrong to desire a spouse. Marriage, from God's Word, says it's a good thing. Marriage

159
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:25,380
 is a gift from God. Paul is saying this because he knows our thinking dictates our living.

160
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:31,180
 This is why he says, "Think about such things that are true, that are noble, that are right,

161
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:40,580
 that are pure." He goes on and says, "Your thinking will be fueled by your focus." What

162
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:49,540
 are you focusing on tonight? Some of you are anxious because you watch the news, and it's

163
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:58,780
 filling your mind with anxious thoughts. What if? Fear. Some of you are discontent because

164
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,940
 you're always on your Pinterest board, right? Maybe it's that private Pinterest board that

165
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:12,460
 nobody can see, only you know it's there. Do you think you're going to be more okay

166
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,860
 with the season God has you in or less if you continue to pursue that? Only you can

167
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,220
 answer that question. If you struggle with singleness, let me talk to you ladies for

168
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:30,040
 just a second. Do you think you're going to be okay continuing to take in episode after

169
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:39,180
 episode of The Bachelorette if you're struggling with singleness? Will it help you or is it

170
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:47,140
 hurting you? What do you think? If you struggle with insecurity and jealousy and body image,

171
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:53,100
 is social media helping you or hurting you? If you struggle with lust, just following

172
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:02,140
 women who post bikini pictures or those really great women and men, this is okay, vice versa,

173
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:08,420
 right, who are kind of these athletes and they're fitness athletes. Do you think that's

174
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,980
 helping you or is it hurting you? If you're trying to get out of debt, you think casually

175
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,220
 walking through Nordstrom's and you just say, "I'm just checking things out." But you know

176
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,780
 this, the more you check things out, the more you're going to have a tendency to want to

177
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:31,700
 buy something and so you do. And so we hop on Instagram and we watch shows to compare

178
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,300
 our lives to others and we don't struggle with the old school OCD, we struggle with

179
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,340
 the new school OCD. It's the obsessive comparison disorder, right, where we're just comparing

180
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,020
 our life to everyone around us, thinking that we're going to be satisfied by doing that.

181
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,220
 And you know it's just breeding discontentment. It's causing us to buy things we shouldn't,

182
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,500
 it causes us to look at things we can't touch while touching ourselves in a way that dishonors

183
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:06,300
 God. I'm just being real tonight. It causes us to isolate ourselves thinking, "Hey, we're

184
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:13,620
 the only ones who struggle." Come on. When we struggle with comparison, it robs us of

185
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,180
 creativity and energy and peace and these are three things that you're going to need

186
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:28,220
 to thrive in life. Compare is sin. Compare is sin. Comparison. Think of it that way.

187
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,860
 Yale University said that those who spend less time using social media are more happy

188
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,300
 and healthy than those who use them often. And listen, I'm not a hater on social media.

189
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:44,300
 The problem with me is I like it a little too much. The problem with me is not that

190
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:52,020
 I don't like it, I just like it a little too much. And so it feeds something in me that

191
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:58,340
 ends up leaving me empty and unsatisfied with what I do have. Listen, I've never seen anybody

192
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:04,300
 skip into my office or never met a friend or a young adult for lunch and man, they're

193
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,660
 just so happy and I'm like, "Hey bro, why are you so happy, man?" And I've never heard

194
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,660
 him say this, "Oh man, I figured it out. I downloaded Instagram. I've just been looking

195
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:20,940
 at it all day." It's like, no man, that does not happen. I've never heard it because you

196
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:28,980
 know you're feeding something that isn't good. So you go to these places to compare your

197
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,900
 misery and all it does is salt your wounds, right? It just throws salt on the wounds and

198
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:41,380
 yeah, y'all broke up and you find yourself following him on social media just to compare

199
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,740
 the misery. Just hopefully, hopefully you jump in and you're like, "Man, I hope he's

200
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,900
 feeling the way I did," only to find out he's not. And it's just adding more salt, more

201
00:15:50,900 --> 00:16:04,180
 salt on that wound. "Oh, he got the promotion? Gosh, I'm so much better than him. Oh, how

202
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,900
 does that girl have enough, how does she have enough money to go on another vacation and

203
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,820
 then to get more new clothes? Like, come on. Like, where's this come?" And what happens

204
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:22,860
 is you're just feeding something inside of you that's leading to discontentment. And

205
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,340
 in your season of setbacks, you look at others who are in seasons of advances and you just

206
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:36,700
 begin to be marked by more anxiety and depression. And so how do we overcome this? Like some

207
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,420
 of you tonight might need to get off social media because every time you jump on, you're

208
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,940
 fueled with discontentment. You've got to walk away from the thing that is feeding your

209
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:53,220
 discontentment. That's why Paul says, "Hey, what you think is ultimately going to fuel

210
00:16:53,220 --> 00:17:01,900
 your focus." I found myself watching sports a few months back and in one hand I had my

211
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:09,540
 phone and I was vacillating between Instagram and texting and email and I just began to

212
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,300
 have all these things that began to distract me and text messages. And then I read verses

213
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:23,700
 like Psalm 101.3 and it says, "I will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless."

214
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,780
 See, I put a lot of worthless things before me at times, not necessarily things that are

215
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:34,100
 bad in and of themselves. And it was like the Spirit of God said, "Hey, Josiah, why

216
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,780
 don't you take a break because you're feeding something inside of you that quite frankly

217
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:50,780
 you won't ever be satisfied." And so I don't know what that looks like for you. Maybe it's

218
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:59,900
 the same. Maybe you need to take a season off from the thing that's feeding your discontentment.

219
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:06,900
 Maybe you need to break away from the madness of comparison and get off of all social media

220
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,480
 for a season. Maybe just take a week off and watch the Spirit of God breathe something

221
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:18,860
 fresh into your life. I was telling a group of guys that I meet with weekly, it's like,

222
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:25,980
 "Man, I feel like a weight's been lifted. I'm not tempted like I was to look at things

223
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:33,100
 I shouldn't look at and to compare my life with people that quite frankly don't even

224
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:40,020
 know." I feel like a weight's been lifted. Paul's saying, "Be careful what you think

225
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:47,060
 about. Thinking about the right things will lead you to be okay when things are not okay.

226
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,020
 Your thinking affects your contentment." Not only does he say this, but he says, "Your

227
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,460
 practice will affect your contentment." Verse 9, he goes on and he says, "What you have

228
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,460
 learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things." And look at the

229
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:08,380
 promise porch. The God of peace will be with you. You know what Christians do when they're

230
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,260
 not okay? They actually live out their faith. This is what they do. This is what they do

231
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,860
 in the past and this is what they do in the present. They actually live out their faith

232
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,540
 when they come up to places in their life that are just not okay. When they have discontentment,

233
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:29,620
 they actually decide to live out their faith. They wake up and spend time with God. Let

234
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:35,500
 me ask you, do you think you're going to be okay without putting that discipline of getting

235
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,640
 in God's Word and hearing what He has to say day in and day out, do you think you're really

236
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,940
 going to be okay without putting that into practice? We as men and women of God are called

237
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,820
 to practice the things of Christ. We're called to read and study scripture. We're called

238
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,100
 to get into community. One of the number one things I did after I came to Christ was to

239
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,820
 change my playground and my playmates and have men that were going to call me up and

240
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:12,260
 call me out and say, "God has more for you." Following someone who follows Christ, in other

241
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,340
 words find someone that will mentor you, that will disciple you, that will walk alongside

242
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,540
 of you, pray and talk to God, confess sin struggles, pursue healing from addictions,

243
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:27,300
 walk in love, humility and kindness, flee sexual immorality and drunkenness, drugs and

244
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:33,740
 anything that will take you off course from what God has for you. Paul says practicing

245
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,540
 the right things will equal peace. And if you don't have peace, maybe it's because you're

246
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:45,720
 not practicing the right things or you have wrong practice. I remember several years ago

247
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:53,380
 I was dating a girl and man I walked into the relationship with all the right intentions

248
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:02,860
 and quickly I started beginning to compromise. I'm just telling you man, this girl, everything

249
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:09,060
 I wanted. She had the Instagram bio, Philippians 4.13 but you scroll down a little bit more

250
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:14,660
 and let me just tell you it was a little revealing. I remember in that moment I would just say,

251
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,340
 "Oh man, it ain't that bad. Come on. I've seen a lot worse." You know what I'm saying?

252
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,820
 I would just compare. "Oh, I can always find someone worse than her." Which gave me security

253
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:32,460
 in the fact that I was fine. I was good. And I remember in that moment that there began

254
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,700
 to be a lack of conviction because there was a lack of contentment. See where there's a

255
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,460
 lack of contentment, there will be a lack of conviction. And where there's a lack of

256
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:56,580
 conviction you and I will always, we will always, and I mean this, be willing, willingness,

257
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,420
 there will be a willingness to settle for less than God's best. Did you hear that? There

258
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,060
 will be a willingness to always settle for less than God's best and in that moment I

259
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,180
 promise you I was settling for less than God's best and I would make excuses. I was the king

260
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:18,140
 of excuses. And there was a season that I settled and I remember the Holy Spirit just

261
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:28,620
 saying, "Josiah, you know this isn't right. You know you're making excuses." Paul says,

262
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,820
 "The things that you've learned from me, received from me, heard from me, seen in me, practiced

263
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,980
 such." This is such a bold statement Paul's making. He's saying, "Hey, follow me." Why?

264
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:45,620
 Because I follow Christ. See Paul was so confident in how he followed Christ. Not perfectly,

265
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,120
 but how he read God's Word, how he confessed sin, how he served others, how he was out

266
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:57,460
 sharing the Gospel, how he was truly applying the things that God was teaching him. And

267
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,300
 he says, "Hey, you want to follow Christ? You can follow me." I wonder how many of you

268
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:08,780
 tonight can say that. How many of you tonight can be that bold and say, "Hey, you can follow

269
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:17,860
 me. I know I'm not perfect, but I'm pursuing the perfect one." And this verse here is really

270
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:24,580
 a discipleship verse. This word discipleship just means, "Hey, you're going to make a radical

271
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:30,500
 self-donation into someone else's life for the purpose of godliness and multiplication."

272
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,780
 It's this idea that, "Hey, you were created to invest your life into someone else and

273
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,660
 those of you that have been coming to the porch long enough and you've been singing

274
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,700
 songs and you've been hearing messages, but you walk out of the auditorium and you do

275
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:51,300
 nothing with it." God would say tonight, Paul would say, "Hey, it's your job Christian to

276
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,820
 give that away." They see some of us man, we come into this place and we have more truth

277
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,480
 than what we can obey and some of us man, we need to know less and do more instead of

278
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,740
 knowing more and doing less. And some of you right now, you're not experiencing true contentment.

279
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,860
 You're not experiencing how to be okay when things are not okay because you're not putting

280
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:19,980
 into practice the things that we see in Scripture.

281
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:27,780
 I heard this phrase a while back. It says, "Practice like you play." Practice like you

282
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:34,500
 play. And I grew up playing baseball. That was my jam. It was my sport. I love baseball.

283
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,420
 And I remember going into high school and I loved it. I wasn't the most talented. I

284
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,660
 was just kind of the hustle guy. They called me Charlie Hustle. I never really got many

285
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:49,260
 awards but for some reason I got to go to college and play. But in high school, I really

286
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:55,260
 didn't have anyone to follow. I just picked up some really bad habits and I just kind

287
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,800
 of scraped by and then some coach gave me a shot in college. And I remember my freshman

288
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,520
 year of college just riding the bench. But what was so significant about my freshman

289
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,020
 year in college is I had some upperclassmen, some seniors come alongside of me and said,

290
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:16,060
 "Hey, Josiah, I see something in you, bro. And I want you just to follow me this year.

291
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,500
 I want you to imitate what I do." And so I would, man. I would follow them and I would

292
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,060
 watch how they threw the baseball, how they fielded the baseball, how they hit the baseball,

293
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:30,780
 how they worked out in the gym, how they dieted. And I had to unlearn some of the things that

294
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:37,460
 I learned in high school. And I remember following those men and I remember just saying, "Man,

295
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,860
 this is incredible. I've never learned this much before." They would show me how to properly

296
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,940
 prepare and play the game of baseball. They would say, "Imitate me. Watch what I do and

297
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:54,660
 do it." And they would coach me on the importance of practicing the right ways, taking no shortcuts.

298
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:04,360
 And listen, how you practice determines your progress on the field. You hear me? And listen,

299
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:10,100
 how you practice gives you the confidence to face whatever might happen in the game.

300
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:16,680
 And it's true with your spiritual life. How you practice spiritually will give you the

301
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:23,120
 progress that you ultimately want. And how you practice spiritually will ultimately give

302
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,420
 you the confidence that you're going to need as life throws curveballs at you like we've

303
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:40,940
 seen in 2020. It's the questions that you're asking, "What are you practicing? Where are

304
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:46,180
 you spending your time? What are you investing in?" What you're truly looking at when no

305
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,260
 one's looking, what you're truly doing when you're behind closed doors. It's not just

306
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,500
 some Insta bio. It's not just a Tuesday night service at the porch, right? So right now,

307
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,500
 if I looked at your spiritual life and I asked you these three questions, what would be your

308
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,460
 answer? Question number one, who or what are you imitating? Are you imitating a political

309
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,280
 figure? Are you imitating People Magazine or Vogue? Like are you imitating those friends

310
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,140
 that you know aren't following Christ but man, you just want to fit in man and you just,

311
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:25,340
 and you can't shake it. Is your life worth imitating? Could you say, "Hey, imitate me,

312
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:31,500
 follow me, follow Christ." Like I wonder if I was to watch you or I was to follow you

313
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,080
 and I watched and I heard the things that came out of your mouth and the things that

314
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:43,200
 you did, I wonder would I fall more in love with Christ as a result? What does your spiritual

315
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,620
 practice look like for you? Like what does that look like? It's like some of you tonight,

316
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,940
 like you need to leave this room, like you've been making excuses after excuses and 2020

317
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,220
 is about to come to an end and listen, you're not all in. But we've created an environment

318
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:05,060
 called First Steps up in the loft every single week and you can go and you can hear more

319
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:09,380
 about how to get in community and how to find people that are going to come alongside of

320
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:16,340
 you. Come up right here at the end of service and I would love to talk with you about what

321
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:25,380
 it looks like to spiritually practice your faith. What it looks like to fight against

322
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:33,820
 sin, to be a man, to not make excuses. I'm not talking about perfection, I'm talking

323
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:42,460
 about pursuing the one who is perfect and trusting that in that process, in that pursuit,

324
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:51,020
 He'll give you what you need. And so we think about the right things, we practice our faith

325
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,160
 and last truth that's going to help us learn the secret of contentment is hoping in Christ.

326
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:03,020
 Look at what Philippians 4, 11 through 13 says, "Not that I speak of being in need,

327
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:09,820
 for I've learned in whatever situation I am in to be content." Listen, I know how to be

328
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,820
 brought low Paul says and I know how to abound in any and every circumstance. I have learned

329
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:21,540
 the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. And look at what he says here, the

330
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:28,140
 climax, the coffee cup verse, the eye black verse for the athletes, right? The t-shirt

331
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,900
 verse, the one that we throw on our Insta bios, it's this, "I can do all things through

332
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:43,980
 Him who strengthens me." And here we see the secret to life. I can do all things through

333
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,260
 Christ who strengthens me. But you know what's sad about this? We just slap it on a coffee

334
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:57,120
 mug. We just slap it on the Insta bios. But when we look around the world we see a world

335
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,180
 that doesn't say, "Hey I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." No, it

336
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:05,100
 says, "I can do all things through my good looks. I can do all things through my gifts.

337
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,460
 I can do all things through my job. I can do all things through my money. I can do all

338
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,580
 things through my popularity. I can do all things through my followers on Instagram.

339
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:22,860
 I can do all things through my 401K. I can do all things through my future relationship."

340
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:31,280
 But the opposite is just as true, if not truer. I can do all things when I don't get the job.

341
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,520
 I can do all things when God is calling me to make hard decisions, to walk away from

342
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:44,640
 some things that I began to compromise in. And I begin to settle for less than God's

343
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:53,600
 best. I can do all things when I don't win the game, when I don't get the promotion,

344
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,160
 when the cancer does come. See we have used this verse as selfish motivation to get what

345
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,840
 we want and Paul's saying, "No, no, no. This isn't just for the good times. It's for the

346
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:11,000
 bad times." Notice what Paul is saying here. "In any and every circumstance I've learned

347
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,760
 how to be content, whether it's the lowest of lows or the highest of highs." See a lot

348
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,760
 of us come into tonight and we've confused happiness with joy, where happiness is based

349
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:25,120
 on your happenings, man. You have a great happening, man, you're good. You're happy.

350
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,120
 But when that happening is low, you're like, "Bro, what just happened?" And I am reading

351
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,680
 tonight that Paul is offering, and through Christ, he's offering us something else. He's

352
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,880
 offering us a deep-seated joy that's not based on happiness. It's based on who Christ is.

353
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:50,840
 Do you know Him? That you can navigate any circumstance that comes your way. This is

354
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,400
 why people who have everything they've ever wanted, aka Hollywood, they end up depressed,

355
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,800
 have affairs, and then many times commit suicide. People who own private islands have to wake

356
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,560
 up and take a pill every single day. Nothing wrong with taking a pill, but you get the

357
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:18,040
 drift. And so Paul knows what it's like to be on both ends of the spectrum. Paul wasn't

358
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:25,680
 robbed of joy because of his circumstances, but because of his focus. His focus was solely

359
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,760
 on Christ. See Proverbs 27, 20 says this, "Death and destruction are never satisfied

360
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,840
 and neither are the human eyes." I had a fire pit a few weeks back, and it was cool outside,

361
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:44,760
 kind of like right now, and I remember feeding that fire just twigs and leaves and some logs,

362
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,000
 some wood. And it began to consume those things. And listen, this is a picture of our heart

363
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,080
 that when we put something in our hearts and we try to satisfy it with other things other

364
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,360
 than Christ, like alcohol, porn, gossip, and anger, like it leaves us wanting for more.

365
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,600
 We know this to be true. Listen, this is why you go to bed at night, asking the question,

366
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:15,600
 "Is that it?" And Paul's saying, "Hey, no it's not it. There's more to life. There's

367
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,940
 hope." And the worst thing that God could ever do for any of us is to give us satisfaction

368
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,720
 and contentment with something other than Himself. That's the worst thing He could do

369
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,840
 for any one of us. Sometimes my prayer over young adults is, "I'm praying that God would

370
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:43,040
 make you so miserable that you have no choice but to look inward and upward." You know,

371
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:49,280
 when this played out in my life, this idea that Jesus is enough, I was in a dark season,

372
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:57,240
 man. I remember it. I was 26 years old. I was lying in my bed after a series of breakups

373
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,040
 and man, I turned a corner. I wanted to be God's man. I surrendered my life to Christ

374
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,000
 and I was like, "Yeah, I'm in. I'm all in with this God thing. I'm going." And then

375
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,640
 year after year after year, I found myself single. Listen, I know there's a lot of other

376
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,680
 needs in the room that are way bigger than that, but that was mine. And I remember at

377
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,600
 26, 27 years old this season, all the way up to 30 years old, I remember at times crying

378
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,200
 in bed, like just tears. I'm telling you, I'm cool. I'm cool if you know that I cry.

379
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,680
 Tears rolling down my face, man. Some of you men are like, "I never share that." Well,

380
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:42,400
 good for you. Maybe you should. Maybe that would help. And I just remember just having

381
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:49,520
 tears running down my face saying, "God, I don't know. I think you've got it wrong, God."

382
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,400
 And I remember God saying, "Hey, am I enough to decide?" And I remember saying, "I don't

383
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,760
 know if you are." Like this is the one thing I never thought I'd have to wrestle with.

384
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:10,000
 I never had to begin to fight. And honestly, that season, God began to sustain me in ways

385
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,900
 like I just talked about tonight through community, through other men, pointing me to the Scripture

386
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:22,320
 when I didn't want to believe this thing. Confession of sin, like just confessing, "Hey,

387
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:33,880
 I'm weak. I'm not in a good place." A discipline where I got into God's Word, renewed my mind.

388
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,760
 And through that season of like even shaking the selfishness that was in my heart where

389
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,200
 I replaced it with serving, God began to do something in me and He began to show me, "Hey,

390
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:52,040
 that there's more to life than just a relationship. That, hey, I might have that for you, Josiah,

391
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,480
 but hey, listen, that's not the end. I'm the end." And that's a really hard thing. I'm

392
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:06,600
 not minimizing it. I wrestled with it for a long time. And through that season, I learned

393
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:13,400
 that Jesus was enough. I chose to place my trust in Him. Listen, this is what Paul is

394
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,400
 getting at. Are you going to hope in Christ? I wonder if there's a generation of young

395
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,960
 adults tonight that would say, "Hey, I'm not just putting it on a coffee cup. I'm not just

396
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,920
 putting it on a verse. I'm not just putting it on the Instagram bio, but I can do all

397
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,320
 things through Christ who strengthens me. No matter what comes my way, no matter what

398
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,640
 happens, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." And that would be the

399
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,400
 anthem of your life, no matter what. No matter what. That's what Paul is getting at here

400
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,120
 tonight. Through God, he's saying, "Hey, this is what I want to get you to. You think that

401
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,120
 there's other things that are going to satisfy you and they won't. I'm giving you these things.

402
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,800
 If you have them, awesome. Leverage them to make me known and to know me more." That's

403
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:07,560
 the point. Not that you would find fulfillment in those things alone.

404
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:16,360
 Paul learned that Christ was enough. He realized that he couldn't do it on his own. And you

405
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:24,920
 know what I love about this season of Corona? Maybe the one thing. Is it stripped me away

406
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:35,480
 from Josiah. It's caused me to rely on a God who says, "No matter what happens, no matter

407
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,560
 the circumstances, I'm still the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow. And I'm not changing,

408
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,720
 even though that the world changes, even though there's things that come and go. I am present.

409
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:54,880
 I am the same. I am with you. I love you. I pursue you. And it's me recognizing my fallibility

410
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,360
 my sin, my weakness. And when I'm weak, the scripture says, "He's strong." And so would

411
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:05,440
 you make me more weaker, God, so that I can be filled up with a supernatural strength

412
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,560
 that doesn't look like the rest of the world so that then when they see this life, listen,

413
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,400
 they see something else outside of me. That's the heart. And listen, man, God still has

414
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:21,880
 got ground to take in my heart. But tonight he's saying, "Hey, we can have contentment

415
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,680
 and we can be okay when things are not okay, but you have to commit to thinking about the

416
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:35,240
 right things, to practicing your faith and hoping in Christ that he would meet the deepest

417
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,760
 desires of your heart." And let me pray that he would tonight. Father, only you can do

418
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:58,160
 that. No pill, no relationship, no purchase can do what only you can do. God, would you

419
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:07,760
 bring us to the end of ourself to show us that you're enough. God, there's areas in

420
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:18,880
 my own life right now that fail to believe that. And so would you do that? Would you

421
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,960
 take ground in this man and in my friends tonight for your glory, our joy, and the world's
