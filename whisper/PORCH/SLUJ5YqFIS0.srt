1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 Man, welcome everyone in the room.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,640
 And I want to welcome our Porch Live locations

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,380
 that are not tuning in online, but are here.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,060
 'Cause all of them are, or at least have people

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,440
 from each of them, specifically Porch Live Boise,

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,660
 Scottsdale, Arizona, Indianapolis,

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,100
 Greater Lafayette, North Houston,

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,220
 Des Moines, Iowa, Cincinnati, Ohio,

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,060
 Tulsa, Oklahoma, Austin, Texas,

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,980
 Midland, Texas, Fort Worth, Texas,

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,100
 and of course, Dallas, Texas.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,820
 (audience cheering)

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,740
 Hey, as you've already heard,

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,980
 this whole weekend is the theme of the rehearsal,

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,500
 that this life, according to the scriptures,

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,780
 is not the end.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,040
 As we know, as believers in Jesus,

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,220
 it is a preparation for all of eternity.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,540
 And the way that we live this life impacts our eternity

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,300
 and the eternity of others around us.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,020
 And so we just want to talk through what it looks like

22
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,340
 to live in light of that theme,

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,300
 and to be the people of God, and to live in light of that.

24
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,500
 Let me start with a story that is relevant,

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,260
 especially to anybody here,

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,260
 or everybody here who's from California.

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,980
 My family, about a month ago,

28
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,220
 got a chance to go with my in-laws.

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,820
 My wife's parents had invited us

30
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,140
 to go on a trip to California,

31
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,460
 and basically said, "If you can cover the flights

32
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,860
 "for you and the kids, we'll cover the house."

33
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,540
 So we were gonna go for a week, and it was in Malibu.

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,040
 And I've never been to Malibu.

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,300
 California people, you know it is a bougie experience,

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,740
 and it was a free place, and it's like,

37
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,260
 "Man, we're not gonna turn that down."

38
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,700
 And so I began to plan all the things that we should do,

39
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,460
 and I'm reaching out to friends, and calling people,

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,440
 and saying, "Hey, you've been there.

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,460
 "Tell me what we should do.

42
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,540
 "Tell me what we need to see.

43
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,220
 "Tell me the things that are not that great,

44
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,540
 "and everyone thinks you should, but you should avoid that."

45
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,060
 And I just began to plan and think through,

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,620
 how do we maximize our time there,

47
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,220
 and how do we prioritize?

48
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,660
 We're gonna go to the beach every single day,

49
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,660
 because there's things, you can go shopping in Dallas.

50
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,900
 You can't go to the beach in Dallas.

51
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,380
 We're going to the beach every single day.

52
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,660
 How do we maximize just what's gonna be available?

53
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,100
 Dallas Cowboys were doing their training camp,

54
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,460
 so of course, it's like, "Man, we're gonna go load up,

55
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,260
 "drive, go see the Dallas Cowboys training camp."

56
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,260
 And my focus throughout the trip,

57
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,020
 thank you, there you go, get a voice.

58
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,780
 My focus throughout the trip was really two things.

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,900
 It was, man, how do we maximize my agenda,

60
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,540
 and things that would be fun for our family,

61
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,940
 and take advantage of this short time period

62
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,500
 that we have here, and if I'm being honest,

63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,140
 kind of our own comfort, because you're on vacation, right?

64
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,700
 And so you wanna make sure that you get to sleep

65
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,620
 as long as possible, you're resting as long as possible.

66
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,420
 And when you have little kids,

67
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,620
 that's a really challenging thing to do,

68
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,860
 in particular, if they're sleeping in the same room with you.

69
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,700
 And they were, and I feel like I cracked the code

70
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,460
 on how to do this well, so this is free advice

71
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,620
 for a little bit down the road.

72
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,980
 Whenever you have kids, and you travel,

73
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,380
 and they're staying in the same hotel,

74
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,020
 or you travel, and they're staying in the same room

75
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,340
 with you inside of the house,

76
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,060
 I feel like I've figured it out, okay?

77
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,100
 First day, we go, we sleep, and I'm like, man,

78
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,420
 just, you know, the problem is they go to bed earlier,

79
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,180
 and so any restful experience of you trying to get in bed,

80
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,580
 and go to bed, and turn on the light, and brush your teeth,

81
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,940
 it just immediately wakes them up,

82
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,500
 and just ruins the whole thing.

83
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,540
 So after one night of that, it hit me.

84
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,060
 The Spirit of God spoke to me.

85
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,040
 And he said, no, I don't think this was the Spirit of God.

86
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,680
 I should go buy a tent.

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,560
 I'm gonna buy a tent, and put it in the room,

88
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,560
 and make it like a camping experience for them,

89
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,120
 and they'll love it, and we'll be able to, you know,

90
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,500
 like, turn on the light, and brush our teeth,

91
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,080
 and have a merry time together, and it'll be great.

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,280
 And so I went and bought a tent, that just set it up,

93
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,960
 and hey, you guys are gonna get to hang out in this tent,

94
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,640
 and they loved it, and we loved it, and it was just great.

95
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,760
 That was one after one example of just like,

96
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,760
 how do we maximize and have just comfort here?

97
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,360
 How do we work in with the grandparents,

98
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,960
 get a date night, make sure that we go,

99
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,600
 and eat the best seafood, and just have an amazing time?

100
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,240
 Now, what does that have to do with heaven and eternity?

101
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,040
 Well, when you think about it, that idea of,

102
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,160
 hey, I don't know how long we're gonna have here,

103
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,920
 or we have a limited amount of time here,

104
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,480
 I wanna focus on my agenda, doing, and accomplishing,

105
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,960
 and having the experiences that I want,

106
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,520
 and my comfort is how a lot of us,

107
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,160
 and a lot of people live life.

108
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,300
 Hey, I don't know what all life has for me,

109
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,640
 but I hope it has, that I drive a certain car,

110
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,280
 I hope I make a certain amount of money,

111
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,120
 I wanna build my business, and I wanna be successful,

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,080
 and I wanna have as much of my own agenda,

113
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,140
 and my experiences, and I wanna have the vacation,

114
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,160
 and Bora Bora, and check off the bucket list,

115
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,480
 and I wanna have all the different things

116
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,720
 that I want inside of my life,

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
 and I wanna have my own comfort,

118
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,400
 that I wanna spend and devote my life,

119
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,160
 and accomplish, and be successful enough,

120
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,160
 or marry the right person to have the type of comfort

121
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,740
 in life that I want,

122
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,500
 and where that becomes tragic is as Christians,

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,900
 the Bible teaches that if you devote your life

124
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,860
 to pursuing your own agenda,

125
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,580
 and your own comfort, at the exclusion of God's will,

126
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,420
 you've wasted your life,

127
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,120
 and part of the reason is because as believers,

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,460
 and I can't spend long here,

129
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,100
 but the Bible teaches that you and I

130
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,380
 are gonna spend eternity not in like fluffy clouds,

131
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,340
 like those balloons out there for all of eternity,

132
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,980
 but on this earth, in Revelation chapter 21,

133
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,180
 it says God will create a new heavens, and a new earth,

134
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,140
 he will renew the planet that we are on,

135
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,060
 so you don't have to worry about,

136
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,100
 man, I've never gone to Maui,

137
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,180
 I've gotta make sure that I do that before I die,

138
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,780
 you'll have all of eternity, billions of years,

139
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,100
 to go to an even better version of Maui,

140
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,340
 or whatever that's gonna look like,

141
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,260
 you don't have to worry about backpacking through Europe

142
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,500
 before you reach some certain age,

143
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,440
 because if you're a follower of Jesus,

144
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,320
 and I'm not saying that either of those are bad things,

145
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,060
 but you will have all of eternity,

146
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,660
 to experience a world, and a new creation,

147
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,660
 that God has made,

148
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,160
 and what I wanna attempt to do,

149
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,240
 and really the whole weekend we wanna attempt to do,

150
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,240
 is paint a vision for how do you live in light of eternity,

151
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,680
 what does it look like to live this life,

152
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,040
 in light of the next,

153
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,400
 and let me just show my cards up front,

154
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,160
 here's the challenge of this message,

155
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,360
 and why it's not gonna break through to some of you,

156
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,540
 because every message that you hear,

157
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,840
 every day, from friends, from family, from people,

158
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,280
 is that you should spend your life,

159
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,540
 focusing on your agenda, and accomplishing things,

160
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,160
 and being successful in your own comfort,

161
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,880
 and that can come by way of subtle messages,

162
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,720
 like honey, you gotta make sure

163
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,920
 that you save enough for retirement,

164
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,020
 as though the ultimate goal of life

165
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,640
 is being able to retire at some certain age,

166
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,020
 it can come like honey, you need to make sure

167
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,200
 that you have the right job, you get in the right career,

168
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,520
 because you need to provide for yourself,

169
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,400
 and every message that you're bombarded with,

170
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,320
 is you should focus on you,

171
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,640
 and the paradox of the Christian life,

172
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,880
 is that when you focus on you,

173
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,320
 you end up wasting your life,

174
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,720
 and as believers, we've been given certain invitations

175
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,680
 by God on how to steward the time,

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,420
 and the life that we have, in light of eternity,

177
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,160
 and I wanna walk through three of those things,

178
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,280
 from 1 Peter chapter four, so if you have a Bible,

179
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,720
 you can flip over to 1 Peter chapter four,

180
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,760
 verses seven through 11,

181
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,080
 if not, it'll be on the screens,

182
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,760
 and if you don't have a Bible in general,

183
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,840
 we have some at the Welcome Center,

184
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,960
 which is right outside of these doors,

185
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,640
 we'd love to give you a Bible

186
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,440
 that you can pick up at any point throughout the weekend,

187
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,920
 but in this passage, written by the Apostle Peter,

188
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,220
 he's gonna speak directly to, in light of eternity,

189
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,840
 in light of the fact that this life is limited,

190
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,140
 how should we live, and he's gonna lay out three things,

191
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,960
 now, here's the background on Peter,

192
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,040
 Peter was the leader of the disciples,

193
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,560
 Peter spent three years walking with Jesus,

194
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,560
 Peter was the disciple who stood next to the empty tomb

195
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,280
 with the Apostle John,

196
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,960
 he was a disciple that battled with some cowardice

197
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,120
 at certain points in his life,

198
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,000
 but after seeing the resurrection,

199
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
 would eventually become so courageous

200
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,120
 that he would give his own life for Christ,

201
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,600
 to the point of being crucified upside down,

202
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,040
 church history tells us,

203
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,360
 and he writes this letter in 1 Peter,

204
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,880
 and he's writing on, hey, here's how you should think,

205
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,760
 and here's how you should live,

206
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,160
 in light of the resurrection and in light of eternity,

207
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,600
 and I wanna walk through three things,

208
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,340
 starting in verse seven, that he says,

209
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,920
 that lay out how you and I are to think about this life.

210
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,760
 Verse seven,

211
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,720
 "The end of all things is near."

212
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,820
 Now, immediately, there's a problem with this statement,

213
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,800
 because he wrote it 2,000 years ago,

214
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,600
 so was he wrong, or what is he saying?

215
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,120
 The Bible says that you and I live

216
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,200
 in what's called the last days,

217
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,720
 and the last days are defined by the time

218
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,740
 between the first arrival of Jesus,

219
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,480
 when Jesus showed up originally,

220
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,600
 and the second return of Christ,

221
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,280
 and in comparison to all of eternity

222
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,320
 and billions and billions and billions of years,

223
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,640
 we are, in essence, in the last days,

224
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,960
 and Peter is saying, in light of the fact

225
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,280
 that eternity is real and more near than you realize,

226
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,560
 here's how you and I are to live,

227
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,640
 and he lays out some really interesting invitations,

228
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,320
 telling us, hey, you don't need to live

229
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,340
 focused on accomplishing your bucket list.

230
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,980
 This is how you should live in light

231
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,540
 of the reality of eternity, and he says,

232
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,440
 "So be alert and be of sober mind,

233
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,280
 "so that you may pray."

234
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,400
 First thing I wanna talk about is, he says,

235
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,360
 you need to allow the reality of eternity

236
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,900
 and the fact that the end is near

237
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,840
 to give you a perspective to pray rightly.

238
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,880
 The first idea I wanna talk about

239
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,720
 is praying with the right perspective,

240
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,840
 praying with the right perspective,

241
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,160
 'cause that's a really interesting thing.

242
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,280
 The end of all things is here, so pray.

243
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,120
 Make sure you know that so it informs

244
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,060
 that you would pray rightly.

245
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,320
 Why would he say that?

246
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,760
 It's a really interesting thing

247
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,320
 when you're confronted with the reality

248
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,860
 of being near the end of your life, it does something.

249
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,580
 It gives you a fresh perspective or a right perspective.

250
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,420
 It puts things into perspective.

251
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,260
 In June of 2007, Steve Jobs introduced

252
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,100
 something called the iPhone,

253
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,520
 and this phone that he introduced

254
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,460
 had a lot of criticism around it,

255
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,460
 and people thought, man, that'll never catch on,

256
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,280
 and the Razr phone is free,

257
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,980
 and in a very short amount of time,

258
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,780
 it spread like wildfire.

259
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,100
 It captured a majority of the market.

260
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,780
 It was crazy, transformed so much of how we live,

261
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,380
 changed the world in many ways,

262
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,980
 and 52 months later, Steve Jobs was buried and died,

263
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,180
 and in the weeks leading up to his death,

264
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,620
 there were a circulation of some writings,

265
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,340
 or there was some writings that circulated after his death

266
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,940
 that were written and attributed to him

267
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,060
 from the weeks before he died,

268
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,260
 and they're pretty profound to hear.

269
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,620
 Steve, as far as I know and as far as research would have,

270
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,740
 didn't have a relationship with the Lord,

271
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,380
 but the fact that the end was near

272
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,560
 put things into perspective, and he says this.

273
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,660
 "I have reached the pinnacle of success

274
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,320
 "in the business world.

275
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,020
 "In others' eyes, my life is the epitome of success.

276
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,780
 "However, aside from my work, I have little joy.

277
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,600
 "In the end, my wealth is only a fact of life

278
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,740
 "that I'm accustomed to.

279
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,040
 "At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life,

280
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,500
 "I realize that all the recognition and wealth

281
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,860
 "that I took so much pride in have paled

282
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,300
 "and become meaningless in the face of my death.

283
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,760
 "Treasure love for your family, love for your spouse,

284
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,360
 "love for your friends, treat yourself well,

285
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,340
 "cherish others.

286
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,640
 "As we grow older and hopefully wiser,

287
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,060
 "we realize that a $3,000 or a $30 watch

288
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,080
 "both tell the same time.

289
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,280
 "You will realize that true inner happiness

290
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,420
 "doesn't come from material things in this world.

291
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,360
 "Whether you fly first class or economy,

292
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,360
 "if the plane goes down, you go down with it."

293
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,920
 But there's something about the end in mind

294
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,040
 and knowing that and believing that and embracing that,

295
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,940
 it just puts things into perspective.

296
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,720
 And Peter is saying, "The end is near.

297
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,280
 "Eternity is real."

298
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,400
 And so live in light of that and allow that

299
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,360
 to shape the way that you pray,

300
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,680
 to impact the things that you focus on,

301
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,760
 to pray rightly, asking for God's will.

302
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,740
 So often in life, we think of prayer like,

303
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,840
 which is just talking to God,

304
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,860
 but we think of it like room service.

305
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,520
 What's room service?

306
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,320
 Room service, you know, you're at the hotel

307
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,360
 and you find yourself hungry and you're like,

308
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,560
 "Oh, I'm gonna call down and order one of those pizzas

309
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,980
 "for $87 or I'm gonna ask them if they have another blanket

310
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,640
 "'cause it's too cold in my room or I need another pillow

311
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,240
 "and I just occasionally will call

312
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,740
 "based on things that I want."

313
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,160
 And the picture painted in scripture

314
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,920
 of what prayer is like for believers

315
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,920
 is not room service, but it's like a walkie talkie

316
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,080
 a soldier uses while walking in the battle

317
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,920
 that I'm in constant communication

318
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,520
 with the commander and his intent.

319
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,840
 That you and I are to be on constant alert to say,

320
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,560
 "God, what would you have me do in this situation?

321
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,040
 "I'm walking into work and I'm anxious over that coworker

322
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,120
 "and how they're gonna treat me.

323
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,620
 "And God, would you help me to know

324
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,840
 "how to love them in this moment?

325
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,900
 "God, you know that I'm headed over to see a family member

326
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,300
 "and they've been so hurtful for me

327
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,460
 "and so I'm in constant communication.

328
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,420
 "God, will you help me to love

329
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,500
 "like you would have me love them?

330
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,520
 "God, I don't wanna forgive them,

331
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,540
 "but will you help me to have the strength to forgive them?

332
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,800
 "That I'm constantly in communication with God.

333
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
 "God, I'm gonna be tempted in this scenario

334
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,240
 "to lust after that billboard

335
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,840
 "that I know that I drive by every single day.

336
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,280
 "God, will you help me to have the strength

337
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,520
 "to fight this temptation?

338
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,340
 "I'm in constant communication with God

339
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,500
 "for his will, for his agenda.

340
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,380
 "God, will you help me?

341
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,680
 "I'm an introvert, so whenever I go to places

342
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,100
 "and I wanna look for times to share my faith,

343
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,640
 "I just find myself, I'm so uncomfortable

344
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,600
 "and I don't know how to do this.

345
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
 "God, will you help me?

346
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,200
 "And will you give me the words,

347
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
 "give me the clarity

348
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,620
 "that I'd have the ability to share my faith?"

349
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,960
 And Peter is saying, "This life is short.

350
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,100
 "And your perspective is gonna shape what you focus on.

351
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,780
 "And you focus, and what you focus on

352
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,960
 "is gonna shape your prayers.

353
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,140
 "And you and I have an invitation to use prayer

354
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,260
 "and to spend our life focused on God's agenda

355
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,260
 "and God's kingdom, or to waste it by focusing on our own."

356
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,640
 It's funny how perspective,

357
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,680
 it really does change what you focus on.

358
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,840
 When I was in Malibu at that house,

359
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,180
 like, man, it was a cool house,

360
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,200
 but there were some things that, you know,

361
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,720
 it's just a little bit like,

362
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,600
 kind of too modern for my vibe.

363
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,360
 The couch, I wasn't crazy about it,

364
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,360
 but just some furniture I didn't particularly love.

365
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,140
 You know what never crossed my mind when I was there?

366
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,020
 I was there for five days.

367
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,360
 It never crossed my mind to go,

368
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,220
 "You know what, I'm done.

369
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,260
 "This couch, it's out.

370
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,600
 "I'm going to rooms to go

371
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,960
 "and I'm getting a new couch in here

372
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,080
 "because I just can't live with this anymore."

373
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,920
 Why?

374
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,400
 Because I knew that wasn't my home.

375
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,600
 I wasn't staying there.

376
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,200
 And that perspective and the reality of eternity,

377
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,320
 it allows us to live this life knowing,

378
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,120
 man, I don't have to solely focus.

379
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,040
 I don't have to focus on me accumulating

380
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,560
 or me accomplishing.

381
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,400
 God, I can focus on you and your agenda.

382
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,720
 'Cause here's the saddest thing.

383
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,000
 When I said Steve Jobs changed the world,

384
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,440
 in a billion years, in eternity and in heaven,

385
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,200
 no one will be thinking about Steve Jobs

386
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,480
 and his impact through the iPhone.

387
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,320
 No one.

388
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,280
 And this world would say,

389
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,520
 "Man, that was an amazing accomplishment."

390
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,520
 In a billion years, what people will be thinking of

391
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,400
 is the person who came to faith in Christ

392
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,680
 at your office place, in your apartment complex,

393
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,200
 where you live and your family,

394
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,240
 because you shared the gospel with them.

395
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
 And Peter is saying, "Man, don't lose heart.

396
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,760
 "Don't lose perspective.

397
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,040
 "Don't focus on this life.

398
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,440
 "Every message is going to come at you like,

399
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,380
 "'Hey, live for you, live for you, focus on you,'

400
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,960
 "and it's going to lead you to not see the bigger picture

401
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,280
 "and ask God to move inside of your life."

402
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,680
 Here's something you probably have never thought about.

403
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,480
 You know, there's going to come a day

404
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,880
 where you will never be able to pray again.

405
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,640
 You will never have the chance to invite God

406
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,520
 to move in a broken world

407
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,020
 and in the places and spaces that you live,

408
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,000
 because you'll be fully in the presence of God

409
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,700
 and you'll never have the opportunity to speak to him.

410
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,300
 And not only is prayer a chance for you to say,

411
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,140
 "God, will you help me?

412
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,240
 "I want to be on mission for you,"

413
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,260
 or, "God, help me right now,

414
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,100
 "because I honestly don't want to be on mission for you."

415
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,640
 It's also something that just grows

416
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,220
 our relationship with God, the more and more that we do it.

417
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,600
 It almost raises our just God awareness in our life.

418
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,160
 My wife, when we dated in college,

419
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,940
 she spent a summer in Spain,

420
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,940
 and this was before iPhones or FaceTime or any of that.

421
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,740
 And I remember that because there was a time difference,

422
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,040
 I would just go out of my way to prioritize

423
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,400
 if she was available to call.

424
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,320
 So she would call at three in the afternoon,

425
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,480
 and it's like two in the morning over here,

426
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,520
 and I'm like, "Hey, how are you?

427
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,360
 "How are you?"

428
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,980
 And I looked forward to those phone calls every single time.

429
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,320
 And we would talk,

430
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,300
 and I don't even remember anything that we talked about.

431
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,500
 I just remember constantly,

432
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,700
 even though I knew I was gonna see her soon,

433
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,200
 the desire to have that communication,

434
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,540
 it just strengthened our relationship.

435
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,040
 And the picture scripture gives us is,

436
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,320
 man, prayer is this invitation

437
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,560
 to invite God into your world,

438
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,800
 invite him to move,

439
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,640
 to set our minds on things that actually matter.

440
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,200
 And in the process,

441
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,000
 it strengthens our relationship along the way.

442
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,980
 And Peter says, "Hey, in light of the fact

443
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,340
 "that eternity is real,

444
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,120
 "pray with the right perspective."

445
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,640
 God wants to move.

446
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,080
 Invite him in your life.

447
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,360
 The number of prayers that you have left in life,

448
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,540
 it is limited.

449
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,200
 But don't let it be limited by time.

450
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,200
 Let it be limited by you.

451
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,880
 Or let it be limited by time,

452
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,320
 not let it be limited by you.

453
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,520
 And then he moves into a second thing.

454
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,080
 "In light of eternity, the end is near.

455
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
 "Here's how you should live."

456
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,420
 And he says this,

457
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,880
 "Above all,

458
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,160
 "love each other deeply."

459
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,320
 Or your translation may say strenuously or fervently.

460
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,360
 Because love covers a multitude of sins.

461
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,000
 "Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling."

462
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,720
 Says, "Above everything else."

463
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,040
 Here's another thing, "In light of eternity,

464
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,680
 "love each other deeply."

465
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,520
 Or the second idea is to love beyond your limits.

466
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,360
 Why do I say that?

467
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,680
 Well, the Greek word for deeply

468
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,220
 is the Greek word ektinos.

469
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,880
 It's a word that literally means strenuously.

470
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,460
 It was a word that was associated with Greek runners

471
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,840
 when they would cross a finish line at the Olympics

472
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,120
 and they would strain and stretch forward.

473
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,360
 And Paul says, "When it comes to love,

474
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,980
 "I want you to stretch the boundaries

475
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,520
 "and the limits of your love towards other people.

476
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,900
 "I want you to love people in a way

477
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,120
 "that stretches beyond what is comfortable."

478
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,080
 What does that even mean?

479
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,440
 Or how does that look like in my life?

480
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,200
 This is loving when it's not easy.

481
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,580
 And he's saying, "Hey, you wanna live in light of eternity,

482
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,240
 "be someone who is marked with the birthmark of Christianity."

483
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,560
 Which is what Jesus says.

484
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,480
 Christians are marked by love.

485
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,880
 "But do so in a way that stretches when it's hard,

486
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,720
 "with a coworker who's not a believer

487
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,120
 "and candidly they treat you poorly.

488
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,260
 "With a family member or the sibling

489
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,980
 "who mocks you for your faith."

490
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,020
 He's saying even that person in the face of whatever it is,

491
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,060
 even when it's not easy,

492
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,940
 'cause that's the only way that you can have a love

493
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,140
 that is stretching beyond what's comfortable.

494
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,740
 It's easy to love people and they love us back.

495
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,100
 And he's saying, "Be marked by love at all times

496
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,220
 "and love even when it is not comfortable.

497
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,720
 "Go beyond the limits and the boundaries."

498
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,460
 I was thinking about just how convicting that is

499
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,560
 for me personally in my own life,

500
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,760
 of just saying, "God, will you help me

501
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,940
 "to stretch the boundaries of the way that I love people,

502
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,720
 "hard and easy inside of my life."

503
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,060
 And in particular, I was thinking of a friend on my team.

504
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,420
 He was up here earlier, Josiah.

505
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,420
 And just the ways that he loves people.

506
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,020
 I'm so challenged and encouraged by seeing someone

507
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,020
 who even when they're exhausted or pushed is just saying,

508
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,420
 "Man, I'm gonna love this person beyond the limits

509
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,660
 "of what I may feel right now, even when it's not easy."

510
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,340
 The Greek word for love here is a really interesting one.

511
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,940
 I don't have really a lot of time to go into it,

512
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,500
 but it's a Greek word for agape.

513
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,340
 And if you're a Christian,

514
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,660
 you've probably heard that word before,

515
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,060
 but here's what makes agape love different.

516
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,740
 So in Greek, which is what the New Testament was written in,

517
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,660
 they had these different words for love.

518
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,200
 Each of them had slight differences.

519
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,200
 There was words that had emotional love.

520
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,660
 It would be like, man, a friendship or a romantic person

521
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,540
 that you were moved to love.

522
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,420
 Agape love was different.

523
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,820
 It wasn't emotional.

524
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,580
 It was volitional.

525
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,940
 It was a decision.

526
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,940
 That it was a form of love that didn't act based on feeling

527
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,700
 and act based on undeciding.

528
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,540
 And the perfect example of agape love

529
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,420
 was Christ going on the cross, not saying,

530
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,260
 "Man, I feel like I really want to be crucified,"

531
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,180
 but saying, "I am making the decision to sacrificially love

532
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,020
 "and lay down my life for other people."

533
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,260
 And Paul says, "You and I are to be marked

534
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,300
 "by that agape love."

535
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,700
 What else is interesting, and again,

536
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,220
 I don't have a ton of time.

537
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,700
 The Greek word agape love,

538
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,940
 when you look at Greek literature,

539
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,000
 prior to the New Testament being written,

540
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,660
 the occasions where it described someone loving someone

541
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,580
 are unbelievably rare.

542
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,360
 It wasn't until Christians showed up on the scene

543
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,580
 and the world looked, and it's like they were marked

544
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,260
 by this radical, deciding love to choose to sacrifice

545
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,860
 for the good and benefit of other people.

546
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,980
 And they began to associate it with Christians

547
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,540
 and Christianity in particular.

548
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,160
 Tertullian, who was an early church father and writer,

549
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,660
 even remarked of how one of the highest criticisms

550
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,940
 or constant criticisms was that these Christians

551
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,620
 were so marked by love.

552
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,520
 It said, this is from Apologeticus, chapter 39.

553
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,740
 "What marks us in the eyes of our enemies

554
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,220
 "is our loving kindness.

555
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,220
 "Only look, they say, look how they love one another."

556
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,820
 Peter says, "Man, if you want to be someone

557
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,700
 "who lives in light of eternity, love others,

558
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,600
 "and love in a way that is beyond the boundaries

559
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,140
 "of what's comfortable and easy."

560
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,620
 And he says, "When you do so, it covers a multitude of sins.

561
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,580
 "It is a love that is covering."

562
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,260
 And he quotes from Proverbs, chapter 12,

563
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,180
 which is a verse of love covering a multitude of sins.

564
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,520
 But it's a love that's saying,

565
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,760
 "Because I love you," or it's a love that's not saying,

566
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,880
 "Hey, because I love you, I'm gonna see your faults

567
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,720
 "and I'm gonna decide those aren't even faults anymore."

568
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,600
 No, it's saying, "I'm gonna love you and I see your faults

569
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,980
 "and they're still faults, but I'm choosing to love you."

570
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,860
 It's not embracing sin, it's saying,

571
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,180
 "I'm gonna choose to love you."

572
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,720
 Despite your sin and despite my sin,

573
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,260
 I'm gonna choose to cover and care about you.

574
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,540
 And then he brings up hospitality,

575
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,600
 and hospitality feels like a random term,

576
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,420
 but hospitality is the New Testament word

577
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,460
 that literally means to love a stranger.

578
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,340
 So he says, "Man, love those who are around you,

579
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,540
 "love beyond limits, and stretch your love

580
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,340
 "even when it's hard, and love strangers

581
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,200
 "and people that God puts in your path."

582
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,280
 What if it's true that God has you where you work,

583
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,140
 where you're sitting right now,

584
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,440
 where you're gonna sit on the plane ride home,

585
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,960
 where you're gonna stop later for food in the morning?

586
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,720
 Like he's put you there to be an extension

587
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,580
 and expression of his love.

588
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,020
 He's put you there to care.

589
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,520
 Last week on Monday, I was going to lunch with Sam,

590
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,220
 who's the director of this conference,

591
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,720
 and just crushed it, we'll celebrate him

592
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,680
 just all the ways that he's been behind everything,

593
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,680
 candidly, and the amazing theme that he leads, you see.

594
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,160
 We were going to lunch, and on the way back from lunch,

595
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,900
 we got in his car, and he went to start his car,

596
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,920
 and it just was clear, man, this is not going anywhere.

597
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,060
 And so he's like, "I think I have some jumper cables,"

598
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,280
 and he goes to the back, and he pulls out jumper cables

599
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,640
 that look like they're from World War II or something,

600
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,040
 and he's like, "Man, I think I can do something with these."

601
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,880
 And I'm like, "Man, we're at least gonna need a truck,"

602
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,880
 and I'm pretty sure that's not even jumper cables,

603
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,280
 but I look up, and right in front of me is this guy

604
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,840
 in this big truck, and I said,

605
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,940
 "Hey, do you mind giving us a jump?"

606
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,360
 And he very quickly gets out of his car,

607
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,840
 walks immediately over, takes this black bag,

608
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,120
 it looked like black velvet, it's like this big,

609
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,480
 pulls out of the back bag a black box,

610
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,520
 it's like completely shiny, it just was like,

611
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,600
 I have no idea what's about to happen.

612
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,080
 We're either about to disappear,

613
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,920
 like we're in Men in Black or something,

614
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,800
 and then he pulls these two little cables out,

615
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,800
 and Sam's holding these, again, from before time, cables,

616
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,120
 and he's like, "You're not gonna need that."

617
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,120
 And he attaches it, pushes a button,

618
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,880
 and he says, "Wait 10 seconds?

619
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,800
 "All right, turn the car on."

620
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,480
 And I'm sitting there on the phone with Josiah going,

621
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,800
 "Hey, bro, we're gonna need a ride,

622
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,640
 "I don't know if this is gonna work,

623
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,760
 "there's some guy that's here,"

624
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,040
 and I was like, "What was your name again?"

625
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,680
 "Dusty, Austin Dusty."

626
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,000
 And then he goes, "Turn the car."

627
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,320
 And started right up.

628
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,880
 And I'm like, "Okay, I gotta go,

629
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,280
 "I think I just met an angel."

630
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,120
 (audience laughing)

631
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,600
 And I'm like, "Man, hey, thank you."

632
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,840
 And he's like, "Sorry, I can't talk."

633
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,400
 And he was just like, "Thanks so much,

634
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,920
 "don't worry about it, man, I really gotta go though."

635
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,040
 And he walked off, and then he just disappeared

636
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,280
 as he walked away.

637
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,480
 (audience laughing)

638
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,120
 And it was like, that didn't happen,

639
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,200
 that's what didn't happen.

640
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,560
 (audience laughing)

641
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,200
 But it felt like, oh my gosh, what in the world,

642
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,680
 this person, just like, out of nowhere,

643
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,960
 in front of us, is there,

644
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,200
 and it felt like he was placed there to care for us.

645
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,920
 Now, I don't know any of his story,

646
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,040
 and that is really true, he quickly had to go.

647
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,680
 And I don't know if he was placed there to care,

648
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,800
 but I do know if you're a believer,

649
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,680
 you've been placed there to care.

650
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,240
 And you're the hands and feet of Christ

651
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,600
 in order to care for people around you.

652
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,400
 Which is where he goes next,

653
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,600
 and he brings up the final thing,

654
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,920
 so hey, you're gonna pray rightly,

655
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,040
 pray in light of perspective,

656
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,920
 pray and ask God to do eternal things in your life.

657
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,240
 Oh man, I'm gonna love deeply,

658
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,760
 I wanna love people and be an extension of God's love

659
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,480
 for the world around us.

660
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,160
 And then he says, "Each of you should use

661
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,640
 "whatever gift you have received,"

662
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,480
 talking about spiritual gifts,

663
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,740
 "to serve others as faithful stewards

664
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,260
 "of God's grace in various forms."

665
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,720
 If anyone speaks, they should do so

666
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,160
 as one who speaks the very words of God.

667
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,040
 If anyone serves, he brings up different gifts.

668
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,280
 They should do so with the strength God provides.

669
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,000
 "So that in all things,

670
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,340
 "God may be praised through Jesus Christ.

671
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,340
 "To him be the glory and power forever and ever, amen."

672
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,600
 So Peter lays out a number of different profound truths,

673
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,800
 but he says, hey, every Christian

674
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
 has been given a spiritual gift.

675
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,860
 Every one of you, when you trusted in Jesus,

676
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,480
 you were given by the Spirit of God,

677
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,880
 whether you realize it or not, a gift.

678
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,000
 And it's a gift that he says is given to you

679
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,120
 in order to give to other people,

680
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,680
 in order to serve other people.

681
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
 And it's a gift that when that happens,

682
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,320
 brings honor and glory to God.

683
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,200
 That's what basically he said.

684
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,160
 And he's saying, hey, use the gifts that God has given you

685
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,040
 and use them to serve other people around you.

686
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,280
 And when you do, it brings honor to the gift giver,

687
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,800
 which is God.

688
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,500
 The third idea from the text is that you and I,

689
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,140
 and we wanna live in light of eternity

690
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,020
 and live with eternity in mind.

691
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,300
 It involves serving others sacrificially,

692
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,980
 praying with the right perspective,

693
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,400
 loving others beyond our limits,

694
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,140
 and then serving others sacrificially.

695
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,940
 God has given you gifts, you,

696
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,380
 that he wants to be used and given

697
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,260
 to others in this world.

698
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,780
 Every year at Christmas,

699
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,740
 my father will send Christmas gifts to our kids

700
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,700
 and he'll send them and I'll open the package

701
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,900
 and realize, oh, these are gifts for my kids.

702
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:56,780
 If I was to take those gifts that I received

703
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,700
 and hoard them for myself and not give them to my kids,

704
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,600
 who they were to be given to, through me to them,

705
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,380
 you would think, man, that is messed up.

706
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,340
 What use do you have for a Nerf gun?

707
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,340
 What would you want with some princess doll?

708
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,700
 It just would be like, man, that's bizarre.

709
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,580
 Those are gifts given to you to be given to them.

710
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,780
 And that's the picture that scripture paints,

711
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,240
 that God has given you and I gifts.

712
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,980
 Every one of you has gifts that God has entrusted to you,

713
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,420
 spiritual gifts that he wants you to use

714
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,260
 no matter where you live,

715
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,620
 no matter what your story is.

716
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,300
 The spirit of God wants to give those gifts

717
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,220
 through you to the world around us.

718
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,980
 And in scripture, we're told,

719
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,740
 'cause we don't have a lot of time to go exhaustively

720
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,740
 into the spiritual gifts that God has given,

721
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,160
 but there's different spiritual gifts that are given,

722
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,900
 some referenced here in Romans chapter 12,

723
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,380
 it talks about prophetically speaking,

724
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,500
 serving, teaching, encouraging.

725
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,060
 Like somebody who have the gift of encouragement.

726
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,900
 And as lovingly as I can say it,

727
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,160
 like God has given you that gift

728
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,460
 so you would be an encourager to people around you.

729
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,940
 But because of just the insecurities and hurt and stuff

730
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,620
 that God wants to work through and bring healing,

731
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,260
 you're not sharing that encouragement.

732
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,900
 Because you're too focused on the pain

733
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,060
 that God wants to work through

734
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,760
 that you still want to hold on to.

735
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,980
 He expresses that there's gifts like leadership.

736
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,620
 You have a gift of giving, gift of mercy.

737
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,500
 First Corinthians 12, verse four through 11 says,

738
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,940
 "God will give people the gift of wisdom,

739
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,360
 "of intuition or knowledge, the gift of faith,

740
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,460
 "the gift of healing, the gift of discernment

741
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,940
 "and speaking foreign tongues,

742
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,060
 "the gift of helping and administration and leadership."

743
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,980
 In First Corinthians 12, 28.

744
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,140
 "I don't know what your gifts are,

745
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,280
 "but I know the Spirit of God has entrusted

746
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,460
 "and given gifts to you that he wants to be used

747
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,500
 "to build his church and his kingdom in this life."

748
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,460
 How do you know what your gifts are really quickly?

749
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,100
 A lot of times you just have to

750
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:15,280
 see which things God stirs your hearts towards.

751
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,860
 What are the things that other people affirm?

752
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,900
 Maybe you love sharing your faith

753
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,100
 and it comes naturally to you

754
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,300
 and maybe you have the gift of evangelism.

755
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,580
 Maybe you are someone who has a real gift

756
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,860
 for creating environments and caring for people

757
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,700
 and you have the gift of hospitality

758
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,460
 or the gift of serving.

759
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,620
 Maybe you're just a good communicator

760
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,380
 as it relates to helping people understand the Bible,

761
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,500
 not on a stage, maybe on a stage,

762
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,220
 but just in a small group with other people.

763
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,420
 I don't know what the gifts he's given you are,

764
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,620
 but I know that they were given

765
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,200
 so that they would be given through you

766
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,340
 to the people in the world around us.

767
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,200
 In World War II, in a small village called Strasbourg, France

768
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,560
 there was a church building

769
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,800
 that was destroyed and bombed by Nazi bombings.

770
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,160
 And after the wreckage and the rubble,

771
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,360
 they were picking up the church building.

772
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,600
 It's this small village.

773
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,920
 And inside of that church building

774
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,760
 where they began to restore all the broken walls

775
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,080
 and beams that had fallen,

776
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,100
 underneath all of it they found this statue of Jesus

777
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,580
 that was entirely, it was totally fine except one thing.

778
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,640
 Its hands had been broken off when a beam fell on it.

779
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,040
 And this is a town, they don't have a lot of churches

780
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,940
 and there's not a lot of things.

781
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,780
 So of course everyone's going,

782
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
 "Hey, what are we gonna do?

783
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,620
 "And we gotta fix that Jesus statue.

784
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,700
 "I mean, this is a big deal."

785
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,020
 And so some time went by and people are deciding,

786
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,580
 "Should we hire a sculptor to come in

787
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,900
 "and create hands that are placed on there?"

788
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,780
 And then one day people showed up in the church

789
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,100
 and on the statue of Jesus,

790
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,660
 completely there with the hands gone,

791
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,120
 there was a sign that said, "He has no hands but ours."

792
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,860
 And the truth, if you're a believer,

793
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,260
 it says you're the body of Christ.

794
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,500
 You're the closest representation of Jesus

795
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,660
 anyone in our world will ever experience.

796
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,900
 And he has no hands to serve and extend

797
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,440
 or the hands he's chosen to extend to our world

798
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,940
 is yours and mine.

799
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,100
 And he's saying, "You have spiritual gifts

800
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,080
 "that were given not to be held on by you,

801
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,540
 "but to be poured to the world around us,

802
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,380
 "that you would use the gifts that God has given you."

803
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,100
 Whether that is in leading a small group

804
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,020
 of high school kids and caring and showing up.

805
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,660
 Maybe God has given you the gift

806
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,280
 of understanding and learning,

807
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,940
 and he wants you to start something

808
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,160
 or go be a part of something

809
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,460
 in socioeconomic disadvantaged areas

810
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,780
 where you just tutor kids and you spend time to 'em

811
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,100
 and they don't have a father around,

812
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,700
 but you're pouring into 'em and you're teaching 'em math,

813
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,020
 but you're teaching 'em so much more

814
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,580
 and you're showing him your life and the gospel through it.

815
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,680
 Maybe he's calling you to start something or go serve,

816
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,600
 and there's so many different ministries represented

817
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,720
 and that are so connected and close

818
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,460
 to wherever you live inside of this room,

819
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,340
 to serve with elderly communities or at a nursing home

820
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,480
 where you go and administer

821
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,680
 to some of the loneliest people in society

822
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
 and you just show up

823
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,920
 and you don't have any relationship with them.

824
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,040
 You just say, "Man, I'm just gonna love you

825
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,780
 "and share Jesus and the gospel with you."

826
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,320
 Maybe he's calling you to go on mission

827
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,240
 and he's calling you to pick your life up

828
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,180
 and make a decision to change where you live.

829
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,020
 Maybe he's not.

830
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,780
 Maybe he's calling you to start a Bible study

831
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,460
 in your business or company or the office that you're at.

832
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,600
 I don't know what he's calling you to do.

833
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,140
 I know that he has been given or he has given you gifts

834
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,360
 and he has called you to use those

835
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,960
 because he has no hands but yours.

836
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,380
 And Peter says, "If you wanna live in light of eternity,

837
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,700
 "you take those gifts that God uniquely gave you

838
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,480
 "and you use them for his glory."

839
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,680
 And here's where this becomes really important.

840
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,900
 There's something, there's a paradox of the Christian life

841
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,580
 that the more that I focus on myself

842
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,300
 and I focus on using my gifts and my time and my talents

843
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,160
 and my energy to build my kingdom and accomplish my agenda

844
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,280
 and set up my comfort, I lose my life.

845
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,160
 The Bible says the more that you try to hold

846
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,700
 and gain your life, you lose it.

847
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,860
 But the more that you lose your life for his sake,

848
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,380
 you find it.

849
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,180
 And the reason why oftentimes

850
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,420
 we can find ourselves so depressed and in such a bad place

851
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,100
 is because the focus and constant goal of your life

852
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,020
 is all about you.

853
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,340
 It's not about serving other people.

854
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,420
 And you know what happens when all you do is take in,

855
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,020
 take in, take in, and you go to church,

856
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,180
 you listen to the PORCH podcast,

857
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,260
 you listen to Views from the Porch,

858
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,800
 you listen to other podcast places,

859
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,300
 you take in, you take in, but you never pour out.

860
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,980
 Spiritually, you begin to die.

861
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,020
 It's a law of nature, but it's also a law of reality.

862
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,660
 If I said everybody in the room,

863
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,100
 just breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe in,

864
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,920
 and you never breathe out, you die.

865
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,820
 The Dead Sea is a sea that you've probably heard referenced

866
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,140
 in the Bible, and it's a sea that's near

867
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,980
 in the places that Jesus lived,

868
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,740
 and there's beauty all around it.

869
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,740
 But there's something crazy about the Dead Sea.

870
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,100
 Everything that is in it is dead,

871
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,300
 because it's a sea that has only water and rivers

872
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,220
 that flow into it, but never flow out of it.

873
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,540
 And so if you only take in, and you only receive,

874
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,220
 and you never pour out, you die.

875
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,960
 And for your own growth, spiritual health,

876
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,260
 experiencing serving others is a means

877
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,940
 by which you can experience more

878
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,060
 of the abundant life God wants you to have.

879
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,200
 And the more that you resist that or refuse to do that,

880
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,740
 you're not gonna experience spiritual growth,

881
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,780
 but spiritual death.

882
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,960
 And I don't mean for eternity,

883
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,340
 I mean you're just not gonna experience

884
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,900
 the abundant life that God wants you to experience.

885
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,140
 Peter says, "But you can,

886
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,180
 "but it involves serving sacrificially."

887
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,220
 Maybe just last thing, and then I'll wrap up.

888
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,380
 Maybe the most important application

889
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,040
 some of you can make is when you leave this conference,

890
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,740
 you're gonna call or text your pastor,

891
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,260
 you're gonna call or text a ministry leader,

892
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,540
 you're gonna call or text somebody and just say,

893
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,860
 "Hey, I don't know how to serve, but I need to serve.

894
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,080
 "How can I serve?

895
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,100
 "How can I help?

896
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,120
 "What can I do?

897
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,020
 "How can I be a part of what God is doing?

898
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,140
 "I want to serve and be a part of reaching people for Jesus

899
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,740
 "with the short amount of time in life that I have."

900
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,420
 In conclusion, if you wanna live in light of eternity,

901
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,100
 Peter says it involves, you're gonna pray in perspective.

902
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,920
 You're going to love other people deeply,

903
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,260
 and then you're gonna serve others sacrificially.

904
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,100
 Let me close with this.

905
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,980
 I'm gonna invite the band to come up,

906
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,420
 and probably should have given them more of a heads up,

907
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,260
 but they're coming out, here they are.

908
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,220
 And let me tell you a little bit about this band.

909
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,780
 So let me introduce, especially,

910
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,040
 'cause a lot of us in the room,

911
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,540
 in fact, most of us in the room,

912
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:45,180
 are not from Texas, let alone from Dallas,

913
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,220
 and probably are not familiar with the band that is here.

914
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,900
 So each one of these guys plays a specific role,

915
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,220
 plays a different part.

916
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,660
 We've got J-Rob, where's Hayden?

917
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,580
 Hayden?

918
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,900
 You got J-Rob over here playing drums.

919
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,980
 Then we've got Esteban over here playing bass.

920
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,500
 (audience cheering)

921
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,580
 Sam, and, oh, you're over there.

922
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,220
 You've been there the whole time.

923
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,660
 Man.

924
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,060
 Sam and Adam Prince on the keys.

925
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,900
 We don't have just one,

926
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,320
 we have two piano players for this weekend.

927
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,980
 And we have Jake and Wellington playing on the guitar.

928
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,500
 They're gonna play a song here in a second,

929
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,100
 but let me say this, I love this band.

930
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,660
 It is like one of the greatest privileges

931
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,980
 to get to sit and worship with them,

932
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,440
 and I love them even more as people.

933
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,080
 But as a band, each one of them plays a specific role.

934
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,700
 So y'all start playing a song,

935
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,540
 and each of them plays a different instrument,

936
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,580
 and their instrument, they do different things with.

937
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,020
 So some are plucking strings,

938
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,020
 some are hitting, you know, ivories,

939
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,920
 some are singing songs.

940
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,280
 Each of them plays different roles.

941
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,580
 Now here's what happens if a couple of them,

942
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,460
 as they're all collectively coming together,

943
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,180
 and they're playing this one song,

944
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,980
 and it sounds amazing, and it sounds with purpose and beauty,

945
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
 you take out a couple of them,

946
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,940
 say, "J-Rob, stop playing.

947
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,200
 "Jake, stop playing.

948
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,460
 "Wellington, stop playing."

949
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:09,080
 All of the beauty, and what was, and potential,

950
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,800
 you take out a couple of people not playing their role,

951
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,100
 not using their gifts,

952
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,340
 not playing their instrument, so to speak,

953
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:20,000
 and what could have been no longer is.

954
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,220
 Not only that, if you all play together again,

955
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,500
 if you have a couple of them that decide,

956
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,220
 "You know what, we're gonna play this song,

957
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,680
 "but you know, I don't like that song.

958
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,320
 "I wanna use my gifts to do what I wanna do.

959
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,740
 "I wanna play the instrument I wanna play."

960
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,180
 And you have the keys, or you have the electric guitars

961
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,300
 play a different song than everybody else.

962
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,340
 Notice.

963
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,700
 All right, that's enough.

964
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,100
 It's not just not reaching its full potential.

965
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,660
 It's worse.

966
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,840
 It's confusing.

967
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,360
 It's, listen, it's distracting.

968
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,060
 And it doesn't come off as appealing and attractive.

969
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,580
 Could it be as simple as this?

970
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,780
 God has given you gifts and a life,

971
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,100
 and through that life, he wants to use those gifts

972
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,220
 to join with others with different gifts

973
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,980
 and building the kingdom of God,

974
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,900
 and you have the decision,

975
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,020
 "Am I gonna sit out and rob the church

976
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,440
 "of the potential it has,

977
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,140
 "or am I gonna play a different song, not God's song?

978
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,340
 "I'm gonna play my song 'cause I wanna live my song,"

979
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,140
 and be distracting to the world who looks to your life,

980
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,380
 who claims to be a Christian,

981
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,940
 and you got the bio,

982
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,940
 you have a verse in your Instagram bio,

983
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,020
 "But you do not sing the song of heaven

984
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,500
 "with your life and how you think and how you live,"

985
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,820
 and it's distracting, and it's confusing.

986
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,300
 And I don't say that out of anything other than love for you

987
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,020
 'cause all I want and I'll hold hope through this conference

988
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,100
 is that you would live in light of eternity.

989
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,180
 The end is near.

990
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,280
 God is real.

991
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,340
 You have purpose.

992
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,780
 He placed you here with gifts.

993
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,180
 He placed you here for a reason,

994
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,860
 where you live, who you're around,

995
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,860
 and he wants to see you experience abundant life

996
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,340
 by praying and inviting him for eternal things,

997
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,780
 loving people beyond what is easy

998
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,340
 and the limits that you feel,

999
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,180
 and by serving like he did sacrificially on the cross,

1000
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,780
 and in so doing, you experience life.

1001
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,660
 Let me pray.

1002
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,580
 Father, I thank you for every person here,

1003
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,820
 and God, we confess,

1004
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:33,420
 there are constant things fighting for our attention.

1005
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,740
 There are constant ways that we have the world saying,

1006
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,740
 sing this song, not the song of the savior of the world,

1007
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,780
 the good news of Jesus.

1008
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,660
 Focus on yourself,

1009
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,820
 and we ask for your help.

1010
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,660
 I pray that you would move us to be more like Jesus,

1011
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,780
 who served sacrificially, loved beyond any limit,

1012
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,660
 and who constantly lived from the right perspective.

1013
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,940
 Father, would you take our lives

1014
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:15,940
 and do supernatural serving through them,

1015
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,620
 that you have no hands but ours,

1016
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,660
 and so we just say, God, use our life.

1017
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,780
 Save us from living for this world,

1018
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,820
 and help us by your spirit.

1019
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:37,380
 In the name of your son, our savior, Jesus, amen.

1020
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,740
