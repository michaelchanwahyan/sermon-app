1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 So my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 [Music]

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hey, it doesn't get more real than that. And speaking of real, that's actually a perfect segue because

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 we're about to get super real in this place because we are talking about the divided states of America.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And do you guys mind if I just let you kind of in to my time with God the last couple of weeks?

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I don't want to sound super holy, but do y'all mind? Is that okay? Okay, thank you.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 So if you would have told me, "Hey, JD, you're going to be standing in front of a bunch of your friends

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 that are your age, and you're going to be speaking on the topic of racial reconciliation and the issue of racism

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 in our culture today, a week before the election, possibly one of the most important elections

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 in the history of our nation in 2020, I would have actually called you insane. Like, insane.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And not only that, but that's not just lip service, guys. I would have ran for the hills and said,

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 "No way, no how, you're not getting me up there," because I, to my core, if I'm being completely honest,

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I have this internal struggle of this thing called people-pleasing. Ever heard of it? Anyone out there?

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And I also have another struggle with this thing called perfectionism. Ever heard of it? Yeah, okay.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And when presented with the opportunity to talk about something that could potentially be so divisive,

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 and there are so many mixed opinions, and there are so many different things that inform this conversation,

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 and let's not even, you know, forget the fact that I am also white, I'm a male, I'm a Christian,

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 and there's a lot of different things that make me, right from the bat, at hearing the opportunity to share on this topic,

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 feel disqualified, feel insecure, feel like, you know, who am I to speak on this topic?

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And I began to just to wrestle and wrestle and wrestle with God. God, I don't want to do this.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Please, you know, I'll talk in the dating series, I'll talk in the therapy series, I'll talk about anything else,

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 but politics, I just, I don't feel like I'm enough. And here's what God did in my time.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 As David looked at me and was like, "And that's exactly why you're doing it." And I was like, "What?"

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 God in my time, these past couple weeks, has just shown me time and time again through His Word,

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 where there seems to be this theme throughout Scripture, where God demonstrates that He uses inadequate,

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 disqualified people to show His heart. That there are stories throughout the entire Bible where God used people

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 who were not enough to demonstrate His enoughness and His sufficiency.

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And I had to sit there and wrestle with this tension. And I just want to start off by saying,

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 this is me, just right off the bat, saying that I may not say all the right things.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I may miss some felt needs in the room. So much so that I'm going to just spend some time reading my notes,

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 because I want to make sure that I articulate clearly, not what JD thinks, but God's heart for all people.

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And so, with that being said, I would like for you guys, just for the next few minutes, to lean in with me

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 as I read what I have spent hours and hours on, researching, studying, and praying for what I think God has

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 for our generation tonight. I don't want to run. I don't want to distance myself from the very thing I claim

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I want to be about, which is racial reconciliation. I want to run to it. Not on my own power, not on my own strength,

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 not on my own giftedness, not my own lack thereof, but on the authority of God and His word.

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 That's the only thing I stand on tonight. And I hope you'll join me in the conversation. So, here we go.

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 When talking about the divided states of America, I believe racism is one of the most dividing factors in our country right now.

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 We've seen protests this year, shootings, social media fights, things like Black Lives Matter versus All Lives Matter,

40
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 looting, hurtful words and actions, and I could go on and on and on of what the issue of racism has brought to our nation

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 this year and years prior. We have had so many things that are dividing us. I've heard different arguments from so many

42
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 different perspectives, so many articles and posts, some helpful, some hurtful. Some white people don't know

43
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 what they're allowed to say or how they can help. They wonder if they should make every effort to be woke

44
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 or if they should just shut up and sit down and be quiet. Some black people are having to address deep wounds

45
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 and realities around them and decide how to stand for what they believe in in these times.

46
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Some people are having to fight to find the right words, definitions, names, meanings, labels,

47
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 and navigate through a lot of difficult and muddy waters. Some say white people are privileged and neglect systemic racism

48
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 and can't see due to their unconscious bias. And some people say black people are using the history of slavery

49
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 in one of the freest countries in the world. It seems like everyone is speaking and making so much noise,

50
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 but at the same time, everyone has never been more silent. How is that so?

51
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Division. I think this is the result of division. Division creates a lot of noise, a lot of activity

52
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 without much, if any, true accomplishment. And I want you to ask yourself, before we get started,

53
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I want you to ask yourself, what is the end goal? Think about that. In what world are all ethnicities and people happy?

54
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Is happiness even the goal? Is social justice for all the goal? Is the once oppressed to become the oppressor the goal?

55
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Or is to have all of this blow over after the election and go back to normal the goal?

56
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 What is the end goal? And are we as humans on this side of heaven even capable of achieving it?

57
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Is the goal genuinely to end racism in our world today? If so, how? Will voting for a certain person make a way?

58
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Will certain policies make a way? Will Democrats or Republicans make a way?

59
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Will the changing or adding of laws make ways? Will learning, listening, and lamenting make a way?

60
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Will our votes make a way? When we look around right now, so many people in the world think they know

61
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 what is best and the best solution to end racism. But if I'm being honest, I am starting to care less and less

62
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 about what most people think. I care less about what social media thinks. I don't really care what a theory

63
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 or a label says or tells me. I do care, though, that I stick to my duty, first and foremost, as a child of God

64
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 to care deeply about what God and God alone thinks. And then let that inform every thought and action I have moving forward.

65
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 As Christians, we have to stop letting culture influence God's word and define the rules for God's people

66
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 and start being God's people who follow and trust God's word and it alone and use it to influence culture.

67
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 That's what has to take place. And I believe it can start here with a group like The Porch.

68
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 After reading, listening, researching, watching, and praying, I have come to believe that the problem of racism

69
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 is in fact not a political problem, but a spiritual problem to its core, to its roots.

70
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Therefore, we cannot tackle the problem first through political means, sociological means, or even moral means.

71
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 But through spiritual means is where this discussion must begin. I truly believe it has to begin with a spiritual conversation.

72
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 This is a sin problem, not a skin problem. And as Christians, we have a solution to our sin problem.

73
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 In my preparation, I have been convicted and had to address the areas of my life where I have let approval of man

74
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 guide my actions and thoughts over God's desire for me as a steward of his word to my generation.

75
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I have at times chosen to inform myself first through social media movements, through the news, in podcasts,

76
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 in articles over God's word and his heart. At times, I have chosen to stay silent out of fear of man's thoughts of me,

77
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 or even the color of my skin and the lack of experience that I've had to keep me back,

78
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 and have allowed it to keep me back instead of letting my force be God's unchangeable truth

79
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 and the truth he says about me and every person here tonight.

80
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 At times, I have chosen to stand and shout before I've even taken time or even thought about kneeling and begging and praying.

81
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And I want all of us to know that tonight these things in and of themselves are not bad.

82
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 It's not wrong to stand for the things that you deem unjust. It's not wrong to research or learn.

83
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 You should make it your objective to seek to understand, grow, and learn how to better love every person

84
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 and the things that have made them who they are.

85
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 But we have to know that trying to fight a spiritual rooted issue with only a man-made solution

86
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 will never bring us the peace that we claim to desire. You just cannot do it.

87
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And I'd like to humbly ask that all of us resist the urge in these next few minutes together to use "what about-isms."

88
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 What do I mean by that? A lot of times, we don't know how to listen to what is being said to us

89
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 because our mind is filled with "what about this?" "What about that?" I know I do this.

90
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 What about me? Well, what about what I saw over there? And what about he said or she said or they said?

91
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 What about? What about? The reason why I want to stay away from that is not because I don't want to hear you,

92
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 but because "what about" require a conversation.

93
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 A conversation would mean that I would have to be able to speak and then get the gift, the luxury of listening to every one of you.

94
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 But I just don't have that right now. I'd love to talk to all of you.

95
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I would sit down with any of you and discuss the research and studying I've done to seek understanding,

96
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 researching critical race theory, intersectionality, police brutality, unconscious bias or hegemonic power,

97
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Marxism, white privilege, systemic racism, colorblind racism, and so much more.

98
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 The list can go on and on on the things that each of us could put in the hard work to research and study and learn about.

99
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 That warrants a conversation where I both get to speak and listen. But right now, my call from God is to speak.

100
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And I have to lay aside my pride and fear in this moment and respond to the call of my life to teach my generation humbly about God's word, not my opinion.

101
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And because of this spiritual problem and because I cannot converse it with every one of you,

102
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 I have decided not to speak my heart or my opinions and to give you some tweetable quotes that you can go write down later and post on your Instagram story.

103
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 But God's truth and his truth alone, that's what I'm here to preach tonight. It's the only thing that matters.

104
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 But before we do that, I want to first have each of us just sit for a moment introspectively and ask ourselves, and I'm going to do the same, these questions.

105
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 One, do I believe that the word of God is sufficient? Do I believe that the word of God, what I mean by sufficient is, is it full, filled to the brim, no need for more, complete, lacking nothing, without error, no need for addition.

106
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 It can be fully trusted. And do I believe it in such a way that I will let it impact my life? That matters in this conversation.

107
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Secondly, do I believe that the gospel of Jesus Christ, which I will explain more in a moment, but do I believe that the gospel of Jesus Christ,

108
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 his death, burial, and resurrection to be the perfect sacrifice and atonement for all people's sins, do I believe that it is sufficient, it is enough, it is complete

109
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 for every injustice, every police brutality moment, every sexually abused person, every absent father,

110
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 do I believe that the gospel of Jesus Christ is sufficient to cover it all and to pay for it all? That matters in this conversation.

111
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Can the gospel truly forgive everything? Can it truly take darkness and make it light?

112
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Can it truly take wrong and extend grace and forgiveness? And can it truly lead to repentance and freedom?

113
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And lastly, do we believe that those two things together, the word of God and the gospel of Jesus Christ, has the ultimate power to change the world?

114
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Do we believe that? Because if our generation, I truly believe this guys, listen to me, I believe, starting off right from the back,

115
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 that if our generation would turn back to the word of God to inform our thinking and action and live out of the love which has been extended to us

116
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 through the death and resurrection of Jesus, I think that we would change the world.

117
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 If the answer is yes to those three questions, then I think that this talk will hopefully empower you, encourage you, and bring you peace.

118
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 But if the answer is no, then I want to ask you to address the bigger problems before we start addressing racial reconciliation.

119
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 No matter what, I truly believe and trust that God is in these next few minutes together and is ready to teach us something through his word.

120
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 So with that, if you have your Bibles, please open up to Ephesians chapter 2. And as you turn there, I'm going to pray.

121
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Father, you know my upbringing. You know every hair on my head, every cell in my body, every thought I have, every intention of my heart.

122
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And although I live my life to steward it in such a way that it would be pure, I do my best. I fail time and time again.

123
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And tonight, there will be something that through me alone will not be enough, but you are.

124
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 God, you are enough. And your plan to redeem the racial issues in our culture is enough.

125
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And it is possible today, not on human power or authority or action, but because something you have already accomplished through the life of your son.

126
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 So I pray tonight that that would ring true for every heart here.

127
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 That if a person tonight does not have a relationship with you, I pray first and foremost that they would get that relationship right

128
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 before we even begin talking about getting other relationships with people around us right.

129
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And for those that do call themselves saints, sons and daughters of God in the room tonight,

130
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 I pray that we would see that you have created a way out of this problem that is racism and social injustice.

131
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 You created a way out of it through your son, and then you have allowed us as sons and daughters of God to act in response to it.

132
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Tonight, take my little and use it according to your authority and your power.

133
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And you and you alone do I pray and ask these things. Amen.

134
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 All right.

135
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Ephesians chapter 2.

136
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Hey guys, I just felt the need to like start there.

137
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Start there right from the bat and let you guys know that man, we are all figuring this out together.

138
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And I think we're all here tonight knowing the series and knowing the reality because we're all trying to figure this out together.

139
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 But the best place to turn is God's word and that's what I want to model for us tonight.

140
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 In Ephesians chapter 2, we see that in these verses, we're going to read about the reality of a group of people called the Gentiles.

141
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 That's you and I.

142
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Because at the time of the church of Ephesus, what we see is that anyone who was not a Jew was referred to as a Gentile.

143
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 No matter who you were, if you were not a Jew, you were a Gentile.

144
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And therefore, because of that, there were things that were just true of you.

145
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Not because anything that you had done, but simply because of what you were born into, which is a huge issue.

146
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 An issue that God and Paul here, the writer of Ephesians, wants to talk about.

147
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 But we also see through this story that although there was a lot of corruption and a lot of oppression and different things to different ethnicities,

148
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 we were given access in this story to complete unity and oneness.

149
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Not through actions or policies or protests or researching or opinions, but through one act that took place a little over 2,000 years ago called the gospel.

150
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And we talked about it a lot around here.

151
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 But before I go any further, I want to make sure that every person here has an opportunity to know and receive the gospel.

152
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And so guys, this is the best part of my conversation tonight, of this talk tonight.

153
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Is the truth and the message that God saw man, created man in his image, equal of value and dignity and worth.

154
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 But man chose themselves and man sinned from the very beginning.

155
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And because of that, God orchestrated a plan from the very beginning to save mankind.

156
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And thousands of years later, we see him do that through his one and only son, the Bible says, by the name of Jesus.

157
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And Jesus stepped down from heaven and was sent to earth to be fully God and fully man.

158
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And he did something that you and I and the rest of history, past, present and future, could never do.

159
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 He was tempted in every way to follow the desires of his flesh, yet he remained without sin.

160
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 He was sinless, which made him the perfect sacrifice to atone for yours and I's mistakes.

161
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Every sin that we create, he paid for on the cross.

162
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And because of that, because Jesus Christ took our sins and he died the death that you and I deserved.

163
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 But not only that, was buried and then raised again three days.

164
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 It was through that, that Jesus Christ defeated sin.

165
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Every type of sin. Abuse, addiction, pornography, trafficking, every bit of injustice that we see, racism.

166
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Every sin he paid for in that moment when he died on the cross.

167
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And it was complete in his resurrection.

168
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 He actually rose from the dead three days later and he was united with God.

169
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And now, if we believe in that story, that God sent his son to die for us, we have access to something,

170
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 a bigger reality than we could ever dream of.

171
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And it's that God dwells in us.

172
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Like Shane was saying earlier, the Holy Spirit now dwells in us.

173
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And we now, instead of receiving judgment, condemnation, penalties, we now receive grace and freedom and access to God.

174
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And so before we talk about what that reality can do for us, I would ask that tonight you ask yourself,

175
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 have I even received and believed that?

176
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Because if you have not received or believed the gospel of Jesus Christ, none of this will make sense.

177
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 If you have not decided to forsake yourself, to lay aside the passions and the desires and the need for control in your old life

178
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 and submit to God, none of this will make sense.

179
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And so my first thing I want to ask you is, do you have a relationship with Jesus Christ?

180
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 That is the first spiritual issue that we have to identify,

181
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 that there are people out there who are sinful and need Jesus.

182
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 And if that's you, I would ask that you would take the rest of this time to get with people tonight and start a relationship with Jesus.

183
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And so if you've done that, Paul, he kind of sets the stage for that up in the first part of chapter two.

184
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And then he goes into what that means for you.

185
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 If you have a relationship with Jesus, here's now what you have access to, and here's what that means for you.

186
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And it's through this passage where Paul reveals how those who trust in Jesus are called to live,

187
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 but not on their own will or merit or action, but through the blood of Jesus.

188
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And we believe this, this truth.

189
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Here's what we're going to see tonight for you note takers, that through the gospel, we are rescued.

190
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Because of the gospel, we are reconciled.

191
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And with the gospel, we are rebuilt.

192
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 With the gospel, we are rebuilt.

193
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 So let's start with the first one.

194
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Through the gospel, we are rescued.

195
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Ephesians 2, 11 through 14, here's what it says.

196
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Don't forget that you Gentiles used to be outsiders.

197
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 You were called uncircumcised heathens by the Jews.

198
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 We won't even get into that.

199
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Who were proud of their circumcision, again, weird,

200
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 even though it affected only their bodies and not their hearts.

201
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 In those days, you were living apart from Christ.

202
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 You were excluded from citizenship among the people of Israel,

203
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 and you did not know the covenant promises God had made to them.

204
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 You lived in this world without God and without hope.

205
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 But now, you have been united with Christ Jesus.

206
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Once you were far away from God,

207
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 but now you have been brought near to him through the blood of Christ.

208
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 For Christ himself has brought peace to us.

209
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 He united Jews and Gentiles into one people,

210
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 when in his own body on the cross,

211
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 he broke down the wall of hostility that once separated us.

212
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Guys, this is very good news.

213
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 This is the word of God that reigns true today.

214
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Do you know why Paul was using this illustration of walls of hostility?

215
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 At this time, there was this big, huge building

216
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 known as the temple of God that everyone knew about.

217
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 It was like, bam, right in the middle of the room.

218
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Everyone saw it. Everyone knew about it.

219
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 But here was the wrong way of thinking that these people,

220
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 the Jews, had at this time.

221
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 If you were a Jew, you were a good person,

222
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 and you were a worthy enough person, and anyone else, bad.

223
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Not good, not worthy.

224
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 We are the Jews. Hurrah for us.

225
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 You're the Gentiles, bad.

226
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Something that couldn't even help.

227
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 It made no sense.

228
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Jews, you can get in.

229
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 You have access to a relationship with God.

230
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 That's what the temple did.

231
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 It was a place where God would come and dwell with his people.

232
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Jews, you can come in and dwell.

233
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Anyone else, sorry about you.

234
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 No access.

235
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 It would be like this.

236
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 If right now we have overflow rooms in the loft,

237
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 in stage two, it would be like we lined everyone up

238
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 in the door, and the only people who could come in here,

239
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 because most people, their desire is to get into the room

240
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 and be as close as they can to what's going on at the stage

241
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 and to really be near to all that's happening

242
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 and participate and be fully engulfed in all the singing

243
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 and the music and everything.

244
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 It's amazing, the lights, the production.

245
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I want to be in this room.

246
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And what if every person lined up, and we didn't say,

247
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 hey, you can't come in because there's no space.

248
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 We said, hey, you can't come in because you're not a Burnett.

249
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Burnetts do it better, so I've heard.

250
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Like, Burnett's the way to go.

251
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 The darker the hair, the better, whatever.

252
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And you can't come in because you're not a Burnett.

253
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And so people with red hair, black hair, you're in the loft.

254
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And then blondes, stage two.

255
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Sorry about you.

256
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 That's what that would be like.

257
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And I bet so many people would be like, what?

258
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 That is crazy.

259
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I can't help the color of my hair.

260
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 I can't help what, I was born with this color hair.

261
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 You know what, what are you talking about?

262
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 We can't get in because I'm not a Burnett?

263
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 That is so wrong, and it is wrong.

264
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 That's what's going on here, though.

265
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 People literally were told by society at this time,

266
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 guys, in the Bible times, society was telling people wrongly

267
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 that they were outsiders.

268
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 They were called names, racial slurs, you could say,

269
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 like uncircumcised heathens by the privileged Jews.

270
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Weird flex, but okay.

271
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 They were living apart from Christ.

272
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 That's what they were told, living apart from Christ.

273
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And then lastly, they were told, hey, and you're excluded from

274
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 citizenship because of your ethnicity,

275
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 because of your bloodline.

276
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Well, what, why?

277
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I couldn't help this.

278
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Sorry, you can't get in.

279
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 You're unworthy.

280
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Do you know what that sounds like?

281
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 When I was just reading the scripture over and over and over,

282
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 do you know what that sounds like?

283
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Racism.

284
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 That sounds like oppression.

285
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 That sounds like a system and an authority who was acting

286
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 unjustly on something that people had no control over.

287
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 And it was wrong.

288
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And what's crazy is, is all the things I've listed so far aren't

289
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 even the worst things.

290
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 The worst reality that these people had to face that was true of

291
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 them was this.

292
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 In verse 12, it says, "And you were told that you lived in this

293
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 world without God and without hope."

294
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Imagine that.

295
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Truly think about that.

296
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 For the people of God in this room, can you imagine?

297
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Think about every unjust thing that's ever happened to you,

298
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 the abuse that's happened to you, the fatherlessness, the divorce,

299
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 the pain, the cancer, the death, all the things that have been a

300
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 product of sin that has happened to you.

301
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Imagine someone coming up to you and telling you, "Oh,

302
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 and by the way, you have no hope.

303
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And God doesn't care about you."

304
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 All for something that you had no control over.

305
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 You could try and try and try, but nope.

306
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Because you're not a Jew, this isn't true for you.

307
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 That's what was going on here.

308
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 That's what these people were being told.

309
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 These people were experiencing what might have been the most realist

310
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 form of oppression and racism.

311
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 And it was awful.

312
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And it was hard.

313
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And God saw it.

314
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And he demanded change.

315
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 He demanded that something be different.

316
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 He knew, and Paul knew right here, that this was not the heart of God.

317
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And so that's why he continues to write.

318
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 The story did not end there.

319
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 The story did not end at this reality that, hey, God is over here,

320
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 and you, you're way over here, so far off, so far gone.

321
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 You have no hope.

322
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Paul said, "That is not going to be the story."

323
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Because that's not what God is about.

324
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Here's the story.

325
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 "But now, but now you have been united with Christ Jesus.

326
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Once you were far away from God, but now you have been brought near to him

327
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 through the blood of Christ.

328
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 For Christ himself has brought peace to us.

329
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 He united Jews and Gentiles into one people, one in his own body on the cross."

330
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 That's what I was just telling you.

331
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 On the cross, he broke down all of the walls of hostility that once separated us.

332
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 What once divided us, we are now united with Christ Jesus.

333
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 What once made us far away, we now have been brought near

334
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 because of the blood of Christ Jesus.

335
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 We once were hopeless, and we were without hope.

336
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 But now, we have the blood of Christ Jesus, and it changes everything.

337
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Through the gospel, through the blood of Christ, we are rescued.

338
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And that is the reality of every person in this room.

339
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 At one point, your sin had you far away, and it had you in darkness,

340
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 and it told you that you were excluded.

341
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It told you that you were not enough.

342
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 It told you that you should be full of shame and full of guilt.

343
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And for all of these things, your sin brought you down and down and down.

344
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 It took you further, further, and further away.

345
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 And God said, "I don't like that. I want to change that.

346
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 So much so that I am willing to send my one and only son to fix that once and for all."

347
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 And those who once were far off, no matter what the reason was,

348
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 every single one of us, we can unite under the truth that we once were far not off,

349
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 have now the ability to be brought near, not on our own merit, not on our own boasting,

350
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 not on any action or anything that we can do, not any protest or any new system or any new law.

351
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 We are brought near by the blood of Christ and the blood of Christ alone.

352
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 There's hope in that.

353
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 You know why? Because that takes so much off of me.

354
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Because I'm going to get it wrong.

355
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 But through Jesus, we are rescued.

356
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Rescued from oppression. Rescued from attacks.

357
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Rescued from racists.

358
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 And most importantly, rescued from the penalty of sin.

359
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Nothing is more powerful than that.

360
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 There is no greater news than that, that through the gospel, we are rescued.

361
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 And some of you might be thinking, "Hear me. What about my pain, though?

362
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And what about the unjust things taking place?

363
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 And what about the systems and the corruption in the government?

364
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 What about all of these different things?"

365
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 And I want to stop and just say, "You're right.

366
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 You're allowed to wonder that. You're allowed to have that conversation.

367
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 And you're allowed to recognize that as wrong and unjust and painful.

368
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 And you're allowed to sit in that.

369
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 But you don't have to stay in that because you have hope

370
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 in the rescue and the blood of Jesus Christ.

371
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 And nothing can change that.

372
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 No system, no government, no law can take that away from you.

373
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 You have been rescued once and for all.

374
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And that's why we can't take away from what's going on here.

375
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 And what I mean by that is we can't make this the problem with mankind

376
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 or with politics and think that justice can't be served until someone pays.

377
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Because if we think that justice isn't served until someone today presently pays

378
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 or does something different, then we are diminishing the price

379
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 that Jesus paid years ago on the cross.

380
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Do you get that?

381
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 If you think there's something still to be accomplished or done

382
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 to meet the need of your soul and the hurt and the injustice in the world,

383
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 then you are missing out on all that the gospel and the blood of Jesus offers you.

384
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 There is hope in the gospel.

385
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 For Christ himself has brought peace to us.

386
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 And when we acknowledge the power and the death of Jesus,

387
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 we will see what it can do in our relationships with everyone around us.

388
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Which leads to point two, because of the gospel, we are reconciled.

389
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Because of the gospel, reconciliation for all is obtainable.

390
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 And what do I mean by reconciled, that we are reconciled?

391
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 I mean that we can be restored relationally to Christ first and foremost

392
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 and then to one another through the blood of Jesus.

393
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 I'm going to keep pounding that home.

394
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Not will be one day reconciled.

395
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Not could be if we just get this right and we just learn this and change this.

396
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Not could be reconciled.

397
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 We are reconciled by the blood of Christ.

398
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 There's this hymn I grew up on that I've just been singing all day long.

399
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 And this might not land if y'all don't back me up.

400
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 But I just want us to maybe sing this the rest of this week.

401
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Are you like, is this man about to sing?

402
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Kind of. We're going to sing.

403
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 This song, it says something and the response every time is nothing but the blood of Jesus.

404
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

405
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Y'all heard the song? Anyone?

406
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 It says, what can wash away my sin?

407
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

408
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 What can make us whole again?

409
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

410
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 And it says, oh precious, I ain't singing it, is the flow that makes us white as snow.

411
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 There's no other fount I know than what?

412
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 We'll work on it.

413
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 But guys, that's so true.

414
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 We overcomplicate this. That's what I realized. I overcomplicated this.

415
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 The word nothing, it's absolute.

416
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 We've made everything so wishy-washy, but scripture is absolute.

417
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 And I know that we sing songs like this, but do we believe it?

418
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 What can make me whole?

419
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

420
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 That's powerful.

421
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 If people believe that, something powerful coming.

422
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Ephesians 2, 15 through 18 says, you know, how did he receive, how do we receive reconciliation?

423
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 It says this, Jesus did this by ending, another absolute word, ending the system of law with its commands and regulations.

424
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself one new people from the two groups.

425
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of his death on the cross.

426
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 And our hostility towards each other was put to death.

427
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Done. Gone. Finished.

428
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 And he brought this good news of peace to you Gentiles who were far away from him and peace to the Jews who were near.

429
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Now all of us can come to the father through the same Holy Spirit because of what Christ has done for us.

430
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 What does this tell me? That the gospel has the power to restore every bit of relational hurt in this room tonight.

431
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 The gospel has the power to reconcile every bit of injustice that we see in our world.

432
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 Every bit of oppression we see in our world, the gospel and the blood of Jesus can provide a solution to every bit of it.

433
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 The scripture just says, like, let's just walk through it.

434
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 Let's just like look at what it means to just let God's word lead us and guide us.

435
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 It says, ended the blood of Jesus. It ended the system of laws within the commandments and regulations.

436
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 What does that mean? It means that there is no man-made law that is stronger than what God has already done through his son.

437
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 None. The next one.

438
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 The blood of Jesus made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself one new people from the two groups.

439
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 What does that mean? It means that at one time there was oppression and there was a separation.

440
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 And we've seen that time and time again where people have tried to do this.

441
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 But through Jesus, what was now divided and what is divided and what might one day again be divided,

442
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 the things that are divided right now are now one through Jesus.

443
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 There's unification. Welcome to the family. All are equal.

444
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 No matter your skin color, your background, your beliefs, we are all see each other as one in Christ.

445
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 And it also says, and the blood of Jesus made a way for hostility towards one another,

446
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 racism towards one another, oppression towards one another to be put to death.

447
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 What does that mean? It means that I don't run from the hurt.

448
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 I don't run from the opportunity to preach God's word on an important matter.

449
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 We don't run from hard conversations and conflict and hurt and pain.

450
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 We don't run from it. We press into it because there is an opportunity for reconciliation because hostility is dead in Jesus name.

451
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 It's lost its grip. It's lost its power.

452
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 And now we can humbly come before one another and the things that once divided us.

453
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Now we can find unification in the blood of Jesus and it alone.

454
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 What does this sound like to you?

455
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 If the first part of the scripture sounded like racism, this sounds a whole lot like racial reconciliation.

456
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 What was once excluded has been included.

457
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 What was once divided has been united and seen equal.

458
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 This tells me that if reconciliation to God was made possible through Jesus and that we believe that,

459
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 that means that reconciliation, hear me, reconciliation is not something to be created by our generation.

460
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 It's not something to be developed or pressed on towards or to achieve or work to.

461
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 It's something to be accessed, obtained and acknowledged through Jesus.

462
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 It already exists.

463
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 We don't have to keep striving. We don't have to keep trying.

464
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Wrong thinking says that action leads to reconciliation.

465
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 But my Bible says that the idea, the belief in reconciliation will produce action.

466
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 Here's what I mean by that.

467
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 You can be angry and you can think that protesting or rioting or posting or doing all these things in the name of action could lead to reconciliation.

468
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 But what I read here and what I have studied here is that reconciliation does not need action from us.

469
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 What needs to happen is us to see that reconciliation has already been accessible by Jesus.

470
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 And if we would believe that we have an opportunity both reconciled to God and to man, that will then produce the right kind of action.

471
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 And as I wrap up this passage, it says, "The gospel also brought good news of peace to you Gentiles who were far away from him."

472
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 We get that.

473
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 But here's what most people don't want to talk about.

474
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 The gospel also brought peace to you who were far away and to the Jews who were near.

475
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 The gospel was also needed for the Jews who were near.

476
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 What does that tell me?

477
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 It tells me that at this time, the privileged, the know-it-alls, the wealthy and the religious people of that day still needed the gospel.

478
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 They needed the gospel to be their way towards unification.

479
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 They didn't need what they were born into.

480
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 They didn't need the ability to have close proximity to the dwelling place of God.

481
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 They didn't need to lean on the privilege that they had or their traditions or law or their works.

482
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 Nothing got them a relationship with Jesus.

483
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 They had nothing to boast in.

484
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 They needed Jesus just as much as the people who were far away.

485
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 Everyone needs Jesus.

486
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 Everyone has access to Jesus.

487
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 Everyone. Do you believe it?

488
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 And when both Jew and Gentile or white, black, Hispanic, Asian, every ethnicity represented in this room and out there.

489
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 When all of us choose to obtain access to the reconciliation to God and man offered through the blood of Christ.

490
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 We can see our last points take place that with the gospel, we are not only rescued.

491
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 We're not only reconciled to God and to one another, but we are rebuilt.

492
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Ephesians 2 19-22 says, "So now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners,

493
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 but you are citizens along with all of God's holy people.

494
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 You are members of God's family.

495
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Together we are his house built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets.

496
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 And the cornerstone is who?

497
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 Is Christ Jesus himself.

498
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 And we are carefully joined together in him, becoming a holy temple for the Lord.

499
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 Through him, you Gentiles are also being made part of this dwelling where God lives by his spirit."

500
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 This again is like temple language.

501
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 The purpose of the temple before Christ.

502
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 This is important.

503
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 This is like some Bible stuff one-on-one that I just learned like last year.

504
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 The purpose -- I know, you're like, what is this guy doing up there?

505
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 That's my point.

506
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 So the temple of God before Jesus was where God would come and dwell.

507
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 Like his presence would come into the temple and dwell with the Jews.

508
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 He didn't like the separation and the exclusion that that meant of other ethnicities and people.

509
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 He wanted all to have access to him.

510
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 So then what did he do?

511
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 He sent his son.

512
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 Colossians 1 19 says that the fullness of God was pleased to dwell in his son.

513
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 So now God did not need to dwell in a temple.

514
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 It dwelt in the full God-man, fully God and fully man.

515
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 He dwelled in him and he walked the earth with people just like you and I.

516
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 And then just like the temple was torn down, Jesus was torn down through his death and his resurrection.

517
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 And then he ascended to heaven.

518
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 And when he went up to heaven after he rose from the dead, do you know where God's spirit then dwelled?

519
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 Where?

520
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 In us.

521
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 Once in the temple, separation.

522
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 Didn't like that.

523
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 Down.

524
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 The plan, he dwelled in Jesus.

525
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 He came down.

526
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 He paid the price so that then God could dwell in us.

527
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 Every single one of us to be members of the household of God.

528
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 The cornerstone of which the whole new structure is being built.

529
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 Jesus Christ himself.

530
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 Guys, it's just straight in the scripture.

531
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 So now, when the lost and the far off and the hurt and the oppressed and the raped and the abused and the lied to and stolen from and bitter and prideful and addicted people, the oppressed people,

532
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 the people have dealt with all the different types of injustice.

533
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 When they come looking for a place to find restoration and unity and reconciliation and a family and love and forgiveness and grace and redemption,

534
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 they are not met with walls and things prohibiting them to experience with God.

535
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 No, they are met with the presence of God in the hearts of his sons and daughters, us.

536
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 That's now what people get to go to to experience God, his people, you and I.

537
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 We are now the place where people come.

538
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 The church is now the place where people come and get to see God's glory on full display.

539
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 What was once only attainable for a certain people group now through Jesus, access to all.

540
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 And that's represented through the body of Christ, the family of God.

541
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 It says, "Carefully he builds us together in him, becoming the holy temple for the Lord to dwell, Jesus Christ being the cornerstone."

542
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 What does that mean?

543
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 That we are the family of God.

544
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 Walls once separated us, now we are like bricks extending from Jesus, building a new structure for God to dwell in the hearts of every single one of us,

545
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 no matter our backgrounds and our stories and our opinions.

546
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 It's all just through Jesus.

547
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 And now because of Jesus abolishing these walls and killing the division and the things that literally kept us from God,

548
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 we are now able to be reconciled to other men.

549
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 And I just want to close with this.

550
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 I know, like, guys, trust me, I'm going to go tonight and be like, "You were so serious up there. Why were you so serious?"

551
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 And I'm going to go sit and I'm going to go think about just the reality of this.

552
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 But here's what I know to be true.

553
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 Like, I truly believe that if our generation would start taking this serious, things would change.

554
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 I've said that time and time again, but I believe in you guys.

555
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 I believe that racial reconciliation is possible because I believe in each of you.

556
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 And better than believing in you, I believe in the Spirit in you.

557
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 You're going to fail. You're going to not listen appropriately.

558
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 You're going to say something hurtful.

559
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 You're going to go through something again that is unjust or abusive or wrong.

560
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 You're going to experience something really hard because that's the reality of the world.

561
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 That's what the Bible promises us.

562
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 It assures us that in this world, you will have suffering.

563
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 But it doesn't end there. It says, "But take heart because I have overcome the world."

564
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 That's what Jesus says.

565
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 You can clap.

566
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 But listen, it's not just me who believes in you, although I do.

567
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 I pray for you often.

568
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 I prayed for you guys so much, this message tonight,

569
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 that you would see Jesus as the solution to every bit of the unjust things taking place right now.

570
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 And also as God, as the hope in what's going to happen next week and the outcome of it.

571
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 But I'm not the only one. Jesus.

572
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 Jesus believed in you.

573
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 This is one of my favorite passages in the Bible.

574
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 It just blew my mind the first time I read it.

575
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 Jesus is about to go literally suffer on the cross with you and I in mind.

576
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 And before that, the writer John takes us in this moment, this intimate moment,

577
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 where Jesus is on his knees and he is dropping sweats of blood

578
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 over the reality of what's about to take place.

579
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 It's about to be that gruesome.

580
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 And instead of thinking about his own pain and his own suffering,

581
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 he was thinking about the future suffering that you and I were going to have to endure.

582
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 How do I know that? Because here's what he prays.

583
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 He's literally praying to God. And here's what he chooses to pray about.

584
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 You and I. Read it yourself. It says in verse 20 of chapter 17,

585
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 "I am praying not only for these disciples," his 12 disciples,

586
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 "but also for all who will ever believe in me through their message."

587
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 That is you and I.

588
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 If you believe in Jesus Christ, he is praying right now.

589
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 Jesus was out loud before he died, praying about you and I.

590
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 And he says this, "I pray that they will all be one just as you and I are one.

591
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 As you are in me, Father, and I am in you,

592
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 and may they be in us so that the world will believe that you sent me."

593
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 Guys, what does that mean?

594
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 It's Jesus right there is saying that the answer to the world,

595
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 finding hope in Jesus Christ is through them being one.

596
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 That tells me that God is most glorified

597
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 and will remain most glorified to our world

598
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 when we, the church, are most unified.

599
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 When we experience unification, God will receive glorification.

600
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 And that is the mission of the believer.

601
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 Did you know that when you signed up for this,

602
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 when you chose to say no to religion and just doing some works

603
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 and doing some things to get the best life now,

604
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 you didn't just sign up for that.

605
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 You signed up for a purpose bigger than yourself,

606
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 to show the glory of God to a lost and hurting and dividing and seeking world.

607
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 And Jesus knew the answer, unity.

608
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 He knew that in 2020, there would be more division than ever.

609
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 And people are going to look around and see division

610
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 on so many different topics and be like, "Yeah, that makes sense.

611
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 Oh, more people angry, that makes sense.

612
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 Oh, division, that makes sense."

613
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 But then there's going to be this, in all the darkness,

614
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 there's going to be this light.

615
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 This is the church, and people are going to be like,

616
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 "Wait, what's going on over there?

617
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 Why are these people so happy?

618
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 Why are they so good together?

619
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 Where's the gossip? Where's the division?

620
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 Where's the separation? Why are they so united?"

621
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 And it's because we are a people who believe the Word of God to be true.

622
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 That it's not through our own works.

623
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 It's not through our own action.

624
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 But it's through the blood of Christ.

625
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 And it's nothing but the blood of Christ that gives us the opportunity of hope.

626
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 And so as an action point, this is all I have for you tonight.

627
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 I don't have much.

628
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 I say as an action point, believe it.

629
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 Believe this to be true.

630
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 Hit your knees tonight.

631
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 Pray for it to be true and let it transform the way that you live.

632
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 Follow the example of Christ.

633
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 Do you know how Christ obtained reconciliation?

634
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 By laying his life down.

635
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
 May we do the same.

636
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 Pray for ways to lay your life down for your brothers and sisters around you.

637
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 Think about the division and the phone calls you need to make tonight

638
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 to the people that you have hostility towards

639
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
 and break down those walls in Jesus' name and ask for forgiveness.

640
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 Get it right.

641
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 There's nothing worth holding on to separation and bitterness.

642
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 The Bible actually calls it like, like unforgiveness is like decaying bones in our body.

643
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 And you are surely and slowly losing it.

644
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 And you know it and I know it.

645
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,000
 And you're making the problem, all of this and all of that and all these posts.

646
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 But there's a solution.

647
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
 And it's the blood of Jesus.

648
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 So may we be the generation that obtains that solution

649
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 and lets it lead to God-fearing and God-honoring action.

650
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
 Because when God's people are most unified,

651
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 that is when Christ will be most glorified.

652
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 Let it be so.

653
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
 Father,

654
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:56,000
 like Jesus, I just want to come and ask

655
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
 that the world would know

656
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 that you sent your son not because of a post on social media,

657
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
 not because of a protest

658
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 or anything that we can do on our own strength,

659
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 but that the world would know

660
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
 that you sent your son because we

661
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 will stand up as brothers and sisters in Christ,

662
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 united not by the color of our sin,

663
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 but the blood of your son.

664
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 And we will say that division stops here.

665
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
 Racism stops here.

666
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 Oppression stops here.

667
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 And unity starts here.

668
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 Reconciliation starts here.

669
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 The people of God,

670
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 I pray that you would use men and women of this room,

671
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
 of every background, every ethnicity,

672
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
 to go and share the love of Jesus.

673
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
 And for those tonight

674
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
 who it's really hard to believe

675
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
 that such an opportunity is possible

676
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
 because of the hurt and pain they've experienced,

677
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
 I pray that tonight, God,

678
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
 you would just show yourself real to them.

679
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 They would understand what it looks like

680
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
 to have a relationship with you,

681
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
 and that would influence their relationship

682
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 with others moving forward.

683
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
 Thank you for the blood of Jesus

684
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
 that covers every sin.

685
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 We worship you because of it,

686
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
 and that I pray, amen.

687
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:43,000
