1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 What's going on, Porch?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 How we doing, Fort Worth? We got people listening all over the world.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 We're so glad that you're tuning in. Let me say this up front.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 These churches just around the country are gathering in rooms and putting on the porch.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And I'm so proud of you that you have caught a vision of what God wants to do through young adults,

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 20s and 30-somethings, to change the world, to reclaim the world for the sake of Christ.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I want you to know that I prayed for you today, I thought about you, and I'm crazy encouraged that you would gather in this way

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 and just kind of join this movement that God is doing in spite of us.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And so we are back in 1 Peter 2, focusing on two primary verses this evening.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I'll read them to you.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 "Dear friends," verse 11, "Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong,

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day He visits us."

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Let me pray.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 God, we love you, we thank you so much for your servant Peter, who walked with Jesus,

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 who saw Jesus firsthand as an example, and who scribed these letters to the scattered church

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 that you have preserved for thousands of years so that we might open tonight

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 and that your Holy Spirit would minister to us through the reading and the preaching of your Word.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Father, protect these friends from my opinion.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And Father, awaken our hearts to your desires so that we may live them.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Anybody here like to travel?

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Okay.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I love to travel.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Monica and I love to travel, love to go new places.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Didn't travel much growing up.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Growing up, vacation was like San Antonio.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 We wanted to go real big.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 We'd go to the Guadalupe, like tube the river or something.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 That was doing it right.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And so just didn't really see the world much growing up.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And then when I became a Christian as an adult in my 20s, it was interesting

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 because instantly I started going on these discipleship trips.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 One of the first trips I went on was to Rwanda in Africa,

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 and we were training the government on conflict resolution.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And so when you go on a trip like that, you're thinking about what it's going to be like.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 You have no idea.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 You just don't know what it's going to be like when you get there.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And so I had all of this anticipation, this long plane ride,

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 and as soon as I get off the plane and leave the airport, I'm walking down the street,

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 and these kids kind of gather around me.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 They're like, "Mzungu, Mzungu, Mzungu."

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 They're like, "Tall white man."

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I guess that's what that means.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And so you instantly realize you're not home.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 They're like, "Foreigner, foreigner."

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And so then the next day I wake up to teach, and it's hot.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 It's like 108 degrees, and so I'm in shorts.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And they're like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 You can't wear shorts. Why? It's hot."

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I'm like, "Oh, no. Here, only boys under 10 years of age wear shorts.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Like if you're over 10, you wear pants."

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And I'm like, "I'm trying to get my head around this,

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 but there's things that you want to know if you're a foreigner, right?

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 You want to understand their culture."

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And so they're essentially saying, "No, you're about to teach in like a Spongebob Squarepants shirt or something."

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And if you wore one, I'm sorry. You shouldn't.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And so they're like, "They're helping me. You can't do that."

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And so there are all these things I began to learn.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Like we went to have a meal, and you know, in America, it's like women first, ladies go first.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 There, it's elderly first.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And so whoever's the oldest, they would go first.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And if you went to kind of grab food, you would never use your left hand

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 because your left hand was your sanitizing hand.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Your left hand was the one you'd use to clean yourself after you went to the restroom.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I didn't know either, right?

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And so if you're there in the lunch line, and you reach for the spoon with your left hand,

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 everybody's like, "Oh, man, we're done."

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And I'm like, "Well, somebody should have told me.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 I didn't know that's what that hand was for."

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And what's interesting is when you would walk with someone, like a man, a brother in Christ,

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 they'd grab your hand, and they'd walk with you hand in hand.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 They would interweave the fingers.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 It's not awkward. It's not awkward.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Like that's what I kept telling myself.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And so much so that when I was teaching through the translator, through the interpreter,

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 that's the first thing that he did was he reached for my hand,

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 and the whole time I'm preaching, we're walking around hand in hand, he and I,

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 fingers interlocked like we're on a date.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 And when you would greet someone, when you would greet someone,

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 you would bump foreheads and then kiss each cheek.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 I didn't know, you know?

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And I'm a tall guy, and so the dude goes in for this like Muay Thai clinch and like pulls me down,

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 and it's like this awkward kind of first kiss.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I'm like, "What are we doing here?"

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And I just wish I knew, you know?

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I wish someone would have told me about this.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And so this is true for when you go to different places.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 In Israel, I was on the Temple Mount with Monica,

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 and I had my hand on her back like this,

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 and we were stopped by the authorities.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 You can't even be in close proximity with someone of the opposite sex.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 It is illegal to touch a woman in this area.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I mean like hold hands or anything.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 We're about to get arrested because I'm walking with my wife with my hand on her back.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Who knew? Like I wish I would have known this stuff.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 In Jordan, if you compliment someone on anything, like you say,

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 "Man, I really like that picture," they'll give it to you

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 just because the culture is so hospitable.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 If you say, "Man, what a beautiful place you have,"

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 they're like, "Here's the keys. You want my house? What?"

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And like somebody needs to tell me these things.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 In the Amazon, if they cook something for you and they offer it to you,

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 it is incredibly offensive not to eat it right there.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Whatever it is, and you might not know, like one guy got boiled ants.

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And yeah, we didn't know what it was,

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 but it's like you eat it or you have offended an entire people group.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 In Haiti, if you shake one person's hand, you have to shake everyone's hand.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And so like we're in this church of like a thousand people,

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 and I'm like, "Oh, hey, how you doing?"

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And then people are lining up. I'm like, "Oh, take that back."

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 You know, what's up?

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And so it's just good to know these things if you're a foreigner.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 If you go somewhere, it is important to know the do's and the don'ts of that place.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 And so in these two verses of 1 Peter 2,

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Peter is going to remind us that we are like foreigners.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And he's going to give us the do's and don'ts of surviving this world as a follower of Christ.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And the problem with this text is if you've come to faith as a 20-something or a 30-something,

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 then what has happened is you've kind of started to understand the world.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Like some of you, you're like, "Dude, I got the world.

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Like I'm great at the world. I know how to dress. I know the language to talk.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I know how to make money. I can do good in business. I'm pretty. I'm cute. I'm handsome."

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Right? "I understand the world."

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 And then you come in and you collide with Jesus, and it's like you're learning to walk all over again.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And you're like, "Man, these Christians are goofy. Like how do I--I don't even know.

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Like how do I reprioritize everything? And can you even have fun as a Christian?"

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And you're learning a new world.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And that's the world that Peter's going to talk to us about today.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And I think a barrier to this message is that for so many of us,

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 we think that Christianity is an idea that you add to your life.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And friends, it's not.

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 It's the thrust of your life.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 It's the trajectory of your life.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 It's the road of your life and the vehicle traveling on that road.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And it's what makes that vehicle go.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Christianity is everything. It is all-encompassing.

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 It's who you are if you have a relationship with Jesus.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 It is not an accessory.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 You cannot view it as an accessory.

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 It changes everything about you.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 As David said last week, it changes your purpose.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And we're going to look at how to survive in this world.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Like if you're here and you think about--when you dream about the future,

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 you simply dream about maximizing your life in this world.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 You simply dream about the next 40 or 60 years.

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 You don't get it.

148
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 That you're an eternal being.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 You're going to live somewhere forever.

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Your soul is going to exist somewhere for eternity.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Forever and ever and ever.

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 600 years from now, still going.

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 600 billion years from now, still going.

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 You're still somewhere.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 That's the future. That's your future.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 We have to get that we belong to that world, which is here.

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 So more on that. We are like a foreigner.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 So we're talking about how to live like a foreigner.

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 We're in 1 Peter. Peter was a friend of Jesus.

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 As I said, he knew him. He walked with him.

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 He denied him. And then he was restored to him in John chapter 21.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 He was a fisherman turned fisher of men.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 He wrote this book to the Jews and the Greeks

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 that have trusted in Christ who were scattered around Asia Minor,

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 which is modern day Turkey, about 30 years after Jesus died.

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And so we're going to, as we move through these two verses,

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 we're going to talk about how you're not home,

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 what you don't do, and what you must do as a foreigner.

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 He says in verse 11,

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 "Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 to abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul."

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 We're going to hit on this idea of strangers and exiles.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 He's saying this, "Don't settle for this world."

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 That's my first point. You cannot settle for this world.

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Don't settle in.

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 "Live as" verse 11 says, "foreigners and exiles."

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And so the people that you are surrounded by in this world,

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 they are not your people.

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 They don't belong to the kingdom that you belong to.

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 You don't want to get swept up in that culture.

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 You're different. You're to stand apart from them.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 The apostle Paul tells us,

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 "Like stars against a dark night that stand in contrast."

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 That you're to shine as you live in this place that you don't belong to.

185
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And the place that you live in,

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 now we're going to go theology, deep water a little bit.

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 The place that you live in is not what it will be.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Christ is going to come back here and it's going to be a new earth

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 that we're going to live in forever and ever and ever and ever.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Heaven is here.

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Heaven's not this place that you float up to in the clouds with angels and harps.

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Heaven's going to be here.

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 And what this does, see, as I said, I like to travel.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And there's this angst in me that I want to see the world.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I want to go to places.

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Whenever I travel, I want to go somewhere that I've never been.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And I want to experience it.

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And I want new experiences.

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And if I don't, and you go somewhere that I haven't been,

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 I feel like I'm missing out.

201
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 I'm looking on your Instagram feed and I'm like #fomo everywhere.

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I want to go and see it all.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 But the fact that I'm going to be here forever means that I don't have to cram everything into the next 60 years.

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 That if I want to go to Thailand, I don't have to go to Thailand in the next 60 years.

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I can go to Thailand in 600 years.

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And I can see Thailand in its redeemed state, in its perfect state, without sin, disease, and death.

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 I can go to Thailand. I'll go one day. You can go with me.

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And we'll see it without sex trafficking, without the corruption that sin has ushered in there.

209
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And if you think the beaches there are beautiful now, you should see them.

210
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 We will see them in their redeemed state.

211
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And I don't need to experience that now.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 I've got the rest of the rest of the rest to experience that.

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Because that's the world I belong to.

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 It's a new world here.

215
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Right now I live in this broken world like you as a foreigner and in exile.

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And so until then, friend, hang on.

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Stay the course.

218
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 If this life feels really hard, it's beating you down, relax.

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 It's not the world you belong to.

220
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 It's not the one you will exist in forever.

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Give yourself fully to the work of the Lord and create time and space to renew your mind around that reality.

222
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Every day, it's important, every day there's two kinds of people here.

223
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 There's those of you that have been with Jesus today.

224
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 There's those of you who say you know him but you spent zero time with him today.

225
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And you don't know him.

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 If you didn't spend time with him, you don't know him.

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 If you have not prioritized him today, you don't know him as you should.

228
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I pray that you get to know him.

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 When I go to Africa, I'm a visitor on a mission.

230
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 My days there are purposeful.

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 I don't just kind of make that place like I'm staying at home.

232
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I don't expect it to be comfortable.

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 I don't get to that bed and see that mattress and think oh man, you know the first thing I'm going to do is go to Amazon Prime and order a Tempur-Pedic because I'm going to stay here.

234
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I'm going to make my home here.

235
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 No, I don't do that. I'm there on mission.

236
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I sleep at night. I wake up the next day.

237
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I'm like hey, we're going to go to this village and share with these people and do this and love them and go on mission.

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 I'm focused. That's this life.

239
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 That's today.

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 That's tomorrow. That's your agenda.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 See, when you try to make this place your home, you're settling for second best.

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 See, if you know Christ, this is as bad as you're ever going to experience.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 But if you do not have a relationship with Jesus, this is as good as it gets.

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 It's all you got. You will never experience anything better than this broken world.

245
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 But if you know Jesus, man, the good times here, they're just simply commercials of perfection to come.

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Paradise to come.

247
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And so we stand out in this world as foreigners by the way we do everything, by the way we date.

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 They call us crazy. Why would you date that way? With purity? That's crazy.

249
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 You got to try out before you buy. You got to make sure everything fits. That's crazy.

250
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 No, it's godly.

251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 We stand out by the way we don't objectify women or objectify the opposite sex.

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 We don't use people. We stand out by the way we act at the company happy hour or whether we go or not.

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 We stand out by the way we spend money. It communicates the world that we belong to.

254
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 The way we spend money, the things we buy and invest in and give to what we do on the weekend communicates the world that we live in or how we pursue comforts like we're going to be here forever or we're just passing through on mission.

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 When I go on mission, I expect to be uncomfortable. Comes down to my expectations.

256
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And Peter is saying that we're at war.

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 That we're like soldiers who have been deployed.

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Because anybody seen Hacksaw Ridge?

259
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 The movie's like divided into two settings.

260
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 One is at home and one is at war.

261
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And it's very different. The scenes are very different.

262
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 When he's at home, it's dating and sweet and laughter and birds chirping.

263
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And then he goes to war. He's deployed.

264
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And he's not walking over dead bodies, picking up the limbs of his friends, dodging enemy fire, you know, trying to escape that which is seeking to hunt him and kill him and has killed his friends.

265
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 He's not walking around on the battlefield, seeing the explosions and smelling the stench of death, wondering, am I home?

266
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Am I, should I set up shop here, build a house here, get comfortable here?

267
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Am I at home? No, man, you're at war.

268
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And there's an enemy after you seeking to kill you.

269
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 He wants to destroy your marriage long before you ever even met the prospect.

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 He wants your children to hate you decades before you have them.

271
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 He wants you to be discontent in your job, to use people and love money.

272
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And he's got a battle plan.

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 You got to be smart. You got to fight smart.

274
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Second Timothy two verse four says no one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer.

275
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And so he's he's hit on this idea that we're foreigners in exile.

276
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And now he's going to tell us what we don't do. And then he's going to tell us what we are to do.

277
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 That's how he's divided up these these two verses. And so the thing that we don't do is we don't give in to sinful desires.

278
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 This is my new response to the question, how far is too far? I get asked that a lot.

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 How far is too far? Don't give in or abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul.

280
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 It was first Corinthians 618, which has flea sexual immorality.

281
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Now I'm just going to say abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul.

282
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Abstinence is like the least cool word in the world, right? Like abstinence.

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Unless it's paired with sinful desires which wage war against your soul.

284
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Hurrah. He's saying you have desires within you that you're to fight with all your might, with everything you can.

285
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 You're to draw enemy lines and not cross. You're to put up barricades.

286
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 These things are within you that seek to carry you away.

287
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And you're to fight, abstain from them, suppress them with all of your might.

288
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And this flies in the face of, well I wouldn't have this desire if God didn't want me to.

289
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 I wouldn't have this desire if God didn't want me to.

290
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 That's crazy talk. That's satanic talk.

291
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I love the rationale of children. I have three of them.

292
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 My girls, you know, they're in this anti-drug program at school.

293
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And they're just like, "Daddy, why would anybody smoke cigarettes?"

294
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And like their rationale is so logical. They're like, "Okay, let me just get this straight.

295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 If I do that, I'm going to get addicted to it. I'm going to have to pay for it.

296
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 It might kill me and it can hurt those I love. Daddy, why would anybody do that?"

297
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And I'm like, "Man, that's a great question. I don't know."

298
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 "Your mom smoked. I never did." "No, I'm just kidding. I did."

299
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And they're like, "Oh, this is a good one." They're like, "Daddy,

300
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 if you don't get married until you're like in your 20s, then why would anybody ever spend time with boys?"

301
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Thank you, Jesus. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus.

302
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I'm like, that's the most brilliant thing I've ever heard anybody say.

303
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 You are so smart.

304
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So why do we get drunk? Why do we get high? Why do we sleep together?

305
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Sinful desires which wage war against our soul.

306
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 You have desires inside of you that seek to kill you.

307
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 This weekend I went on a double date with my wife and two close friends of ours.

308
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 We went fishing, which I never really loved to fish, but we had a blast.

309
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 We had three rods and reels on the boat, and there was one that kept catching.

310
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 We kept catching fish, and there was no confusion as to why.

311
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 You looked at the lure, and it just looked real.

312
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 It looked like a real, tiny, alive fish, though it wasn't.

313
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I just thought about what we were doing. We were lying to those fish.

314
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 They have this desire inside of them to eat.

315
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 They chomp down on that lure. Those three-pronged hooks with sharp ends

316
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 grabs the inside of their cheek, if that's even a thing, and we pull them into our world.

317
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Then that's what's happening to you.

318
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 That's what's happening to you.

319
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 There is an enemy who appeals to the sinful desires which wage war against your soul,

320
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 and he teaches you to justify it. It's natural. God created that.

321
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 God wants me to have nice things.

322
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 He feeds you these lies, and you bite down, and you are pulled into his world,

323
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 deeper into his world.

324
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 So there's a hook there.

325
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 We're to kill sin, or sin will kill you.

326
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Kill sin, or sin will kill you. You've got to have a battle plan.

327
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 What's your battle plan? Art of war, man.

328
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 What are you doing? How are you doing? What's your plan?

329
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 When I was in high school, we went to a rival high school.

330
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 I was sitting in the bleachers.

331
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I was with two buddies, just the three of us, which was stupid.

332
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 We're sitting there in the bleachers, just the three of us, at a rival high school,

333
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and there's this guy there that doesn't like me that goes to that high school.

334
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 At halftime, it's a basketball game, at halftime, he goes to the middle of the court,

335
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 and he throws up his hands, and he points at me, and he throws up his hands.

336
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 He's like, "We're going to do this." I'd never been in a fight, but I was about to be in one.

337
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I was fine with that. This is about to happen.

338
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 We're going to go out back, just like you see in the movies, on the asphalt,

339
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 under a street lamp at night. I'm serious.

340
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 There's hundreds of people there from their school, which was a terrible idea for me.

341
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 My buddy's like, "What's your plan?" I'm like, "What do you mean, what's my plan? I'm going to fight."

342
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 He's like, "No, man, are you going to go uppercut, or are you going to take it to the ground,

343
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Brazilian jiu-jitsu? What's your plan?"

344
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I'm like, "Man, I don't know. Hurt him? Win? I don't know."

345
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 He's like, "Dude, you've got to have a plan."

346
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 I'm like, "Okay." Then this guy's spinning around in my head.

347
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 We go out back, and this thing goes down, and I'm on my back, and he's on top of me,

348
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 just punching me as hard as he can.

349
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 All I could think about is, "Dude, he had a better plan."

350
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Then it's over. I'm in and out of consciousness, with a really sad sight, bleeding.

351
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 My buddy, truth teller, is like, "You didn't have a good plan, bro."

352
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 I'm like, "Thanks a lot."

353
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 "What's your plan?

354
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 What's your plan in the fight, in the battle, with the sin that wages war against your soul?

355
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 What's your plan?"

356
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Some of you are not planning to sin.

357
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 That's different than planning not to sin, or planning to not sin.

358
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 This is the most confusing thing I'm going to say tonight, but it's really important, so stay with me.

359
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 If you're not planning to sin, you're not planning.

360
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 It's this passive thing.

361
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 "I don't know. We're going to hang out. We're going to go see a movie. I'm not planning to sin."

362
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Oh, yeah.

363
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 That has never worked for anybody.

364
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 But if you're planning not to sin, or planning to not sin,

365
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 one, you're not planning. The other one, you're not sinning.

366
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 One, I'm not planning. The other one, I'm not sinning.

367
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I'm planning to not sin.

368
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Right? You're like, "Well, I'm going to go on vacation with my girl, man. It's going to be great.

369
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 We've been doing great with this purity thing. Got a hotel room. Two beds, though.

370
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Two beds. I'm not planning to sin."

371
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 You're right. You're not planning. Period.

372
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 You're not planning. That's what you're not doing.

373
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 You are not planning.

374
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Because that's very different than, "No, I'm going to go and I'm going to stay with a buddy.

375
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I'm going to put her up in a hotel. I'm going to stay with a buddy. I've got my boys texting me every hour.

376
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 They're going to call me. I'm going to call them before I go to bed."

377
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 I'm waging war against the sinful desires, which wage war against my soul.

378
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 I'm in a battle. I'm fighting.

379
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 I'm not going to do that. I'm going to make sure that I don't do that.

380
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Jesus matters way too much to me.

381
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 "Ah, man, I'm going on this bachelorette party.

382
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Hanging out with these girls. They're going to be doing all the things that I used to do.

383
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Not this time, though.

384
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 I'm going to go. I'm not planning to sin."

385
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 How are you planning to not sin?

386
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 "My girls text me. I'm not going to drink because I don't want to impair my judgment.

387
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 I'm going to make sure I'm on mission.

388
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Sharing with them how Jesus has changed my life.

389
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Texting my girls. Have them praying for me."

390
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Some of you are like, "Man, that doesn't sound like much fun."

391
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Man, being on mission is fun.

392
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Sharing Christ with your friends is fun.

393
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Bragging about how Jesus has changed your life is fun.

394
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Meaning bragging about Jesus, not yourself. That's fun.

395
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Watching people pass from death to life. That's fun.

396
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Seeing God, His Holy Spirit, change someone's eternal destination.

397
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 That's a whole lot of fun.

398
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 "I'm not planning to sin.

399
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 I'm planning to not sin."

400
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 One, you're letting your desires determine your plan.

401
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 The other, you're planning to not give in to your desires.

402
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Peter, he's been talking about growing up in the faith.

403
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 We missed, we skipped in chapter 1, verses 13 and 14.

404
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Let me read them to you now.

405
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Peter speaks circular. He says a lot of things over and over to make his point.

406
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 He says this, "Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober,

407
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at His coming.

408
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 As obedient children," so there's a simile there,

409
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 "like obedient children, as obedient children,

410
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.

411
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 But grow up in the faith."

412
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 As David told us last week, I've said it before,

413
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 a sign of maturity is not doing what you feel like doing.

414
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 A sign of immaturity is following your desires.

415
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 I've had three toddlers in the home.

416
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Three children I've raised through the Terrible Twos.

417
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 They're called the Terrible Twos because when they're two,

418
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 they do whatever they want to do.

419
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 They follow their desires.

420
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And it's Terrible Twos. But in young adult ministry,

421
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 I've seen Terrible 22s.

422
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Taylor Swift wrote a song about it.

423
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Terrible 22s. I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22.

424
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 So anyways, it's where you follow your desires.

425
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 We don't follow our desires. We seek God's.

426
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 You know everything, God.

427
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 What would you have me do?

428
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Live, verse 12, "Live such good lives among the pagans,"

429
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 unbelievers, those that don't know Christ,

430
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 "that though they accuse you of doing wrong,

431
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 "they may see your good deeds and glorify God

432
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 "on the day He visits us."

433
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 My third point is do good as an example to others.

434
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 You are to do good as an example to others.

435
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 We are examples to the pagans around us.

436
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 We're examples to a watching world.

437
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 I love doing weddings,

438
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 especially when people's lives have been changed here.

439
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 I love when their old friends are there,

440
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 their high school buddies and their bridesmaids are like,

441
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 "Man, you've just really changed."

442
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 It's so fun when God brings two followers of Christ together

443
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 in that covenant.

444
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And there's this growing trend here, which I'm for,

445
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 but it's where they haven't kissed until that moment.

446
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 And I get to say, "You're going to see this.

447
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 "You may kiss your bride for the very first time.

448
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 "They've never even kissed.

449
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 "How incredible, man."

450
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And people inevitably are like, "Man, that's weird."

451
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Which it's weird.

452
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 I'm gonna go ahead and tell you.

453
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 It's weird.

454
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Weird by definition is not normal.

455
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 It's extraordinary.

456
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Not normal.

457
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And I acknowledge, I'm like, "Man, that's weird."

458
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Let me tell you what's weird.

459
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 When you see that He has disciplined His body,

460
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 waged war with those desires,

461
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 which wage war against His soul,

462
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 and that He pulls that woman into that covenant relationship,

463
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 and He lays His life down for her to serve her,

464
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 to put her desires before His own.

465
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 That's what He's been practicing through the engagement,

466
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 putting God's desires in front of His own

467
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 and serving His bride-to-be.

468
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 It's a beautiful, amazing, incredible thing.

469
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And when you watch her,

470
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 when you watch her submit to His leadership

471
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 because of the way that He puts her first in all things,

472
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 that she has no other appropriate response to that

473
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 than to follow Him as He follows Christ.

474
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Man, it's weird.

475
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 When half the people are getting divorced

476
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 and another large percentage are unhappily married,

477
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 sleeping on couches,

478
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 not being intimate because they can't stand each other.

479
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And you see these two coming together,

480
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 loving each other 60 years from now,

481
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 still being unselfish toward one another.

482
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Man, it is weird.

483
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 It's crazy.

484
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Who won?

485
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Who won?

486
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 It's an example to a watching world.

487
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 We're examples.

488
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 And they love it when we fail.

489
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Pagans, man, they're watching you.

490
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 And when you fail, I mean,

491
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 that's news story kind of stuff.

492
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Another pastor falls.

493
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Another so-called Christian acting a fool.

494
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Here's what was really going on.

495
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 They're all hypocrites.

496
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 They love when you fail.

497
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 They're watching you.

498
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 A guy asked me the other day, he said,

499
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 "Hey, man, what's the best way to share the gospel with your family?"

500
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Because we agree, man, family's hard.

501
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Like family, that's a tough one.

502
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 He says, "Man, they know me.

503
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 They have seen me at my worst.

504
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And so, man, how do I share the gospel with them?"

505
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 And I just said, "Let me ask you a question.

506
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Have they seen you change?"

507
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Because that's the foundation of sharing the gospel with them.

508
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Displaying the change that Christ has brought in your life.

509
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 "Yeah, man, but listen, I'm not perfect."

510
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Exactly.

511
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 You're not perfect.

512
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 You need a Savior.

513
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 You need a process for when they see you not perfect,

514
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 that you go back to your mom and your dad,

515
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 and you look them in the eyes, and you say, "Hey, will you forgive me?

516
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 That's not who I am.

517
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 That's who I was.

518
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 You guys remember, that's who I was.

519
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 That's not who I am, though.

520
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Will you please forgive me for what I just did, for what I just said,

521
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 for how I just reacted, for how I just treated my siblings,

522
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 for how I treated you?

523
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Will you please forgive me?"

524
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And that process, that will minister to them.

525
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 You humbling yourself, showing them that you are led by another spirit,

526
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 not the spirit of this world.

527
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 And so who has God placed in your life so that you might be an example to them?

528
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Who has God placed you in their life so that they might come to know him

529
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 and glorify him on the day he visits?

530
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Which could mean their conversion.

531
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 It could mean when Christ comes back.

532
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 It could be this time right now between the first and second coming.

533
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Theologians disagree on what that means right there.

534
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 But as I thought about it and thought about how to teach it to you,

535
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 it doesn't change our application.

536
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 God is going to be glorified by your friends coming to know him in a greater way

537
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 by the things that you do around them.

538
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 That's what matters.

539
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 You're an example.

540
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 You may be the only Bible they ever read.

541
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 You may be the only verse they ever memorize.

542
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Watching your life.

543
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 There was a guy who discipled me.

544
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 He's an unbelievably godly man, knows the word,

545
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 sat down with me when I became a Christian.

546
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 And we just started in Genesis 1-1.

547
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 And we just started going verse by verse through the Bible.

548
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And he started teaching me.

549
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 He's one of these guys.

550
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 I mean, he loves his wife.

551
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 He disciples his children.

552
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 He's really cool, calm, and collective all the time.

553
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 He's just a spirit-led guy.

554
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 And I can't even imagine him as a pagan, but I've heard stories.

555
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 I've heard stories about how he just used to get wasted, how he used to party,

556
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 the way he used to treat girls.

557
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 But I can't even get my head around that because I only know the saved version of him.

558
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 And the way that it happened is he would go to these fraternity parties in college.

559
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 And he would just get, you know, plastered.

560
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 But he always saw these same two guys who never drank.

561
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 They were kind to everybody.

562
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Everybody liked them.

563
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 When people would make fun of them, they didn't seem to affect them at all.

564
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 They just kind of shrug it off, go about their day, and they were always having fun.

565
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 And he said he would see those same two guys all the time.

566
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 And one day he asked them, "Man, how do you do this?"

567
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 And he got to know those guys, and he got to know their Jesus.

568
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 And he became a Christian.

569
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 When I get to have--I don't know these guys.

570
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 I know the two of them.

571
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 But when I get to heaven, I'm going to find them, and I'm going to thank them

572
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 because they had a profound impact on my life even though we've never met.

573
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 Their example God used to save a man who poured his life into mine

574
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 so that I might teach you tonight.

575
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 How great is God?

576
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And so people trust Christians before they trust Christ.

577
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 People most often will trust a Christian before they will trust Jesus.

578
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 Jesus said it.

579
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Peter's just saying Jesus' words.

580
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 In Matthew 5:16, Jesus said it like this.

581
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 "In the same way, let your light shine before others that they may see your good deeds

582
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 and glorify your Father in heaven."

583
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 So there is something about the way that we act that is groundwork for the gospel.

584
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 As I think about all of these passages, and I think about my own life

585
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 and I just look back on the sins that I've given myself to--

586
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 if you don't know, if we don't know each other, I mean, I was an alcoholic, drug user,

587
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 porn addict, sex addict, just abuser of women in the way that I treated them.

588
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 And God came in, and he gave me something so much better.

589
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 But as I think about the times when my guard is down,

590
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 it's almost always when I forget that I'm not home.

591
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 It starts there.

592
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 I start trying to make this place my home.

593
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 I start pursuing my comforts.

594
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 I stop doing the things that I should do.

595
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 I stop prioritizing time with Jesus that particular morning.

596
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 I get in the afternoon, and I just want to be comfortable,

597
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 and I'm tempted to give into my flesh,

598
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 to invite the desires that wage war against my soul into my soul,

599
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 to lower my guard, and to invite guilt and shame to rule.

600
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 Christ has something better than that.

601
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 And so if you're here, you might be asking,

602
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 "Well, what if it costs me when I don't go to happy hour?

603
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Like I don't have that team camaraderie,

604
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 and they begin to talk about me like I'm weird,

605
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 and what if I remain single forever because I'm unwilling to date like he does

606
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 or dress like she does?

607
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 And what if I don't get the promotion because I won't go to the strip clubs?

608
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 And what if my family thinks that I spend too much time at church?

609
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 What if I suffer for doing good?"

610
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Here's how this chapter ends.

611
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 "If you suffer for doing good and you endure it,

612
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 this is commendable before God.

613
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 To this you were called because Christ suffered for you,

614
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 leaving you," underline this, "as leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps.

615
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 He committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth.

616
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 When they hurled insults at him, he did not retaliate.

617
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 When he suffered, he made no threats.

618
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.

619
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 He himself bore our sins.

620
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 He paid for our sins in his body on the cross

621
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness.

622
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 By his wounds you have been healed."

623
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 And so we're examples to others.

624
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 But we have an example in Jesus to follow.

625
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 And if you feel right now, listen, this is so important,

626
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 if you feel like right now, you're like, "Man, I can't. I'm just like a dog to his vomit.

627
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 I keep going back to the same sins, the same websites.

628
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 When I'm by myself, that desire is too big for me to fight.

629
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 I'm tired of fighting it.

630
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 I don't know how to win.

631
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 And I don't want to end this relationship.

632
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 I mean, you might call it an idol, but I call it love.

633
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 And we're going to see where this goes."

634
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 You know your struggle.

635
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 And you're like, "I can't win." You can't win.

636
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Jesus won for you.

637
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Jesus paid for it.

638
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 You have an example to follow.

639
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 You cannot win without following Christ.

640
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 You're a Christ follower, a Christian.

641
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 You have to keep your eyes on the author and the perfecter of our faith.

642
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Jesus Christ, who for the joy set before Him, endured the cross,

643
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 scorning its shame for you and for me.

644
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 He's the only one that's been here, that came from there,

645
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 to hear and endure this place,

646
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 who didn't do all the things that we shouldn't do,

647
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 and who lived the righteous life that we desire on our behalf.

648
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 I told you I love to travel.

649
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 And my favorite place is a place in Mexico,

650
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 kind of the Riviera Maya, Playa del Carmen area.

651
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 It's where I went for the first time on my honeymoon with Monica.

652
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 And so for the past 12 years, we've gone back every year.

653
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 And I kind of pride myself as being an expert on that area.

654
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 I mean, if I lost my job in ministry,

655
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 I think I'd go be a travel agent of sorts

656
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 and just help people plan their honeymoons in the Riviera Maya,

657
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 because I love it.

658
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 And my friend Elena, who's on staff here, is getting married this weekend,

659
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 and she's honeymooning in the Riviera Maya.

660
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 And she didn't ask me my opinion, which was extremely offensive.

661
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 And so I'm like, "Elena!" She's like, "I can't talk about it.

662
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 It's just too stressful. All the details are done."

663
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 So I go, and I book an appointment on her calendar.

664
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 I'm like, "We're going to talk about this."

665
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 And we sit down, and I'm like,

666
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 "What do you want to do on your honeymoon besides that?

667
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 What do you want to do on your honeymoon?"

668
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 And I'm like, "Where do you want to go?

669
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 Do you want adventure? Do you want relaxation?

670
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 What do you want it to look like?"

671
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 And she starts to tell me, "Well, we like to go and do a little bit,

672
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 but we want to relax a lot by the pool, by the beach."

673
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 I'm like, "Okay. What do you want to go and do?

674
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 Do you want to go see the culture of Mexico?

675
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 Or do you want to go see Mayan ruins?

676
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 Do you want to go to Coba, Tulum?

677
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 Or you could go to Ixcadet.

678
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 It's like this kind of Mexican Disney World.

679
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Or do you want zip lines?

680
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 Because we could go to explore.

681
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 It's some of the best zip lines I've seen.

682
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Or, oh, there's these cenotes right where you're staying.

683
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 A cenote is like an underground river

684
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 where you get in this tube,

685
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 and you go through this river that's underground

686
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 and you get stalactites and stalagmites.

687
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 Oh, one of my favorite places, Elena,

688
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 is Islamu Harris.

689
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 It's a 30-minute ferry ride from Cancun

690
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 where you're getting off.

691
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 You're going to be right there by the airport.

692
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 It's a $6 ferry ride. You get on the ferry.

693
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 You go to Islamu Harris.

694
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 It's where the Corona commercial was filmed,

695
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 if you've seen that. Beautiful beach, the sugar white sand,

696
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 the clear water, Islamu Harris.

697
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 You can take a golf cart.

698
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 What do you want to do?"

699
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 She'd be crazy not to talk to me.

700
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 [laughter]

701
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 Lots of times, as a foreigner,

702
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 I know what to do.

703
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 I know what not to do.

704
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 If you're going to endure this world,

705
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 you would be

706
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 out of your mind

707
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 not to spend

708
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 intentional time

709
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 with Jesus,

710
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 knowing His Word,

711
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 understanding what He says.

712
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 "Hey, here's where life is.

713
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 There's not life there.

714
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 The Christians are going to tell you

715
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 there's life there, and they're wrong.

716
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 You're going to find death

717
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 and divorce

718
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 there.

719
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 But if you go this way, as a stranger,

720
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 as an alien, as a weirdo,

721
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 as someone who's out of his mind

722
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 for the sake of the Gospel,

723
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 you're going to find life

724
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 in Jesus Christ alone.

725
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 Why wouldn't you do that?

726
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 If you didn't prioritize time with Him today,

727
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 you're going to wake up tomorrow,

728
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 I beg of you

729
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 to prioritize for the next 30 days.

730
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 Take a 30-day challenge.

731
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 If you hear this anywhere you are in the world,

732
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 I want to challenge you

733
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 to 30 days

734
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 of spending the first 30 minutes

735
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 of every single day,

736
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 not 5 days a week, 7 days a week,

737
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 the first 30 minutes,

738
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 I want you to carve out for Jesus.

739
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 If you're like, "I'm not a morning person,"

740
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 get some coffee or something.

741
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 But you prioritize

742
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 time with Jesus for the next 30 days.

743
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 If you're in on the 30-day challenge,

744
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 I want you to raise your hand.

745
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 I want you to say, "Hey, I'm in on the 30-day challenge.

746
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 I'm going to do it with you.

747
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 We're going to be doing it right together.

748
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 That's why thousands of hands go up.

749
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 All of us, for the next 30 days,

750
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 we're going to start our life

751
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 with Jesus.

752
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 And we're going to ask Him, "What do we do?

753
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 And what do we not do?

754
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 And would you remind me that I don't belong to this world?"

755
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 As we worship Him now,

756
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 I want you to beg Him for that.

757
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 Ask friends to hold you accountable.

758
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 Ask others, text them.

759
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 Say, "Heaven, I text you every morning after I spent time with Jesus."

760
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 If you fall off the bus,

761
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 get back on.

762
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Let me pray.

763
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Lord, we love you.

764
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 We do thank you so much for your example in Jesus Christ.

765
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 We thank you for the things

766
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 that you've taught us this evening

767
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 through your servant Peter.

768
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 For these two verses full of truth

769
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 that we can apply to our lives.

770
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 God, as friends gather

771
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 all over the country tonight

772
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 in El Paso and Tulsa

773
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 and Houston, the Woodlands, spring.

774
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 And my dear friends in Fort Worth,

775
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 God, would you renew our hearts

776
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 around the reality

777
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 that we don't belong to this world

778
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 in its current state.

779
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 You're going to perfect the world.

780
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 You're going to lay your kingdom here.

781
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 We're going to live in paradise

782
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 forever with you.

783
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 And Father, I know that there's friends

784
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 right now listening who have not trusted in you

785
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 through your provision

786
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 in Jesus Christ.

787
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 His death and resurrection is a payment for our sins.

788
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 So as we sing this song,

789
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 would your Holy Spirit

790
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 move into their hearts

791
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 and show them that you are the God,

792
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 the only God, the one true God,

793
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 the creator of the heavens and the earth

794
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 who have called them to know you.

795
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 Would you do that now, please, Lord.

796
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

797
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,600
 In Jesus' name, amen.
