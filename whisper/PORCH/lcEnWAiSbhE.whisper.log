[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (Music)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Well, a special hello all the way from San Antonio.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   (Cheers)
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   You've heard of it, yeah.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   It's like the most forgotten city in the state of Texas.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   But, man, it's a huge honor to get to be here tonight.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   And so whether you're here in this room or you're in Overflow,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   or maybe you're watching from one of the, gosh, 13 live sites,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   it's a joy to get to be here.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And I just want to say this to the Porch team and specifically David.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Man, just so grateful getting to watch what God has been doing here at the Porch.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And I don't know if you know this, but me and my wife and I,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   we lived in Washington State for about a decade.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And getting to watch what God is doing here among young adults is pretty supernatural.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And there's nothing like this that we've seen, I mean, in the entire U.S.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I hope you know that, that even the fact that you guys have Overflow,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   that this is a packed room, is absolutely incredible.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And I think a big piece of that, yes, is God moving in a really unique way,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   and you're a part of something really special.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   But it's also the leadership of the Porch that is, man, pushing forward
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and really defining how young adult ministry is being done across our nation.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   You guys are setting that pace.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And so thank you guys so much.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's an honor to get to be here tonight.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And real quick, I will, I'll do a trick.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Just because I feel like you won't listen until I do.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   But before I do, like David said, a year ago, my wife and I,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   we planted a church in San Antonio.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And I think I have a picture of my wife and my family.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Yeah, there's my wife, Jane, and that's our almost two-year-old daughter, Tilly.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I think there's another picture of Tilly.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Her eyes.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Listen, there's not another human on planet Earth
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   that I love more than that little kid.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And her name's Matilda, but we call her Tilly.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So now that we got the introductions out of the way,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   this is going to get weird.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Are you guys cool with that?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Is that okay?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Some of you tonight, you're going to walk out of this place,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   and you're not going to have heard anything that was said after this point.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And there will be many of you that walk out tonight a little upset and angry.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Some of you, you're going to love it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Some of you, not so much.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   If you walk out of this place angry, sorry.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   You've been kind of warned.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   But I'm going to need some volunteers that will be willing to help me out up here on stage.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And so we're going to grab a few.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Ma'am, you have your hand up.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Would you please join me up here?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Would you guys give her a huge round of applause?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Let's get somebody maybe over here, maybe a gentleman.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   We've got a young lady.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   We need a gentleman that's pretty--
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I need someone that's pretty--
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   you're just excitable.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You've got some energy.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   For real, you can do it, bro.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Wait, right here.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah, come on up.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   You guys get this guy with the white shirt right here.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Sorry.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Fella, white shirt, cap.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Oh, man.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   This is now awkward.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I tried.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I feel like I let you--
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Hey, you come on.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Maybe two active.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Hopefully we can reign you in.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Come on up.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Yeah, both of you, come on up here.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Ma'am, we're going to have you come here.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Sir, you here.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I want to know each of you guys.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Tell me your name.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Cameron.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Cameron, OK.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Cameron, what do you do?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I'm an ADT salesman.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I'm sorry?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   ADT salesman.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   No, I heard you.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Just sorry.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I'm just kidding.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I'm just kidding.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I'm kidding.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I always tell that joke.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   OK, tell me your name.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Sadie.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Sadie.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   We've got Cameron, Sadie.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Sadie, what do you do?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I'm a pre-K teacher.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Pre-K teacher.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Oh.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Bless your heart.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Man, I almost want to just stop and pray for you,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   because I know this season has been crazy.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So, well, here's what we're going to do.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   We're going to do a trick, and I'll be honest with you.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I've got a deck of cards.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   This is really important.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It's not a card trick, OK?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But what a deck of cards gives us tonight is it gives us 52 objects
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   that most people in this room are somewhat familiar with.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Correct?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Like you've played with a deck of cards.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Perfect.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   In a second, we're going to start with you, Cameron.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   We're going to have you select a card, OK?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Now, so that we're all on the same page tonight,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   this is really, really important.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   There are two parts to every playing card.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Yeah, you can take that off.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   There's the value of the card.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   That would be, let's say, like the number or the letter,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   if it's like a king or queen.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   That makes sense.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It's value.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And then there's the suit.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You got it?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   There are only four suits, so that we're clear.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   There are two red ones.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   There are two black ones.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   The two red ones are the heart and the diamond.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   The two black ones are the spade.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   That's like the little shovel thing, and then the upside-down heart.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And then there's the clubs, OK?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Or clovers, or puppy feet, depending on where you're from.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   OK, you got it?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   You'd be so surprised.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   There's just two.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   There's the value, and there's the suit.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   That's what you need to know, but people get lost.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   OK, now here's the deal.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   In just a second, like I said, I'm going to let you select a card.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Now, when people leave tonight, there's really only going to be one solution
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   that people are going to come up with.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So I'm going to go, Drew, either all of these cards--
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   you didn't have a whole lot of choices, maybe just two or three options.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So, Cameron, I need you to be honest.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I need you to look through there.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   They can see this with a camera.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   All of these cards are, in fact, different.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Can you see that?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Perfect.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   You can see this as well.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   OK?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   They're pretty shuffled, too.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   They're not in any special order, nothing like that.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Feel good?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Feel good?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yes.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   OK, super important.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   We'll start with you.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Cameron, I'm going to take my finger.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I'm just going to run through the cards like this.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I'm going to say, stop.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   OK?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You're going to take a look at the card and memorize it.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   If you feel as though I stopped too soon or too late and I'm forcing a card on you,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   or if you just don't like the card, tell me.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   OK?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Are we ready?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   A lot of setup.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I know, I know.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   You think you're nervous.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Just wait.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Here we go.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   You ready?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Just say out loud, say stop.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Stop.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Right there?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   How do you feel about-- nope, too far.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   OK, we'll start over.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Stop.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   How about this one?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Yep.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You feel good about this?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I feel good about this.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Can you memorize it?
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Thank you.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   You won't forget it.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I have a bad memory.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Can you memorize it?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Yep.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   You got it?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   OK, perfect.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Now, Cameron, I want you to look there at the back wall.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Yeah, that one.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   You don't have to point at everything.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   It's my show.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I'll tell the jokes, Cameron.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I want you to look there.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You're going to imagine-- you're going to start to-- all of a sudden, you're going to see
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   your card become an appearance.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I love that some of you turned around.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I love that some of you turned around.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I love that some of you turned around.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   It's just in his mind.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   You're going to see the value there.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   You'll see the suit.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   In your mind, say it over and again, not out loud, just in your mind, so that you don't
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   forget it.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Say it.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Are you ready?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Yes.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Same thing.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   If you would, just say stop.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Stop.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Right there, how do you feel about this?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Good.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   You feel good?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Yep.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   You won't forget it?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Nope.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Perfect.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Same thing.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Look there at the back of the wall.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Take it in your mind.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   OK.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Just over and over again.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Over and over again.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Perfect.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   OK.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Now, just to make this interesting, we're going to use a few of you in the crowd as
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   well.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   So, I tell you what, ma'am, you have this beautiful yellow dress.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Would you please stand up for me?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Would you tell me your name?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Paisley.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Paisley.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Beautiful name.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Paisley, in just a second, I'm going to take these cards.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I'm going to throw them to you.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   OK?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   If the rest of you catch these cards, here, this is how this is going to work.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   We'll just take the cards, put them face down in the palm of your hand.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Got it like this?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   You'll be able to take your thumb.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   You'll just peek open the cards.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Look there.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Memorize one.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It's fairly simple.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   It'll save us a little time.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   You can leave the rubber band around them.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Just, would you do me a huge favor?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Would you, I could throw them, but I'm kind of nervous.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   If you would, would you just take those cards, hand those to Paisley.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   OK?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Paisley, look right here at me.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   OK?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Look right here.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Look right here at me.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   OK?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Listen to my voice, not theirs.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   OK?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Look right here.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   OK.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Perfect.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Take your thumb.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I want you to peek open the cards.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Stay right here.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.920]   Once the cards are open, look there at the card.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.920]   Memorize it, both parts.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.920]   You got it?
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   OK.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   You can close it.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.920]   Look right here at me.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   In your mind, see the value and the suit.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   The value and the suit.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   Very good.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   Sir, tell me your name.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   Jordan.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.480]   Jordan, would you stand up real quick for me?
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.760]   Paisley, would you take underhand, would you toss those cards to Jordan?
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   Nice.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.000]   That was a great job.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Very cool.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   You can stay standing.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Stay standing.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Jordan, same thing.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Face down.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Look at the cards up with your thumb.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   When you've got them open.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Oh, no, don't do the top one.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I mean, you can, but go somewhere in the middle.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   It makes it more impressive.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   OK?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   You got one?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Got it memorized already?
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Close it.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Look right here at me.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Value, suit.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Value, suit.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   OK.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Let me have trouble with you.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And then let's go-- ooh, sir, you look super cool.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   You got this beard.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I love it.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Would you stand up?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Tell me your name.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Ryan.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Is that right?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   OK, perfect.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Jordan, it's a long way, so will you get it to Ryan?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Nice.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Oh, that was--
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Almost perfect.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Spin them around real quick.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Oh, flip it.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Oh, that'll make it easy.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Oh, spin it.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Like a wheel.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   There you go.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   There you go.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Look right here at me.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Look right here at me.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Whenever you're ready, Ryan, open the cards.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Look there at the card.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Memorize it.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Go ahead.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Do that now.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Got it?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Value, suit.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Value, suit.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Toss the cards here.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Nice.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   OK.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Jordan, you got it?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   You got it?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   OK.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Value, suit.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Toss the cards here.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Nice.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   OK, perfect.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Go ahead.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Stay standing.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Stay standing.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Jordan, stand up.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   OK, perfect.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   You're doing great.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   OK, now look.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Five cards.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   We're going to try to do this very, very fast, OK?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Here's what I need you to do.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.480]   Try your best to help me out, OK?
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.720]   If you go blank, this is not going to work.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.200]   It will all look a little awkward.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.780]   But try to focus as much as you can on your card.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.780]   This will help you.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.680]   I want you to imagine going back to like the halls of a high school.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   You're walking through the hall.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.320]   All of a sudden, you turn into a classroom.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   It's an art room.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.200]   I want you to see in the corner there's a canvas and there's an easel.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.000]   I want you to walk towards it in your mind.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.280]   And as you get close, you're going to see there's two markers.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.080]   There's a red marker, a black marker.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.760]   In your mind, would you grab the marker that you associate with your playing card?
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.760]   OK?
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   Don't do anything to give it away.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.760]   Perfect.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.760]   Perfect.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.760]   Perfect.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   OK.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.760]   Cameron, you reach down.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:35.080]   It will look like-- start with you.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.360]   OK?
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   Don't give anything away.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   It's either red or it's black.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.560]   It's either red or it's black.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   It's either-- very good.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   OK.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.560]   Your tails are in your eyes.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   Kind of, yeah, bump-- yeah.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560]   Black marker?
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   Yes.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.560]   Yes.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.560]   It's 50/50, but it's still impressive.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:55.560]   Cameron, right here.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.560]   Red, black, red, black, red.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.560]   Ooh.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.560]   Oh, there it is.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.560]   Red.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.560]   Perfect.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.560]   The rest, yes?
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.560]   Yeah, OK.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   Very good.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.560]   Right here.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.480]   Jordan, I'm kind of most nervous about you.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   You reach down there.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.200]   Is it a black marker?
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.000]   You can tell me.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   It's not a black marker.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Am I telling you it's a black marker?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Yeah, yeah, yes or no.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Just saying.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   It's a black marker.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It was.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   OK.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I knew we were going to have trouble with him.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   No, you're doing great.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Great, great.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Here's what we're going to do.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   We'll focus in.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Cameron, think about yours.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   OK?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   You know it's either a heart or it's a diamond.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.840]   It's either a heart or a diamond.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.840]   Very good.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.840]   OK?
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.840]   Very good.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.840]   Very good.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.280]   Focus in on the value of the card.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.920]   OK?
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:53.960]   I think I got it.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.240]   You guys got yours?
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.240]   Focus in on the suit.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.680]   Now, with the easel, here's what I want you to do.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.920]   You've got the red or the black marker.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.240]   I want you to begin to draw your card in your mind.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.440]   Draw the card in your mind.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.440]   Start to draw it.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.920]   I know yours is red.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.720]   I know it's also a diamond.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   OK?
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   Focus in on it.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.960]   Cameron, I believe the card that you're thinking of is the 10 of diamonds.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.960]   Is that correct?
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.960]   That is correct.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   Yes, you can have a seat.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960]   Well done.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.600]   The cards came pretty fast.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   This is what I saw.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.760]   The 7 of spades, the 10 of clubs, and the king of diamonds.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.720]   If I named your card, will you please have a seat?
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.560]   I don't know if you just saw that.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.840]   I don't know if you just saw that I just got 4 out of 4.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.560]   All that to say is if this doesn't work, obviously not my fault.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.560]   OK?
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.880]   At this point, all we know is that your card is black.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.880]   Focus in on it.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.880]   You're doing a great job.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.880]   I know, it's OK.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.880]   Look ahead.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.520]   Try your best not to give it away.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.080]   I'll tell you this up front.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.040]   The harder you try to not give it away, the easier you're going to make it.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.040]   OK?
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.040]   Here we go.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   Focus in on it.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   We know it's black.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.040]   It's a 7 of spades.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   It's a club or a 7 of spades.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.040]   Very good.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.960]   Oh, man.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.160]   Focus in on the number.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:28.840]   See, I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.880]   I think I have an idea, but I'm not 100%.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.880]   OK?
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.880]   So here's the deal.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.360]   If you get close, they're going to lose their mind for you.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:47.440]   The card that you begin to paint in your mind, it looked as though you began to draw a number.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.160]   The number that I think that you drew was some straight lines.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160]   It looked like maybe the 7 of clubs.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   7 of clubs, is that what it is?
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   If you guessed right, give her a huge round of applause.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.160]   Ta-da.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   Stop.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.160]   You don't mean it.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:23.080]   Well, how do you teach after that?
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.360]   I don't really have a great segue, so if you have a Bible, grab it.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.320]   Meet me in Acts chapter 4.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:37.200]   Actually, as you turn to Acts chapter 4, and feel free to look at the table of contents
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:43.120]   if you need to, but I want to say this.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.760]   What's interesting about magic and illusions and the way that it works is this.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:55.520]   Is that the secret to how that works was on full display on this stage right in front
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.800]   of you.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:02.660]   Like every detail of how it worked was literally right in front of you.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.920]   But you miss it because you're not trained to see it.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.960]   Or because of what magicians would call misdirection.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:15.080]   Your focus and your attention all goes here while the secret and the magic happens over
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.080]   here.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.960]   And here's the reason I share that tonight is this.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:27.520]   Because I believe with everything in me that not a single one of you are here by accident
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.520]   or happenstance.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:36.560]   Like whatever reason you walked into this place tonight, for whatever reason, you're
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.080]   not here by accident.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.000]   That I believe that the God of the universe has pieced things together and put you in
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.040]   the seat that you're in because he wants to speak to you tonight.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.520]   That he has something for you.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.280]   And more than you being here on purpose and with intention, that I believe that the God
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:00.000]   of the universe is here tonight and my fear is this.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.720]   Is that we would walk into a place like this and although his presence be on full display,
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.960]   that it be right in front of us.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.280]   Just like the magic trick, we miss it.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.160]   Just like the magic trick, our attention is diverted.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.280]   We spend so much time and worried about what people think about us.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.400]   Or maybe we're just here scoping and hoping and I hope I get a date out of this.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:29.600]   Or whatever this is, like that you completely miss the God of the universe showing up and
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:38.040]   showing off and wanting to speak to you in a language that your heart can understand.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:44.480]   And so tonight I want to pray for us and just ask God to speak to us in a really powerful
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.600]   and sweet way that maybe just maybe you understand.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:56.280]   So Jesus, I believe that you're here.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:02.760]   I believe that you're in this room and I believe that you have something in store for us all.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.240]   Myself included, God.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:12.680]   And I don't want to step into this space and you show up and then I miss it, God.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.160]   So I pray for every person in this space.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.560]   I pray for every person in the overflow, every person watching remotely, God.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.360]   Right now, would you open the eyes of our heart to see you?
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.560]   Would you open up the ears of our heart to hear you in a unique way?
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.360]   And God, I pray that we'd walk out of this place forever changed.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.880]   Not because some guy did a card trick, not because some guy taught well, but because
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.040]   you showed up and you spoke to your people.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   That's what we want.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.920]   That's what we need.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.360]   Not another talk.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.400]   We need your presence.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:54.480]   So speak to us tonight, Jesus, in a way that we can understand.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.480]   It's in your name we pray.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.480]   Amen.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:04.960]   Well, in Acts chapter four, my wife and I, we've just been walking through just a scripture
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.040]   app that's been chronologically just walking through the Bible and this was the passage
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.400]   that we read this morning.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.520]   So I was like, this will be sweet.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.200]   I'll just share this.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.920]   But I believe that there's something in this that we're going to see tonight that ultimately
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.480]   is the secret to how you and I experience a life to the fullest.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.960]   That Jesus shows up on the scene and in John 10, 10, he would say that I've come to give
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.600]   you life and life to the fullest.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.800]   But if we're honest, man, very few of us actually experience that type of life.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.800]   And so in Acts chapter four, we're going to start in verse one, but let me kind of set
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.200]   the stage so you know what's going on.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.760]   Acts is just really the story of the early church.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.560]   And you've got a couple of Jesus's followers who are hanging out and all of a sudden the
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.120]   Holy Spirit just descends on them.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.800]   They begin to just share the gospel and people's lives begin to get changed.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.520]   And Peter and John, two of these disciples, these followers of Jesus are on their way
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.200]   to the temple, on the way to a church service, a lot like the porch.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.200]   And they come in contact with a beggar, a lame beggar, can't walk, who's been outside
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   of the temple.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.600]   The scripture is going to tell us that he's about 40 years old and he's been there for
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.920]   majority of his life.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920]   So he's pretty well known.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.880]   And if you've got to think about it, if you're going to beg for money, doing it outside of
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.480]   a church is not a bad place to do it.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.840]   And so Peter and John are walking towards the temple.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.880]   They come up to this lame beggar.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.880]   He asked for money.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.940]   They kind of bypass him for a second and then they stop, they pause, they turn and they
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:30.940]   look at him.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:36.720]   And they're thinking like this lame beggar is like, cha-ching, here we go, payday.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.240]   And Peter and John, these two men look at him and go, "Hey, listen, silver and gold,
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.440]   we don't have it.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.460]   But what we do have, we give freely in the name of Jesus, get up and walk."
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.420]   And all of a sudden the muscles in this man's leg begin to like strengthen and his legs
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.280]   begin to like straighten.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.440]   And he stands up for the very first time and he begins to walk.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.360]   And the Scripture tells us not only that, he's kind of skipping, he's almost dancing
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.360]   to the people in the synagogues are paying attention going, "What in the world?
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.560]   Like we know this guy, how did this happen?"
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.280]   And so they begin to point to Jesus and lives begin to be changed.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.600]   It's causing this great commotion.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.360]   And so then the religious leaders at the time grab Peter and John because they're causing
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.620]   all this commotion.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.720]   They throw them in prison and they're like, "What do we do?
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   It's pretty late.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.360]   Maybe we should deal with it tomorrow."
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.520]   And that's where we find ourselves in this story.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520]   Got it?
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   Perfect.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.040]   So chapter four, verse one, this is what it says.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.560]   It says, "The priest and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.520]   Peter and John while they were speaking to the people."
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.120]   Just side note, Sadducees are the religious leaders of the day.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.320]   Fun fact, they're the ones who put Jesus on trial and put him on this kind of this, this
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.920]   whole false witness.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.060]   And they're ultimately the ones that execute him.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.040]   And so the Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.640]   And that you'll see that's kind of just a fun fact.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.880]   Verse two says, "They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.340]   and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.440]   So they seized Peter and John because it was evening.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.840]   They put them in jail until the next day.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:25.500]   But many who heard the message believed and the number of men grew to about 5,000.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.600]   The next day the rulers and elders and teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.920]   And I as the high priest was there.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:38.280]   And so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and the other men of the high priest family.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them by what power or
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.840]   what name did you do this?
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.580]   And then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit said to them, 'Rulers and elders of the people,
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.980]   if we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a cripple or asked
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:03.200]   how he was healed, then know this, you and all the people of Israel, it is by the name
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.280]   of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified, but whom God raised from the dead that this
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.040]   man stands before you healed.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.800]   He is the stone that you builders rejected, which has become the capstone.'"
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:22.540]   And verse 12, watch this, "Salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:28.520]   under heaven given to men by which we must be saved."
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:34.080]   If you're taking notes tonight, man, point number one, the secret of life is this, that
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.280]   the message has to be clear.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.280]   Your message has to be clear.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.580]   Now real quick, one of my favorite things, we moved to San Antonio about three years
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.760]   ago and was so grateful to move back to the south because you guys have, my wife and I's
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.980]   favorite restaurant in the world, a place called Chick-fil-A.
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.720]   And we love it, absolutely love it.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.320]   So do they.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.120]   But Chick-fil-A, listen, and most of us, we do, we love it.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.040]   And there might be some different camps and maybe divided a little bit on maybe the sauce
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.740]   choice or maybe it's like, hey, it's sweet tea versus lemonade, or maybe it's like the
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.600]   Chick-fil-A sandwich versus the nuggets.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.480]   But here's what's interesting.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.000]   The vast majority of us love it really, really well.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.560]   And somehow, someway, Chick-fil-A is hired like two renegade cows that are vandalizing
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.200]   billboards all across the southeast.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:34.400]   And no matter what place you find yourself, whatever side you find yourself, all of us
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.480]   in this room know Chick-fil-A's slogan.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.920]   It's three simple words.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.400]   You know it, right?
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.560]   Eat more chicken.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.040]   Why do you know that?
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:54.580]   Because Chick-fil-A's message is unbelievably clear.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.120]   Unbelievably clear.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:04.820]   And what is sad is this, that the world in which we live right now is dying for the answers
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.240]   that you and I claim to have.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:15.440]   This about the hope that we claim to have, and sadly, the church right now finds itself
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.200]   stuttering.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.600]   It finds itself confused.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.720]   And so it's no matter that even in your own heart, when you think about the message that
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.680]   you've given your life to, that you claim to be, man, I've given my whole life to Jesus,
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.800]   surrendered everything to it.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:39.520]   But why is it that the message is so unclear, even for our own hearts?
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.200]   We don't necessarily really even know what exactly it is that we're living for, some
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   of us.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:51.880]   Now listen, I didn't grow up in the church, so I didn't know like most of this stuff.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.280]   I remember sitting down with a youth pastor when I was almost a senior in high school,
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.320]   and he goes, "Drew, can I just ask you a few questions?"
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.320]   I'm like, "Yeah, shoot for it."
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.160]   And I was like, "Hey," he's like, "what do you know about the Bible?"
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:09.200]   I was like, "Ah, I'm pretty sure Jesus is like the main character."
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   He's like, "Yeah, good."
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.920]   And he goes, "Drew, can I tell you this, or can I ask you this?
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.360]   If I could tell you the whole story in just three or four minutes, would you want to know?"
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.400]   And I was like, "Yeah, bro.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.840]   Like you bought lunch, sure, I'm listening."
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.280]   And listen, I'll never forget what he said.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   He said, "Drew, in the very beginning of this book was just God, in perfect relationship
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.000]   with himself, and there was nothing else.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.080]   And God begins to speak the world into existence, creates all things with just His words.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.960]   On the sixth day, God reaches into the dirt and He forms mankind.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.200]   It would be the first thing that God ever touches.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.280]   He breathes life into man."
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   Why?
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.720]   So that we would have this opportunity to have this intimate, deep relationship with
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.320]   the God of the universe, that we could be fully known, fully loved, fully treasured
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320]   by Him.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.000]   And we make it three chapters into the book before we totally screw it all up.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Then we go, "God, hey, thanks, but no thanks.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.400]   Like I want to be king, I want to be captain, so would you just slide off the throne and
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.800]   let me take charge?"
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.880]   And in that moment, sin entered into the world and it fractured it.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.880]   It broke it.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:37.680]   In real talk, listen, I don't have to convince you of that.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.200]   You don't watch the news for very long or flip through Twitter before you're like, "Yeah,
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.280]   it's pretty broken.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.280]   It's jacked up.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.080]   Surely this isn't the way God intended it."
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.760]   Or better yet, listen, love my daughter, she's about to hit two.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.160]   Listen, you don't have to hang out with a two-year-old very long before you're like,
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.080]   "Dang, that's like the most evil creature on planet earth right there."
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   Amen?
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.800]   But here's what's interesting, think about this.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.320]   My wife and I, we don't sit down with Tilly and go, "Hey, listen, when you don't get your
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.280]   way, you need to bite people.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.320]   Let me show you how to do that.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.080]   When you get frustrated, throw a punch.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.080]   Like scream."
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.080]   No, no, no.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.560]   That's inside of her.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.560]   She's born with it.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.880]   That's her default setting that every single one of us, that's where we find ourselves,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.960]   that the sin of our great, great grandparents have been passed down from father to son,
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:37.320]   mother to daughter, and it's in every one of us, like a cancer, a plague that's killing
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   us.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:44.760]   In the entire Old Testament, although it's filled with a bunch of really crazy stories,
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:51.640]   it's all just one giant promise, and this is the promise that God sees you in your brokenness,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.120]   and He loves you too much to leave you there.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.920]   And one day, He's sending a hero to fix every bit of it.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.600]   And so when you turn the pages from Malachi into Matthew, or Old Testament into the New
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:10.200]   Testament, you see that the hero actually shows up, but it's not what anyone expected.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:16.280]   Because the hero was actually God Himself that was willing to leave His throne room,
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:22.200]   His kingdom, wrap Himself in human flesh, and move into our trailer park.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.040]   That's who Jesus was.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.480]   Like God in the flesh.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.480]   God incarnate.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.680]   So we call Him Emmanuel at Christmas, because God is with us.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   He's here.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.680]   He's present.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:39.720]   He walks on earth for 33 perfect years, teaching us what it means to be fully human, fully
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.120]   alive.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.040]   And then He willingly lays His life down on our cross.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   Don't miss that.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   That wasn't Jesus' cross.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.120]   It was yours.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.040]   That was our death penalty for our treason against the God of the universe.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.680]   And He willingly lays His life down on that cross, crucified, placed into a tomb, and
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.040]   then three days later, He walks out of the grave, proving that He has the power over
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.880]   sin and death, and all who call upon the name, all who take their lives like Texas Hold 'Em
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.960]   style and push the chips in and say, "It's all yours.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.880]   I'll step off the throne.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.480]   You be the captain.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.060]   You call the shots."
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:21.440]   In that moment, something miraculous happens.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:29.360]   The Bible would tell us this, that we go from being enemies of God, slaves to our sin, and
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:36.120]   the moment we say yes to Him, that we get adopted into the family, no longer orphans,
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:41.880]   but now sons and daughters of the King of the universe.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.680]   That's our message.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.680]   That's our message.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.840]   Porch, hear me.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.680]   Do not leave this place thinking that the message of Christianity is that Jesus came
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.440]   to this earth to take bad people and make them good people.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.200]   That's not Christianity.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.280]   Christianity is that Jesus came to take dead people and bring them to life.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.720]   That's what it means to follow after Jesus.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.200]   And our message has to be clear.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:20.960]   Listen, not just to the world around us, but to us, but to ourselves.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.880]   You know why many of us live such defeated lives?
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.440]   Because that's not the story we believe.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.520]   We think, "Man, Jesus, you just came here to help me not cuss as much.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:38.440]   Didn't you die on the cross just so I would watch a few less rated R movies?"
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.960]   Like we joke, right?
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.240]   But that's what many of you believe by your actions.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:50.480]   What if you really did begin to believe that the same power that rose Jesus Christ from
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:56.640]   the grave now, of course, is through your veins, and that you can live a life of victory?
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.200]   We're running out of time.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.560]   Point number two is this.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.320]   Not only does the message need to be clear, but also we'll see that these men were marked
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   by Christ.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.720]   In verse 13, it says, "When they saw," so the Sadducees saw the courage of Peter and
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.840]   John and they realized that they were unschooled, uneducated, ordinary men.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.240]   They were astonished and took note that these men had been with Jesus.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.360]   But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.000]   nothing they could say.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.440]   So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and confer together.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.160]   "What are we going to do with these men?" they ask.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.360]   Everybody living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle and we can't deny
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   it.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.280]   But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn these
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.320]   men to speak no longer to anyone in this name.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   So point number two is this.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.960]   They were marked by Christ.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.640]   They were marked by Christ.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.920]   These religious leaders look and go, "Hey, listen, those two guys, here's what's obvious.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.880]   Listen, they're not very educated, they're not real smart, they're unschooled, but here's
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.040]   what's really clear.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.760]   Those guys been with Jesus.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.680]   How do they know that?
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   Think about this.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.440]   When Jesus was put on the cross, the disciples, they all peaced out.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.640]   Like none of them were around.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.360]   How was it obvious that those two guys had been with Jesus?"
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.080]   Well, let me paint it this way.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:24.800]   Right after I graduated college, I jumped in a car with a musician named Josh and we
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:30.200]   spent a year and a half touring around America, just making loops around the US.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.800]   Eventually, we would move to Washington.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   We ended up planning a church together and would serve together for a decade.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.320]   So we go to college together, we spend all this time together.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.940]   Now here's the deal.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.240]   If I were to invite Josh out on the stage, which he's not here, he's in Washington still,
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.180]   but if I were to invite him out and we would get a chance to hang out or maybe go grab
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.880]   coffee afterwards.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.600]   Couple things that you would notice pretty quick.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.000]   You're like, "Dang, Drew, you and Josh are super similar.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.040]   Like you talk a lot alike.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.200]   You have the same inflection, like same mannerisms.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:06.880]   You tell a lot of the same stories and jokes, most of which he stole from me."
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.320]   And so, but here's the deal.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.760]   Why does that happen?
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.480]   Why is that true?
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   It's not because we set aside and go, "Hey, let's practice our moves here.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.760]   Like how do you do your hand when you talk?
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.600]   Like is that how it works for you?"
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.400]   No, no, no.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:28.120]   The reason that we're so similar is because we spent every single waking moment for a
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:34.640]   year and a half living together side by side in a car.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.080]   Why was it so obvious that these men had been with Jesus?
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:45.840]   Is because for every single waking moment of their life for three solid years, they
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.440]   were side by side with Jesus.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.040]   It was obvious those guys have been with Jesus.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.480]   They talk just like Him.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.760]   They've got the same mannerisms, the same stories they tell.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.360]   It's just like Jesus.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.760]   It's obvious that they've been with Him.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:09.960]   So then maybe the million dollar question for you and I is this, is it obvious that
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.600]   we've been with Jesus?
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.400]   Are we marked by Christ?
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:21.440]   When your coworker looks at you, when your friends hang out with you, is it obvious that
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.760]   you've been hanging out with Jesus?
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.160]   To go, "Hey, listen, the real talk, I don't know if I believe in all of this stuff.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.080]   I don't know how I feel about Jesus, but here's what I do know.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:36.560]   If He was on earth, I'm willing to bet He'd talk a lot like you do.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.160]   I'm willing to bet He'd live like you do.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.200]   I'm willing to bet He would love like you do, that He would listen like you do, that
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.440]   He would care like you do.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.560]   That it's obvious that you've been with Jesus.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.440]   And here's the deal, church, please don't miss this.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.040]   It's not about performance.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.600]   It's all about proximity.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:05.160]   That over time as you walk with Jesus, as you build intimacy, and you begin to look
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:11.120]   more and more like Him, the pieces of you that look like you begin to fade away and
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.480]   He begins to step into the spotlight.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.880]   Church, is it obvious that you've been with Him?
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.520]   It breaks my heart to think that the vast majority are going to leave this place tonight
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.200]   and what you're going to hear is you need to leave this place and start performing.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.760]   Start doing more theater, acting more like Jesus.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.680]   That's where we get the idea of hypocrisy, that it's just theater.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:44.800]   But as you walk with Jesus, as you know Him intimately, He begins to change you.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.720]   Listen, and this is going to, some of you aren't going to believe this and I'm okay
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.120]   with it.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:36:01.360]   The love of Jesus is more real than the chair you're seated in right now.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:09.520]   Jesus is not a philosophy or a theory or something that you subscribe to.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:14.720]   It's actually something and someone you can experience.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.020]   And it breaks my heart to think that the vast majority of us are going to continue playing
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:23.760]   a game and missing out on that love that He offers.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.460]   The third thing is, not only is the message clear and marked by Christ, but they were
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.120]   motivated by the cross.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.280]   They were motivated by the cross.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:42.200]   In verse 18 it says, "Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.360]   teach at all in the name of Jesus.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   But Peter and John," I love this, "replied, 'Judge for yourselves whether it is right
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:53.960]   in God's sight to obey you rather than God, for we can't help speaking about what we've
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.400]   seen and heard.'
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.360]   And after further threats they let them go.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.640]   They could not decide how to punish them because all the people were praising God for what
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:07.560]   had happened, for the man who was miraculously healed was over 40 years old."
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.440]   So listen, the religious leaders pull Peter and John aside and they go, "Hey guys, come
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.440]   here real quick.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.440]   We're going to chat with you."
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.440]   They go, "Here's the deal.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.920]   We're going to let you go to kind of keep things from getting a little crazy, but here's
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.360]   what we need you to do.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.760]   This whole Jesus stuff, we need to keep it on the DL.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.720]   A little hush-hush if you don't mind.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.040]   And if we don't mention this again, we'll be cool."
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.480]   And Peter and John's response in that moment is, "Hey listen, that's ultimately between
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.600]   you and God.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.920]   He gets to decide that.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.560]   But here's what we know for certain.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.160]   We can't help but speak about the things that we've seen and heard.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.000]   Like our minds have been blown.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.940]   Like our lives have been touched in a drastic way and we can't help but talk about the things
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.040]   that we've seen and we've heard."
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:57.880]   Church, it is the thesis of my life that I believe that if you're in this room and you,
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:03.040]   you really love Jesus, not just an idea of it, like you really love Him, you're a follower
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:10.600]   of Him, then the only reason that you're still here on planet Earth is because God has left
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:16.440]   you with an assignment and a mission to carry into the world.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.080]   Just real talk, let's think about this.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.520]   Like if you love Jesus, like that moment that you push all the chips in, why not in that
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.680]   moment do you not get zapped up into heaven to be with Him?
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.440]   Like why not?
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.800]   Like think about this.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:36.400]   That would be a much better deal than what we've got going on down here.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:45.240]   Like as amazing as the porch is, and it's incredible, as amazing as the DFW area is,
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:56.000]   and to be in the throne room with King Jesus, to be fully known, to be fully loved, to be
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:04.920]   truly seen for who you are and completely accepted, no hurt, no pain, no cancer, no
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.600]   fear, no anxiety, no worry, no stress, like are you kidding me?
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.800]   That's a much better deal than what we've got going on down here.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.600]   So why leave us here?
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.360]   Because He's not done.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:28.400]   Because He rescued your heart and He sent you into the world motivated by everything
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.280]   that you've seen Him do in your life.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.600]   Now, love, I've heard it said this way, the gospel just hit you on its way to someone
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   else.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:42.800]   But check this out, what if God so loves the people in your office space that He rescued
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.200]   and redeemed your heart and then He left you there so that you could share the gospel with
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   Him?
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.640]   Because I love them so much that I'm not gonna pull you out.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:56.480]   I'm gonna leave you there so that you can pass on that love, so that you can share that
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.240]   with them.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   Think about this.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.960]   And once again, it's not about performance, it's not about duty.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.800]   Like these men, like they were threatened with their lives and they go, "Hey, we can't
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.040]   help but speak about it."
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.040]   Think about Isaiah.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.280]   Some of you may remember this story.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.920]   In Isaiah chapter six, there's this moment where this very broken man comes face to face
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.080]   with the God of the universe.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.640]   He sees Him, high lifted on His throne, and he goes, "Oh man, like I'm screwed up, like
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.480]   I'm messed up, I've got a lot of issues, like don't kill me."
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.340]   And God heals him, forgives him.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:36.320]   And then God asks this question, "Who, who we send?
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.600]   Who's gonna go into the world and tell them about my goodness?
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   Who's gonna tell them about my love?
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.360]   I have a rescue plan just for them."
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:53.760]   And if you ever go back to that passage, I want you to know what it doesn't say.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.040]   Isaiah doesn't have a moment where he goes, he looks around and he's like, "Ah, I guess
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.400]   it's just me.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.680]   I guess I'm the only Christian in the office.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.720]   I guess I'm the only one in the social club that loves Jesus, so I guess, I guess me.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.720]   I'll do it."
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   No.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.080]   There's, there's an exclamation point by the end of his statement where it's like he steps
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.160]   up to the plate and he goes, "No, no, no, no, God, here I am.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   Here I am.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.160]   You send me.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.640]   God, you could send anybody.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.960]   Anybody could go, but I'm asking you, send me.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.040]   God, I've seen your beauty.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.840]   I've seen you to be a treasure that you promised to be.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   Like send me.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.840]   I'll go.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.040]   I'll tell the world.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.480]   I'm motivated by what you've done for me, that you've rescued me.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   You've redeemed me.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   I was once an enemy.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.800]   I was once a slave, but now I'm alive.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   I'm adopted.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   I'm your son.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   I'm your daughter.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   Send me, please.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.980]   You don't have to.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:59.320]   You could send anybody, but God, you left me here and I want to tell them, I want to
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:06.120]   tell them, God, send me.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:17.760]   A couple years ago, I was at an event much like this, and at the time I was just doing
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:25.560]   magic and I'm sitting in the back and watching people worship and I'm watching this gentleman
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.160]   just lose his mind.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:31.720]   I mean, hands up, I mean, he's just going for it.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.720]   Like no one else in the room.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.080]   Like it was obvious.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.120]   And so there was something stirring in me and this probably wasn't smart, but I just
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.160]   kind of walk over and I was like, hey, listen, I just kind of tap him on the shoulder.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:50.160]   I'm like, hey, bro, I hate to bother you, but I need to know, what's the secret?
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.200]   And what's the secret?
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:43:04.480]   What is it that allows you to worship Jesus with such reckless abandonment?
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.320]   Like nobody else in the whole room.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:20.160]   And all of a sudden, he responds this way, what do you mean I'm the only one in the room
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.240]   worshiping this way?
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.320]   It was in that moment that one of the moving lights swings across the audience and I notice
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:31.760]   that there's this massive glaze over his eyes.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:37.400]   I go, man, I'm so sorry to ask, but are you blind?
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.440]   He's like, yeah.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:49.120]   And it was in that moment that God dropped a message in my heart.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:55.920]   This was a young man that maybe he couldn't see with his eyes, but his heart was fully
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.440]   open.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:04.880]   For him, the message was so clear that God had rescued and redeemed a broken person just
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.880]   like him and adopted him into the family.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:11.600]   For him, it was so obvious that he was marked by Christ, that he loved Jesus, not just in
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.160]   a moment, not just to sing a song, but the rest of his week, the rest of his month, the
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.320]   rest of his year was spent walking with Jesus.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:24.000]   And it was obvious that he was motivated by what God had done in his life.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.640]   Church, this is my prayer for each and every one of you.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:41.600]   And maybe so, would you know that this is the life that Jesus invites you into?
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.120]   And would you know that he is absolutely worth it?
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.320]   He really is a treasure.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.560]   He really is.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:57.320]   He really is everything that he claims to be.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:07.300]   Please don't spend all of your time playing church, playing Christianity, and missing
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:13.240]   the life that Jesus invites you into.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:20.000]   Jesus, we love you.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:27.920]   And Jesus, I have no idea the stories of the people in this room, but I know that you do.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.240]   I know that you are good.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.440]   I know that you love them.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.160]   I know that you have a plan for them.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.440]   I know that you're inviting them into something deeper.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.520]   And so God, I pray that they wouldn't miss out on that.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.080]   God, I pray that I wouldn't miss out on that.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:48.560]   That I wouldn't get so busy playing the role of a Christian, playing the role of a pastor,
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.680]   that I miss out on the intimacy that you invite me into.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:59.280]   So Jesus, for every person in this room, I pray tonight that they would walk out of this
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:04.040]   place with the message, with your message unbelievably clear in their heart.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.200]   No matter where they land, no matter where they are spiritually, would the message be
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.160]   clear to them.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:16.240]   God in the days to come, I pray that you would mark them with your presence, overwhelm them
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.240]   with your presence.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:24.280]   And God, I pray that you would motivate them such at a deep level of what you've done for
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.280]   them.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:30.440]   And then you would send them into the world to be agents of hope and reconciliation and
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:34.320]   change in this world.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.280]   We love you, Jesus.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.280]   We trust you.
