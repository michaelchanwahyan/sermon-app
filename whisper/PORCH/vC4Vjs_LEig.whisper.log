[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:32.840]  , Good evening, Porch. Great to be with you.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.240]   We're going to start a new series tonight.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.320]   And so I'm so glad that you guys are here.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.640]   If you're guests with us, if you're
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.800]   listening in for the first time, we're so glad you're here.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.880]   If you frequent West 7th in Fort Worth, or Baker Street,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.880]   or Midtown, or here in Dallas, Uptown, or Lower Greenville,
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.920]   and somehow you stumbled into this place,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.040]   you're in a great place, that's actually my story.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.400]   That's how I got here a little over a decade ago.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.960]   And God just came in and began to do work on my heart.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.160]   And so I'm so excited to be in this new series called
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.080]   AD with you this evening.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.680]   And so as I share that story with you,
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.520]   I'll tell you that on my 21st birthday,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.000]   I was not walking with Jesus.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.520]   I was not a believer.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.080]   I was not a Christian.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.680]   And my boys wanted to celebrate.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.120]   And so on my 21st birthday, I wanted
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.640]   to do what a lot of people who turn 21 want to do,
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.440]   is I wanted to go gamble, okay?
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.320]   And so I wanted to go big too.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.960]   I wanted to go and I wanted to hear the sounds
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.320]   of the slot machines and see the lights.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.040]   And I wanted my chance at winning a million dollars.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.320]   And I didn't have very much money.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.280]   And so I'm like, man, this is what I wanna do.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.960]   And so my boys came over and you know where we went, right?
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.400]   I mean, we went, that's right, Shreveport, that's right.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.920]   And so, (laughs)
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.720]   and so that's how we did.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.720]   And so we went over there and it wasn't kind to me.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.600]   And so I lost all the money that I went in there with.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.720]   And as I walked out with my head hanging low,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.000]   I had a $5 chip sitting in my pocket.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.600]   And so I don't wanna go to the place
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.720]   where you do the exchange.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.680]   And maybe you guys don't know what I'm talking about,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.180]   but there's this place where you do this exchange.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.460]   And I get a $5 bill.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.360]   So I'm like, man, I'm gonna let it ride.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.200]   I'm gonna go.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.280]   And so I go to the roulette wheel,
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.800]   and that's a game where you can kind of bet
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.160]   on a number or red or black, okay?
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.360]   And so I put my $5 chip on red, which is easy enough.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.040]   It's $5 and I'd lost everything.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.400]   And so, and winner, awesome, awesome, 10 bucks, okay?
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.920]   So I got 10 bucks now.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.320]   And so you double your money.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.960]   And so I let it ride.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.560]   Hey, I'm gonna leave that out,
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.160]   push that 10 bucks back across the line.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.900]   You know, try my luck, put it back on red.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.040]   Winner, come on.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.140]   20 bucks, you know, this is awesome.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.200]   Hey, I'm not gonna stop now.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.860]   I mean, it was 20, maybe I should.
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.440]   No, no, man, let it ride.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.220]   Let's see what happens.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.060]   Marble drops, wheel spins, lands on red.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   $40, this is real money now.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.720]   I'm like climbing, I'm climbing back up the ladder.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.780]   You know, I can't stop now.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.160]   Like this, I've gotta, what am I gonna do with it?
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.820]   So I'm sitting there and now it's a little more difficult
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.860]   to put, I mean, you know, I'm 21 years old.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.560]   I am kind of just moved to Dallas.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.800]   I'm looking at opportunities.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.080]   The bank account is nil and I got 40 bucks
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.900]   in front of me now.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.240]   Okay, what do I, let's go.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.880]   Let's play, let's play ball.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.220]   Push it across the line, bet the 40,
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.840]   and it lands on red.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.320]   This is the easiest money I've ever made in my life.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.880]   Like this is the easiest game.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.980]   Like I'm so good at this, right?
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.800]   But now, here's the problem ensues
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.840]   because now there's $80 in front of me.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.120]   And if $40 felt like real money,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.360]   $80 feels like real, real money.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.120]   And so I'm thinking, okay, I don't know.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.920]   And now all of a sudden I begin to have this mental narrative
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.760]   and I can't push, I can't bring myself to come to a place
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.360]   where I push that money out there.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.520]   I can't risk it.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.360]   I can't go all in because it feels like the stakes
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.680]   are too high.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.940]   And as I think about what Jesus is calling us to,
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.640]   and not just us, but when Jesus was on the earth,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.720]   God in the flesh, the incarnate God,
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.040]   that means God with flesh put on him,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.440]   is walking around and he's interacting with people
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.440]   and this literally happened in a real place
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.520]   with real people, real human souls.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.680]   He had one message over and over and over.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.980]   And that message was, go all in with me.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.680]   I want you to go all in with me.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.800]   And as we move through this series AD,
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.480]   we're gonna see people who did that.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.800]   Tonight, we're gonna look at someone who didn't,
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.180]   who couldn't because it felt like to this individual,
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.680]   the stakes were too high.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.720]   Jesus, I can't.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.840]   I can't bring myself to push my life across the line
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.380]   and go all in with you.
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.560]   I just can't seem to do it.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.280]   And so we're in a series AD that stands for Anno Domini.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.080]   It is medieval Latin for the year of the Lord.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.840]   The year of the Lord.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.600]   Okay, here's what's interesting about that.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.080]   We've been in a series called BC,
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.160]   stands for before Christ AD.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.140]   This is how our Gregorian calendar operates.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.720]   And what should encourage you is that is the calendar
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.560]   that the vast majority of the world uses.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.200]   We are counting back 2016 years
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.720]   from the year of the Lord, BC, before Christ.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.440]   Jesus Christ comes on the scene.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.040]   AD was shortened from the year of the Lord, Jesus Christ.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.360]   They drop off the Jesus Christ, just AD, Anno Domini.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.720]   And here we are, and every atheist you know
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.040]   uses this system to date their checks
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.160]   on their Microsoft Outlook calendar.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.320]   It is counting forward from the birth
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.240]   of a man named Jesus Christ.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.600]   He was that significant, born in Bethlehem,
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.520]   lived in Nazareth, and you shouldn't know him
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.680]   except for he was God.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.200]   And every Muslim, and every Hindu,
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.720]   and every Buddhist, and every Jew you've ever met
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   in Dallas, Texas, dates their calendar
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.280]   2016 years from this man's birth.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.620]   And so what we're gonna do for the next few weeks
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.960]   is we're going to look at real live interactions
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.800]   of him coming face to face with human beings
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.120]   and challenging them, and we're going to learn
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.220]   from those stories.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.980]   And so tonight, we're asking the question
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.400]   or looking at what will keep us
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.440]   from going all in with Jesus.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.000]   What will keep us from going all in with Jesus?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.520]   Because some of us are here this evening
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.480]   and we don't think Jesus is a safe bet.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.960]   And so you've gone all in on the world.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.080]   Others of you, you've hedged the bet.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.320]   You've put $5 on Jesus and $5 on the world,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.120]   and you think you've learned how to win the game
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.460]   and you're gonna lose both.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.360]   In fact, you're losing both.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.800]   Because you have too much Jesus to enjoy the world
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   and too much of the world to enjoy Jesus,
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.400]   and you're losing both games.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.340]   It's not working out for you.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:59.160]   And so what does it look like to go all in with Jesus?
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.260]   We're gonna look at three things.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.320]   I'm gonna be in Luke chapter 18 if you wanna turn there.
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.000]   This was written as an eyewitness account
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.040]   of Jesus interacting with this young man
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.720]   known as the rich young ruler.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.960]   Here it is in Luke 18.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.680]   It also shows up in Mark chapter 10 and Matthew chapter 19.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.000]   The reason that's important
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.880]   is 'cause we move through this series AD
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.520]   looking at real interactions with Jesus.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.840]   You have four books to choose from.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.280]   The first four books of the New Testament,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.840]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.520]   These were men who ran with Jesus
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.200]   and they just documented about their life.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.520]   They just wrote down what they saw.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.020]   And so these three men, it shows up in three gospels,
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.020]   says, oh yeah, today we saw Jesus interacting
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.660]   with a rich young ruler.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.960]   Let me tell you about it.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.500]   Their stories will be slightly different
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.380]   because they're written from individual perspectives.
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.460]   And so we can cross-reference those stories.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.780]   But here in Luke 18, there's this rich young ruler.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.900]   That's what we know about him.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.180]   And so he's a young man, he's wealthy, and he's a ruler.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.700]   Not a religious ruler, but some sort of economic ruler.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.300]   He has an empire, some sort of business.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.340]   I like to think about him as Tim Tebow, okay?
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.620]   So if you know Tim, think of the rich young ruler as Tim Tebow.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.260]   Here's why I say that, is 'cause this man
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.300]   would have been known for his faith.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.240]   He would have been known for his devotion to God.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.540]   And I'm gonna tell you why in just a minute.
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.700]   But Jesus walks up on him and he says,
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.040]   Jesus, what must I do to get into heaven?
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.880]   This is the question that a lot of you
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.540]   came here tonight to answer.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.260]   What do I gotta do to get into heaven?
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.340]   I wanna get into heaven.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.700]   Jesus responds, be perfect, be good.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.940]   He responds in an outrageous way,
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.460]   saying, I am good, Jesus.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.380]   And so Jesus says, well, if you really wanna be good,
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.940]   sell everything you have, give it to the poor,
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.780]   and follow me, and he leaves sad because he has a lot.
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.240]   He can't go all in with Jesus.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.100]   And so we'll pick up Luke 18, verse 18.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:03.100]   A certain ruler asked him, good teacher,
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.660]   what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.580]   That word for good there is agathos.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.500]   It means intrinsically good.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.620]   So he's not saying, hey, you are a person who teaches well.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.820]   He's saying, you are a person who is good
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.620]   by nature and a teacher.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.880]   The good there is not referring to his teaching abilities,
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.300]   but referring to him as a person.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.880]   And so Jesus responds, why do you call me good?
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.020]   No one is good except God alone.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.780]   He's distinguishing that he is not acknowledging
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.040]   Jesus as God, he's saying, hey,
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.380]   if you're calling me God, you got it right,
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.020]   but if you're saying that man can be good,
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.100]   you got it wrong because man can't be good.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.600]   There's no one good except God alone.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.320]   Jesus is telegraphing where he is leading him
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.700]   in this narrative.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.220]   He's saying, oh, you think people can be good?
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.400]   You want eternal life?
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.340]   Well, then, you know the commandments.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.340]   You shall not commit adultery.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.900]   You shall not murder.
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.720]   You shall not steal.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.180]   You shall not give false testimony
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.780]   and honor your father and mother.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.240]   Jesus responds honestly.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.220]   Like you may read this thing,
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.860]   oh, Jesus is just jacking with him.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.700]   No, he's saying, hey, you wanna get into heaven?
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.540]   Be perfect.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.500]   He's answering his question.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.500]   What must I do?
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.340]   Here's what you must do.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.580]   If you came up to me and you said, hey,
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.740]   what must I do to get into heaven?
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.140]   I would say, you, the only thing you can do
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.040]   on your own to get into heaven is be perfect.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.880]   That's it.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.060]   That's all you can do on your own to get into heaven.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.140]   You'd have to be perfect.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.980]   That's the bar.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.300]   And so what should the guy respond?
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.260]   He should be like, well, Jesus,
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.820]   there's no way I could do that.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.500]   I mean, the 10 commandments,
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.340]   I've broken every single one of them.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.540]   I've lusted in my heart.
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.140]   I've wanted my neighbor's possessions.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.860]   I'm not honored God.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.900]   My thought life, I'm a broken sinner.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.120]   I can't do those things.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.980]   That's not what he says, though.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.860]   He says, all these I have kept since I was a boy.
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.300]   He says, I'm good.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.380]   I've done good things.
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.900]   You want heaven?
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.720]   Be good.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.560]   I am good.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.860]   That's your problem.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.160]   You think you're good.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.100]   And so Jesus is gonna go on to show him that he's not.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.860]   And so my first point this evening is self-reliance
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.420]   will keep you from going all in with Jesus.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.480]   This is so important tonight, so important in 2016,
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.360]   so important in an age of dependence,
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.040]   so important where you're going out, getting yours,
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.800]   where you have a drive, where you think,
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.600]   hey, I'm gonna be the king of my empire.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.680]   I'm gonna make it work.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.900]   Self-reliance will keep you from going all in.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:47.820]   Can you get to heaven by keeping all the commandments?
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.780]   Yes.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.440]   Can you keep all the commandments?
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.060]   No.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.840]   You sure cannot.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.460]   And so if you're here and you're playing religious games,
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.300]   you're gonna go through life managing your life,
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.060]   trying to control your life, trying to control God,
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.640]   managing your 80 years, you're gonna get to the end of it
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.000]   and you're gonna go to hell.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.820]   And you're gonna come to the gross realization
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.160]   that I'm not good.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.000]   I thought I was good.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.320]   I thought I could be good enough.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.720]   I had made a wager with God.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.860]   I viewed him, as Shane said earlier here in Dallas,
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.340]   I viewed him as an employer,
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.520]   not a loving father,
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.720]   not someone that wants good for me.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.260]   See, winning in this game starts by going all in
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.660]   with the right works.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.480]   I want you to think about that for a moment.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.760]   Winning here starts by going all in with the right works.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.880]   What are the right works?
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.200]   His works, not your works.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.520]   See, in this moment, this question that we ask
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.920]   so many people after the porch is,
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.720]   if you stood before God and he said to you,
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.080]   why should I let you in?
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.280]   What would you say?
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.800]   And so many people, over and over, they tell me,
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.680]   they say, because I (imitates buzzer)
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.560]   Well, because I'm good, because I believe,
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.160]   because I followed, because I was in church,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.720]   because I tried to do good things,
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.840]   because I (imitates buzzer)
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.120]   Those two words disqualifier.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.320]   Because I, no.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   No, not because of you anything.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.800]   All you did was screw this deal up.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.360]   Because Jesus, why should I let you into heaven?
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.260]   I don't think it's a real conversation that happens,
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.800]   but a hypothetical one that just gets us to think,
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.460]   why should I let you into heaven?
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.420]   Well, because I've got nothing, God.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.840]   I don't have anything to bring you.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.640]   I'm just, you know, in my flesh, left to my own devices.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.120]   I'm a wretched sinner.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.720]   But because of what you did, God,
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.900]   for me through your son, Jesus Christ,
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.560]   because you sent him to die for the sins
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.560]   that I've committed, because he got what I deserve,
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.040]   you promised that I could have what he deserves
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.680]   as a perfect heir to your kingdom.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   I got nothing.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.540]   See, good people go to hell,
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.640]   but people who realize their need for God
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.640]   receive his grace.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.440]   Said otherwise, the Bible says,
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.460]   no one is good except God.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.140]   I'll say that again if it's helpful.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.060]   Good people go to hell,
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.640]   but people who realize their need for God's grace
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.140]   receive his grace.
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.200]   The where this falls in Luke 18 is really important
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.620]   because there's two other stories before this
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.580]   that are exposing self-righteousness.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.700]   See, a lot of you have thought of the rich young ruler
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.900]   as kind of Cash McMogleson or this who's who,
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.180]   you know, just living it up in uptown.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.220]   This guy is a rule follower.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.340]   He's a religious guy.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.620]   He grew up in Sunday school.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.840]   And so right before this story, here's what happened.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.140]   Luke 18, verse 15.
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.340]   People were also bringing babies to Jesus
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.380]   for him to place his hands on them.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.320]   When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.380]   But Jesus called the children to him and said,
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.980]   let the little children come to me and do not hinder them
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.900]   for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.140]   Truly I tell you, anyone who will not, what?
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:08.260]   Anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.780]   like a little child will never enter it.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.800]   What must I do to inherit eternal life, good teacher?
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.720]   You must receive God's grace.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.800]   It's a gift to you.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.480]   He's giving it to you.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.940]   You must come to him like a child.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.900]   A child is high maintenance surrounded by noise.
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.540]   I mean, that's what a child is.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.220]   They've got nothing to offer God.
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.180]   They come, I mean, no, they're coming to Jesus.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.580]   Like what could that kid come to Jesus and say,
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.860]   hey, you want what my jacks or, you know, peppermint?
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.320]   What does he got to offer Jesus?
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.160]   Nothing.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.700]   Nothing.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.600]   High maintenance surrounded by noise.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.520]   And so you receive heaven like a gift.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.560]   Sometimes I'll share this with people and they'll say this,
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.380]   they'll say, well, I'm trying JP.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.660]   You're still missing it.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.080]   Like if I'm handing you a gift, if you're here
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.360]   and I'm saying here, here's the gift.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.580]   And I say here, try to take it.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.120]   What always happens, I'll do this and people will take it.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.800]   And I'll say, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't take it.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.100]   Try to take it.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.120]   Try to take this gift I'm giving you.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.320]   And they take it again.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.640]   I'm like, no, no, no, no, don't try to take it.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.000]   I mean, don't take it, try to take it.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.600]   And we get in this weird kind of awkward
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.760]   where they put their hands on the gift
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.600]   and they look at me and they're like,
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.880]   what are you trying to show me?
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.840]   Just kind of like you're looking at me right now.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.880]   And what I'm trying to show you is you can't try
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.640]   to take something that's being given you.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.260]   You can take it or you can reject it.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.280]   Those are your two options.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.560]   You can say, oh, thank you.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.920]   Or you can say, no, thank you.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.220]   But you can't try it.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.760]   It's being given to you right now as you sit there.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.460]   God's grace is freely extended to you to give you a verse.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.460]   For it is by grace, Ephesians 2, 8, 9.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.220]   For it is by grace you have been saved through faith.
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.020]   And this is not of yourself.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.540]   It is the gift of God, not by works,
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.780]   so that no one can boast in their own works.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.140]   It's the free gift of God.
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.340]   So what's the application here?
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.860]   Ask yourself, where in your life are you tempted
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.300]   to think you're good enough?
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.960]   Where are you in life,
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.340]   are you looking at others and you say,
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.360]   man, what's wrong with them?
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.200]   What's wrong with them?
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.460]   They don't have the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.860]   So they should sin.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.300]   That's their job description.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.020]   They should be wicked.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.900]   It is by God's common grace alone
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.500]   they are not more evil than they are.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.760]   But what about you who has the Holy Spirit?
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.980]   Where in your life are you tempted
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.340]   to think you're good enough?
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.220]   Verse 22.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.940]   When Jesus heard this, the man saying, I'm good,
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.780]   I've obeyed the commandments.
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.040]   When Jesus heard this, he said to them,
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.420]   well, you still lack one thing.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.420]   Sell everything you have and give it to the poor
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.760]   and you will have treasure in heaven.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.080]   Then come follow me.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.220]   How you hear Jesus' words here really matter.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.980]   'Cause for a long time, here's how I heard him.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.140]   This was the mental narrative in my head.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.700]   Oh, you think you're good, huh?
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.180]   Guys, come here, check this out.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.420]   I'm about to punk this dude, man.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.980]   He thinks he's good.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.020]   Oh, so you think, okay.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.360]   Okay, good.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.200]   Oh, awesome, hey, here's what I need you to do, bro.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.220]   I need you to sell everything, give it to the poor
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.060]   and then follow me.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.140]   Guys, watch this, watch this.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.940]   You see that look, he's sad.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.180]   You see that?
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.620]   Dude can't sell everything he has.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.040]   Thinks he's rich, chump, Tim Tebow.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:32.660]   But let me show you something in Mark chapter 10,
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.820]   same story.
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.180]   Teacher, he declared, all these things I have kept
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.400]   since I was a boy.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.800]   Verse 21, Jesus looked at him and loved him.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.680]   He has compassion on him and he says,
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.540]   hey, there's one thing that you lack.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.160]   Go sell everything you have and give it to the poor
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.080]   and you will have treasure in heaven
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.280]   and then come follow me.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.360]   What I have to do is I have to expose the idols
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.440]   in your heart that are preventing you from following me,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.760]   from going all in with me.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.720]   When the man heard this, verse 23, he became very sad
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.000]   because he was very wealthy, not just wealthy,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.520]   but a whole new category of wealthy.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.480]   He's very wealthy.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.200]   Jesus looked at him and said, how hard it is
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.120]   for the rich to enter the kingdom of God.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.400]   Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.020]   through the eye of a needle than for someone
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.280]   who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.680]   Maybe you've heard that that's talking about a camel
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.700]   has to get on his knees to enter through a gate
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.480]   in Jerusalem called the eye of the needle.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.540]   That is crazy.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.960]   There is no historical context to support
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.440]   that view whatsoever.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.240]   Jesus is speaking in hyperbole here.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.000]   He's saying it's impossible.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.020]   He's saying it would be easier to find a parking space
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.060]   at the porch than for this rich man to get into heaven.
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.660]   It would be easier, right?
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.340]   It would be easier and insert something crazy.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.300]   It's not gonna happen.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:03.300]   Verse 26, those who heard this asked,
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.800]   who then can be saved?
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.040]   Who then can be saved?
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.260]   Why would they ask that?
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.600]   Who then can be saved?
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.480]   Jesus, why would they ask that?
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.160]   It's very difficult to understand this text
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.140]   in American Christianity.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.740]   To fully understand this narrative,
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.880]   this interaction between Jesus and this man,
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.140]   we would have to understand the Jewish culture
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.900]   and context of which it is written.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.360]   Because in this context, this is very important,
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.460]   in the context of which this is written,
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.020]   everyone would have seen this man
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.060]   as one of the holiest people,
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.340]   most devout followers of God that they knew.
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.800]   Because he's wealthy, which would have been seen
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.900]   as a blessing by the Jewish people.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.560]   And he's a rule follower.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.500]   He's good, morally good.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.140]   At least he appears to be good, right?
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.900]   And so everybody's looking at this man
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.620]   and they're like, man, this man is the holiest man I know.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.460]   Jesus just told Tim Tebow he's not good enough
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.500]   to get into heaven.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.620]   And so they're asking, well, who then can?
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.300]   Let me say it like this so you understand what's going on.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.100]   It's like he says, hey, you wanna get into heaven?
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.460]   You gotta be fast.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:22.460]   And you say, okay, well, how fast do we have to be, Jesus?
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.340]   Hey, you know Usain Bolt?
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.620]   He ain't fast enough.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:32.020]   Well, who then can get into heaven, Jesus?
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.320]   That's what happened here.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.620]   You see this man?
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.540]   It's difficult for a rich man,
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.900]   which would have translated,
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.540]   it's difficult for a seminary graduate
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.120]   who really knows my word and spends lots of time
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.220]   doing religious things to get into heaven.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:52.020]   Who then, Jesus, can get in?
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.100]   Who has hope of getting in?
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.120]   And he says this incredible thing,
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.320]   in case you're here and you're very wealthy.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.820]   He replied, what is impossible with man
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.100]   is possible with God.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.900]   No one is good enough to get into heaven.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.200]   Good people go to hell, but God's people go to heaven.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.380]   God's people go to heaven.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.140]   My second point is the fear of losing what you have
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.540]   will keep you from going all in.
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.280]   That's what happened with this man here.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.260]   The fear of losing what you have
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.060]   will keep you from going all in with Jesus.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.100]   There's only one thing you lack.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.780]   Sell everything you have, give it to the poor,
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.380]   and follow me.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.620]   Why would Jesus respond this way?
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.820]   This seems like a crazy response to him.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.980]   Why didn't he just say, oh, you wanna get into heaven?
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.880]   Okay, pray that you're, okay, I'm a sinner.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.080]   Repeat after me, I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.980]   but I acknowledge that you came to forgive me of my sins.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.460]   Okay, why didn't he do that?
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.960]   That's what I would have done.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.940]   Because he's Jesus, and it's not uncommon
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.620]   for him to go after the idols of the heart.
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.140]   He does this all the time.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.220]   You remember the woman at the well?
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.100]   If you've been in church at all,
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.980]   then you've heard the story of the Samaritan woman
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.300]   at the well, Jesus comes up to her and talks to her,
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.900]   engages with her, loves her.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.900]   She's thirsty, and so he says, hey, you're thirsty?
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.700]   I can give you water that will make you never thirst again.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.060]   She says, where can I get this water?
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.820]   He says, well, go and get your husband.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.220]   She says, I have no husband.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.220]   He says, you're right when you say you have no husband,
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.340]   'cause you've had five husbands,
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.060]   and the man you're living with right now
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.180]   is not your husband.
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.580]   What's he doing?
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.780]   You say, you want eternal life?
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:36.640]   You got an idol of thirst,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.820]   and an idol of men and relationships,
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.420]   and you've been selling yourself
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.860]   to these five men over here, and they have your heart,
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.900]   and so right now, you're not in a position
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.620]   to give your heart to me,
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.140]   because you've been giving your heart to them,
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.640]   and he goes after their idols.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.780]   Tonight, as you sit there, as you listen,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.500]   what idols in your life is Jesus saying,
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.700]   hey, you're not experiencing the fullness of life
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.260]   that I have for you,
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.760]   because you're holding onto this thing over here,
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.040]   and you're missing out on the fullness of joy,
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.220]   the riches in relationship with me,
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.860]   because you're holding onto that.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.260]   What is it for you?
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:23.180]   He says, you want this?
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.340]   Let go of that.
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.020]   Jesus has something better than what you are holding onto.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.220]   In Mark chapter eight, verse 36, he says it like this.
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.500]   He says, what good is it for someone
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.660]   to gain the whole world, and yet forfeit their soul?
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.940]   And so I have this conversation all the time.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.080]   I'm not calling anyone out.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.580]   If you think I'm talking about you, I'm not.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.700]   I really, I have it every single Tuesday that I'm here.
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.900]   Someone will come up,
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.380]   and I'll share the gospel with them.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.460]   Did you know that God loves you so much, okay,
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.620]   and you've sinned against him?
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.540]   He sent his only son, Jesus Christ,
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.060]   as a sacrifice for your sins,
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.340]   and if you trust in that, his death and resurrection
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.780]   for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.020]   then you can enter into a relationship with God
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.040]   and be with him forever in his kingdom.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.880]   Do you wanna do that?
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.180]   Oh, man, I don't know, man.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.180]   Let me think on that.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.560]   What do you need to think on?
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.580]   I just not, you know, I just would have to change.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.940]   I mean, who's talking about change, man?
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.420]   I'm talking about you believing Jesus died for your sins
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.340]   and raised from the dead.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.700]   I just, man, I don't know, man,
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.640]   if I'm ready to give, you know, everything up.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.180]   What are you struggling to give up?
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.460]   And so you could insert your struggle here,
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.180]   whether it's money, whether it's work,
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.320]   whether it's, you know, alcohol, whether it's smoking,
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.220]   whether it's the party, drinking, whatever it is,
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.060]   insert yours.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.740]   I'll go with sex, okay?
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.300]   It's probably not relevant to most of you,
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.660]   but I'll just go with sex, and,
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.100]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.340]   except that guy, no, I'm just teasing.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.320]   I'm just teasing.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.180]   I'm just teasing.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.940]   I'm kidding.
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.740]   Sorry.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.060]   Where was I?
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.060]   I'm gonna go with sex, and,
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.300]   and,
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:05.580]   and I'm just, JP, man, I just, honestly, bro,
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.680]   I'm just not ready to walk away from sex.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.580]   Cool, man, let me ask you a ridiculous hypothetical question,
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.680]   and I just wanna disclaim it's ridiculous.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.900]   If I said, hey, if you have sex,
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.460]   he's male, we'll make him male.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.300]   If I say, if you have sex with your girlfriend one more time,
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.580]   you're gonna experience slow torture
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.020]   for the rest of your life, would you do it?
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.020]   Slow torture?
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.460]   I mean, no, I don't think so, man.
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.240]   Torture, crazy, what?
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.980]   Okay, well, let me go here.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.980]   If I said, hey, if you can abstain
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.820]   from having sex with your girlfriend,
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.640]   I'd give you a billion dollars,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.420]   and not only that, but riches forever,
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.860]   and pleasure greater than any orgasm you've ever had,
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.700]   could you abstain?
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.840]   Tell me more about this pleasure.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.640]   No. (audience laughing)
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.600]   Yeah, yeah, I think I could, yeah, yeah, I could do that.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.480]   Okay, cool, the reason I ask you
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.100]   those two ridiculous questions
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.160]   is because you have a belief problem,
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.120]   not a behavior problem.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.620]   See, you don't see how costly your sin
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.240]   is against the holy God,
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.540]   and you don't believe how good Christ is,
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.300]   the goodness that he is freely offering you right now.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.360]   You are holding onto something.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.200]   Now, let me say this disclaimer
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.160]   because you gotta hear this.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.440]   Torture, okay, and a billion dollars
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.240]   are terrible examples,
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.680]   do not accurately describe the horrors of hell
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.640]   or the glories of heaven, okay?
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.520]   And sex, in and of itself,
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.620]   isn't going to keep anyone out of heaven,
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.060]   but the belief that sex is better than Jesus will,
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:03.920]   the belief that you holding onto whatever it is
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.240]   that you can't let go of so you can follow Jesus will,
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.440]   when he's saying, hey, don't you understand,
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.720]   I've died for that,
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.400]   and it went in the grave and I came out without it.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.580]   Now, the last thing that I wanna do
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.760]   is put some guilt on you right now
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.620]   that would drive you to hibernation,
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.840]   that would drive you to a place
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.760]   where you feel so much shame that you can't talk about it.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:30.080]   I had sex before I was married a lot.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.980]   I was not a Christian, I was not following Christ.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.800]   I've received his grace and I've been made a new creation,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.320]   and you can too, but it starts with saying,
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   God, I repent, I turn from that,
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.480]   I want to confess, I wanna bring others in,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   I need help 'cause I'm addicted to her or him
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.400]   or them or whatever, I need help.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.740]   And Jesus, I wanna follow you,
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.880]   and I'll leave that behind me 'cause I know you're better.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.400]   I know you're so much better.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.740]   (sniffling)
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:11.220]   Following Jesus, write this down if you can,
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.140]   following Jesus will cost you something,
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.500]   but not following Jesus will cost you everything.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:25.020]   And so for this man here, it was his wealth.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:30.300]   He couldn't part from the idol of riches.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.120]   I've heard it said, what you can't give away,
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.320]   you don't own, it owns you.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.020]   I think that's so true for this text right here,
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.480]   that he's holding onto something and it's holding him back.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.280]   If right now, if tonight as you're listening,
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.360]   you're holding onto something that's holding you back
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.800]   from going all in with Jesus,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.760]   I have to love you enough to say
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.240]   that is unbelievably foolish.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.280]   If you are holding onto something
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.200]   that is holding you back from going all in with Jesus,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.520]   that is stupid, it is not wise, it is not smart,
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.980]   it is foolish.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:07.680]   I have seen this YouTube video one too many times,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.920]   way too many times, I'll just say,
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.920]   and it's silly and it's about how to capture a baboon.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.760]   And so I don't know if you're ever gonna be in a situation
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.300]   where you gotta capture a baboon,
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.300]   but tonight you're gonna learn how, okay?
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.440]   So anybody wanna learn how to capture a baboon?
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.840]   Good, okay.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.960]   Here's how you do it and it just shows this guy in Africa
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.260]   who evidently needs to capture this baboon
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.640]   and so what he does is he takes this termite mound
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.280]   or this ant mound and he drills a little hole in it
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.280]   with a stick and he takes some trinket or treasure
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.820]   or a seed in this case and he puts it in there
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.000]   and the baboon watches them,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.740]   they're evidently very curious animals.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.160]   And when the man walks away, the baboon comes to this
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.960]   and the comedy ensues as the baboon sticks his hand
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.960]   in the hole, grips whatever is in there
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.560]   and doesn't let it go and can't get his hand
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.120]   out of the hole and he just goes crazy.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.720]   I mean, the thing just goes crazy.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.040]   He's flipping upside down and with all his might,
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.120]   he's just trying to jerk his arm out of this hole
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.200]   and if he just let go, he'd be fine.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.640]   But what's about to happen is the dude's about to walk up
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.240]   and put a bullet in his head.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.900]   And as I think about the enemy that will put something
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.600]   in front of you and it'll tempt you and say,
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.160]   this is better than Jesus.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.520]   This is better than, this is, that relationship's better.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.720]   That money, that job, that girl, that guy,
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.320]   that sin, that porn, that material, whatever it is,
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:43.440]   it's better than Christ and he's just trying to kill you.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.040]   And I'm pleading with you tonight to let go of it.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.160]   To let go of it.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.400]   (clicking)
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:05.120]   So the application is, what are you holding onto
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.180]   that's holding you back right now?
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.040]   This is a great question to ask those
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.360]   that you're in community with, those that you're doing.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.060]   My prayer is for any Christian in the room
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.680]   that you would have other people you're meeting with
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.280]   on a weekly basis and asking questions like this.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.080]   I would email them before you leave the parking lot
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.920]   and I would just say, hey guys, help me see
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.480]   what's holding me back from going all in with Christ.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.760]   I asked my community this week just 'cause I knew
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.000]   I was teaching on it and Luke 18's just been messing with me
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.040]   and one of the guys just loved me enough to say,
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.760]   you know, when I came to your, you did that,
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.040]   remember when you had that garage sale?
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.440]   I was like, I remember, and they was like, man,
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.080]   you just had so much stuff you were getting rid of
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.140]   that was the latest and greatest thing of that day.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.360]   And it just seems like sometimes, JP,
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.440]   when you're not abiding with Jesus,
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.720]   you're trying to fill a void in your heart
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.600]   with iPhones and iPads and Apple TVs and Rokus
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.520]   and electronics and trinkets and treasures,
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.540]   Apple Watches and so forth and so on.
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:16.300]   Wasn't fun to hear, but I'm grateful for it.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.620]   Verse 28, Peter said to him,
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:30.060]   Jesus, this is right after, who can have eternal life?
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.100]   I mean, who gets in?
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.980]   Like, if that dude ain't getting in, who gets in?
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.180]   Well, with God, it's possible.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.940]   Well, we, you know, we've done what you asked him to do.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.220]   We left everything to follow you.
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.300]   Verse 29, truly I tell you, Jesus said to them,
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.360]   no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.900]   or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.740]   will fail to receive many times as much in this age
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.480]   and in the age to come eternal life.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:04.880]   Anyone who has followed me will inherit eternal life
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.420]   and not just eternal life,
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.140]   but whatever cost they paid to follow me
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:13.360]   is coming back to them in full in this age
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.700]   and/or in the age to come, certainly in the age to come.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:21.340]   Certainly in the age to come.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:27.020]   It's like, Peter, you haven't left anything.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.980]   You're slowly walking to more than you could ever imagine.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.460]   That's my third and final point,
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.140]   is not realizing what you will gain
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.800]   will keep you from going all in.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.780]   Not realizing what you will gain
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.660]   will keep you from going all in.
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.900]   Peter's like, we left everything.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.000]   Jesus is like, you haven't left anything.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.060]   Everything you've left, you're walking toward,
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.740]   and you will be able to enjoy it forever and ever and ever.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.400]   Every single good deed you do in my name
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.560]   will store up for you in some way that I can't even fathom,
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.180]   riches for you forever and ever and ever
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.140]   in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:06.540]   And so if you're here and you don't have Jesus,
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.160]   this is as good as it will ever get.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.740]   Enjoy your rich, young ruler-ness.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.620]   It's all you got.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.060]   But if you're here and you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.380]   this is as bad as it will ever be.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.780]   It's only up and to the right from this moment right now.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.340]   You are walking to eternal glory forever and ever and ever.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.600]   And so said otherwise, right?
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.820]   Not realizing what you will gain
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.080]   will keep you from going all in.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.820]   Not realizing who Jesus is will keep you from going all in,
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.140]   because he's the one with all the stuff.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.900]   Jesus is the real rich, young ruler of this text.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.340]   The cattle on a thousand hills belong to him.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.580]   It's his kingdom.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:48.420]   Every single thing that this guy has in his possession,
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.580]   if it's good, it was given to him
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:54.980]   by the father of heavenly lights from above, James tells us.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.340]   There is not a single thing that he owns
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.180]   that Jesus is not dominant over,
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.480]   does not have dominion over,
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.980]   is not king of, is not his.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.100]   He's so foolish in this exchange.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.620]   He's talking to the one with all the stuff.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.380]   Who's saying, "Hey, follow me."
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.980]   And he says, "I can't."
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:25.720]   Everybody here, I hope, for the sake of this illustration,
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.860]   has experienced like missing out,
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.660]   or at least you've seen somebody else
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.320]   really miss out on something.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.040]   The story that comes to mind for me is,
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.860]   I was going on an international discipleship trip
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.840]   early in my faith, and I was going with some guys,
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.780]   and one of the guys just said,
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.780]   "Hey, I'm going to go on a safari."
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.420]   We were going to Africa.
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.640]   He goes, "I'm gonna go on a safari
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.760]   "on the tail end of this trip.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.260]   "Would anyone like to go with me?"
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.060]   And nobody really moved or said anything.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.760]   He goes, he said, "I'll pay for it," to which I said,
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.600]   "I'll go."
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.840]   And I didn't know anything.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.040]   I'd never been to Africa, and I didn't know,
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.400]   and this was before we didn't do things like this.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.440]   And so I was like, "Man, I'm in."
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.780]   And so we go, and we taught in Africa,
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.120]   and we shared the gospel,
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.800]   and we had an amazing trip, discipleship trip,
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.420]   and then the time came for everybody else to go home,
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.920]   and he and I went on this safari,
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.120]   and as we're flying there, rather,
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.240]   to another country in Africa, I'm just asking him,
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.520]   I'm like, "Hey, where are we gonna stay?"
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.200]   And he's like, "You're gonna stay in tents."
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.480]   And I'm picturing REI pop-up tents.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.800]   I'm like, "Are the tigers gonna get us?"
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.440]   Yeah, I don't, or the lions, rather, in Africa.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.520]   "Are the lions gonna get us?
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.480]   "Like, what is this gonna be like?"
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.640]   I'm like, "Where are we gonna shower?"
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.560]   And he's like, "Ah, you know,
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.960]   "you'll see when you get there."
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.620]   I just, guys, I just didn't know, man.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.840]   I was, I didn't know.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.640]   I mean, poor boy from Puerto Texas, man, I didn't know.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.000]   It was, blow your mind, unbelievable.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.520]   Okay, we get on this little puddle jumper plane
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.160]   that takes us to this area of Kenya,
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.560]   the Maasai Mara, the plane lands on this dirt runway.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.840]   This guy comes in a Defender 90 to pick us up.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.600]   That's like a truck that you can drive
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.720]   in the African jungle, and he picks us up,
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.000]   our luggage, and he drives, and I mean,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.320]   you're just driving through the jungle.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.720]   There's nothing, there's nothing
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.760]   but incredible animals everywhere,
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.400]   with no fence, just in the wild,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.460]   and he pulls up to this canopy,
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.520]   and there's this guard, I mean,
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.640]   just like this thick tree bush kind of thing,
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.080]   and there's this guard standing there,
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.840]   and he drives in through this tunnel,
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.280]   and we keep driving down this road,
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.720]   and we get to the nicest kind of four seasons,
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.720]   Ritz Carlton place I've ever imagined,
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.120]   and there's this infinity swimming pool right in the,
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.400]   I had no idea, like, I thought we were staying in tents,
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.520]   and so, and like, I'm swimming in the swimming pool,
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.680]   and this baboon comes up,
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.480]   and he's like drinking water right beside me,
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.520]   and there's people bringing you hot towels
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.140]   and spraying you with water if you're hot,
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.660]   and I mean, you're just like, what?
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:01.940]   I've never even seen like this,
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.660]   and we're walking down this path,
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:06.140]   and I trip over a warthog, and I go to my tent,
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.900]   and true story, and I go into my tent.
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.480]   Well, it's not a tent, it's like a tent
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.460]   with a slate foundation, and it's as big as this stage,
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.600]   and there's this huge walk-in glass shower in the back,
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.620]   and this California king-size bed right in the middle,
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.900]   and just all of these luxurious amenities,
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.340]   and through the day, like, we went,
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.380]   and we saw the lions, and the leopards,
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.940]   and the big five, and at night,
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.280]   we just retired to this unbelievable place
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.280]   and ate food better than I've ever had,
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.740]   and to this day, and I hate saying this,
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:36.900]   'cause my wife went with me,
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.760]   but by far the best vacation I've ever been on.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.540]   And I'm laying in my bed.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:49.780]   All I could think of is those guys missed out.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.580]   What were they thinking?
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.820]   They didn't know.
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.300]   They didn't know.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.140]   I didn't know.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.100]   If they would've known,
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:07.000]   they wouldn't have missed out.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.340]   If you're here and you're not in a relationship with Christ,
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.300]   that's what I wanna tell you.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.400]   Man, if you just knew.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.940]   Look, whatever you think you're holding onto,
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.940]   in case we don't know each other,
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.040]   I lived in the world.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:26.420]   Drugs, sex, money, penthouse condo in uptown, Jaguar,
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.460]   S-type, I mean, cars, watches, suits, the whole deal.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.620]   I pursued the world as hard as I could,
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.940]   and God saved me from it.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.020]   And what I have today is so much better than that,
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.980]   and I'm not drunk, I'm not high, I'm not naive,
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.220]   I'm not foolish.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.860]   I'm just shooting you straight.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:52.180]   That what Christ has to offer you is better.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:02.400]   So, the application here is to give sacrificially.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.020]   Give away more than you're comfortable with.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.300]   That's what Jesus did.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.060]   Like, if you're here and you're like, well, I tithe,
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.380]   that's cool, you've got to the Old Testament command.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.420]   The New Testament command is to give until you feel it,
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.460]   to give sacrificially.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.600]   Jesus didn't tithe his blood on the cross.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.580]   And I'm not, if you're like,
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.620]   oh, you're gonna take up an offering, no, I'm not.
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.780]   I'm not taking up an offering.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.060]   I'm telling you to be generous
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.260]   with what God has entrusted to you.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.280]   Wherever you're at, whatever church you go to,
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.820]   whatever ministries you're involved with,
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.920]   whoever God places in your path,
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.000]   give more than you're comfortable with.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.260]   Because on the cross, Jesus didn't tithe his blood,
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.100]   he didn't give 10% of his blood.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.100]   What he modeled for us is he did
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.100]   what he's asking this man to do.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.220]   Jesus was the perfect rich young ruler.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.020]   He obeyed all the commandments
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:57.020]   and then he gave all that he had to the poor, that's us,
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.460]   so that we might inherit eternal life.
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.140]   And that's the gospel and that's all we got
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.380]   and that's the only way that we're getting in.
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.640]   And so in summary, go all in by relying fully
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.420]   on the finished work of Jesus.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:17.100]   Go all in by letting go of what is holding you back.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.860]   And go all in by knowing that the benefit
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:23.820]   far outweighs the cost.
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:33.620]   Recently, Shane E and I took our families to the beach
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.420]   and it was a great time.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:39.580]   And we're sitting there on the side,
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.580]   watching our kids play and what happens is
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.580]   I've got a nine year old and a seven year old
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.480]   and he has a couple daughters as well
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.260]   and they're playing together
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.060]   and this sand castle contest ensues, okay?
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.180]   That's just what happens when you're on the beach.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.020]   And so they're like,
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.460]   "I can build a better sand castle than you."
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:44:00.180]   And so they start piling sand on top of sand
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.820]   and kind of digging this poor ditch of a moat,
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.860]   they're calling a moat and they are having a blast.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.980]   I'm watching, it's fun just to delight in your children
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.580]   and just they're having so much fun
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.700]   and they're dancing around
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.820]   and prancing around these sand castles
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.340]   and they're like, "I'm a princess, you're a princess,
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.400]   "you're a queen, okay, who's gonna be the king?"
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.840]   And they're just having,
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.360]   they're all royalty all of a sudden
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.800]   and they've got these three sand castles
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.660]   and because it's a contest,
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.480]   they begin to measure them and they don't have a ruler
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.300]   and so one of them learned like this was an inch
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.880]   and so they all stack their fingers like this
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.280]   next to the sand castle
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.240]   trying to figure out whose is the tallest
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.640]   and whatever sand castle you're picturing in your mind,
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.400]   let me just tell you, this looked like a sad anthill, okay?
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.680]   Like not a castle at all, but just a pile of dirt
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:48.220]   and they're having fun as royalty
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.080]   and just imagine with me for a moment
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.320]   if a king walked up
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:02.080]   and he said, "You wanna be a princess?
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:05.300]   "Do you wanna be a queen?
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:08.240]   "You wanna be royalty?
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.280]   "Well, it just turns out that I have a kingdom.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.360]   "I own a couple castles."
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:18.040]   "Come with me and everything I have is yours."
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:25.160]   And imagine with me for a moment
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.200]   if they looked at him and they might actually do this
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.200]   and they said, "What?
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:34.700]   "Sir, do you not see we have castles?"
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:39.720]   I mean, I don't know if you noticed,
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.800]   but we constructed some pretty incredible castles
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.960]   right here at our feet.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.200]   We have no need to follow you.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.180]   We have a kingdom.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:57.480]   And you're right to laugh at a seven-year-old,
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.520]   but the problem is that's the narrative
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.760]   of some 30-year-olds, some 22-year-olds,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.140]   some 20-year-olds looking at Jesus saying,
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.840]   "What, oh, you got a kingdom, huh?
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.240]   "So do I."
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:20.860]   And the tide of the return of Christ
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.000]   is gonna come and wash your little sandcastle away,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   your white picket fence and house and German shepherd
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.160]   and that husband you hope to have
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.040]   or wife you or kids or whatever,
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:34.680]   it's gonna, the tide of the return of Jesus
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.560]   is gonna wash that away
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.760]   and you're gonna be left with holding
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.680]   what you thought was of value
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.480]   when he's offering you eternal riches.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:49.600]   When you're the king and queens of sandcastles.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.880]   And you're looking at the king of the universe.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:01.160]   I say, "No, I'm good.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.920]   "Don't do that.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.840]   "Please don't do that."
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.560]   The grace that he offers you is completely free.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.840]   You may give something up following Christ,
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.520]   you may face some persecution.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.960]   It may get hard.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.560]   In this world, you might have trouble,
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.660]   you will have trouble,
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:27.040]   but take heart, he's overcome the world
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.860]   to not follow Christ who cost you everything.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.040]   Some of you, as I said, have too much of the world
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:42.200]   to enjoy Jesus and too much Jesus to enjoy the world.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.880]   And he's asking you to go all in.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.560]   I'm going to pray that you would.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.560]   Father,
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:58.560]   consume our hearts as we sing this song to you.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.640]   Overwhelm us with your love and your grace
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.680]   and your mercy so that we look at what we have
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.120]   as trinkets and treasures not missing out
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.840]   on the trip of a lifetime.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.440]   That we would follow you.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.840]   That we would bring our gifts to the altar
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:25.520]   of an almighty God and that nothing would hold us back.
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:32.280]   That we would tell the world of your treasures.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.280]   And tell the world that their treasures are sandcastles.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:43.160]   Would you do that in our hearts now?
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:53.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
