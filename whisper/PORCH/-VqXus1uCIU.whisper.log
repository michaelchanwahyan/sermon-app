[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.600]   What's up, Porch? How we doing tonight?
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.880]   Hey, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.300]   Let me introduce myself to you.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.200]   My name is Timothy Atik, and I am
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200]   one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.600]   And I'm so fired up to be with you here
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.000]   at the first Porch of 2023.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.040]   I know we've got a bunch of people right here
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.400]   in the room here in Dallas, but we've got people
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.360]   watching all over the nation.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.040]   So just a quick shout out to those in Boise, Indianapolis,
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.880]   Greater Lafayette, Austin, Midland, Tulsa, Scottsdale,
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.400]   Cincinnati, Fort Worth, and Des Moines.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.040]   We're so glad that you are tuning in.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.040]   Tonight, we're starting a new series,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.600]   and here's what it's called.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.520]   It's called The Return--
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.680]   Living Like Jesus is Coming Back.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.440]   Here's what prompted the series.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.400]   I was at dinner with some friends
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.880]   who were just sharing what God was doing in their lives.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.840]   And as I processed what they were saying,
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.320]   this thought popped into my mind, and here it is.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.360]   I want you to just imagine this.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.960]   If Jesus Christ were to walk through those doors right
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.560]   there, if he were to walk in here--
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.120]   we're going to hand him the microphone because he's Jesus.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.080]   Like, I don't need the microphone anymore.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.440]   Jesus is here.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.520]   We'll just give it to him.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.560]   But if Jesus were to walk through those doors
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.560]   and we were to give him a microphone,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.360]   what would happen if Jesus walked in and said,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.920]   hey, guys, mark the calendars.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.520]   One year from today, January 24, 2024, I am coming back.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.000]   Mark your calendars.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.080]   Start a timer.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.760]   Start a countdown.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.640]   If Jesus were to walk in and say, I am letting you know.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.000]   The Bible says that no one knows the day or time,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   but now you do.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.240]   One year from today, I am coming back.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.400]   What would change?
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.600]   Would anything change?
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.640]   Just think about that.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.960]   If you knew with concrete certainty
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.520]   that one year from today, Jesus is coming back,
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.680]   what would you start doing?
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.600]   What would you stop doing?
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.840]   What would instantaneously become of greatest importance
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.320]   to you?
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.720]   Is there anything that you're doing now
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.280]   which would just become inconsequential
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.000]   and you would easily get rid of it?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.120]   When I was growing up, I grew up in a Christian household.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.560]   And so there were different times when I was at church
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.360]   and they would talk about Jesus coming back.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.160]   And then my brother and I, we would watch these movies
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.920]   about Jesus coming back.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.440]   And people would just disappear.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.480]   And then their clothes would just be left in their chairs.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.520]   It was pretty freaky.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.840]   I mean, it freaked me out as a kid.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.720]   But when I thought about Jesus coming back,
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.840]   there were different moments throughout my life
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.920]   where I began to think, you know what?
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.160]   I hope that I get to fill in the blank
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.480]   before Jesus comes back.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.880]   So when I was younger, it was like, you know what?
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.960]   I really hope I get to go on the ski trip
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.960]   before Jesus comes back.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.800]   And then when I got some hormones, I was like,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.760]   I really hope I'm able to have sex before Jesus comes back.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.600]   That's just full disclosure.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.000]   Some of y'all have had that thought too,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.400]   but that's just the reality.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.640]   Like, I remember there was one time
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.280]   that I was in the middle of sin and I was like,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.560]   I hope Jesus doesn't come back right now.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.800]   I don't know if you've ever dealt with that.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.960]   And even as I got into my mid-twenties,
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.920]   it's like, I hope that I'm able to do something
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.480]   with my life before Jesus comes back.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.600]   Do you have anything like that?
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   Like, maybe you'd position it as,
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.000]   you hope to get to do something,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.600]   you hope to accomplish something before you die.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.400]   When I think back of those different thoughts
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.560]   of hoping that I would get to experience something
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.360]   before Jesus came back,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.360]   what I realized is that all I wanted was,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.320]   I was looking at what was right in front of me
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.600]   and all I wanted was the immediate satisfaction
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.240]   of whatever that pleasure was.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.680]   But I'm talking about something much deeper here.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.040]   I'm talking about something much greater.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.960]   Like, if we had the clarity
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.560]   that Jesus was gonna come back January 24th, 2024,
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.040]   what would change? What would you start?
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.960]   What would you stop?
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.040]   Like, it is my belief that radical change
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.560]   would happen across this room.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.080]   Like, I would imagine that there would be certain people
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.120]   in this room that you've had one foot in
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.400]   and one foot out with Jesus,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.440]   and you would finally say, "I'm all in."
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.840]   Like, you would finally fully surrender to Jesus.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.880]   Jesus wouldn't just be a part of your life,
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.160]   He would be the passion of your life.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   I would imagine that there would be certain people
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.000]   that'd say, "You know what?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.920]   "I'm finally gonna start treasuring His Word.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.080]   "I'm finally gonna start meeting with God each day
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.800]   "and talking to Him and praying with Him.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.640]   "I'm finally gonna deal with that sin.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.400]   "I'm finally gonna share my faith with that person at work
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.640]   "that I've been too nervous to share with
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.480]   "because I don't wanna jeopardize the relationship."
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.920]   I think that there would be radical change across this room.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.760]   Now, here's the reality.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.640]   We don't know when Jesus is coming back.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.800]   We don't. But I'll just say this.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.120]   When I think about my time here on earth,
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.440]   and here's the deal, I'm a huge Cowboys fan.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.120]   I am, I'm a huge Cowboys fan.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.520]   And if you're a Cowboys fan, let's be honest.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.400]   We wish that we had the last two minutes and 20 seconds
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.560]   back from that game, right?
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.040]   Like, even just the last play,
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.360]   if we could just run it again.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.680]   Like, when that pass happened and that tackle happened,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.800]   it's like, wait, that's it?
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.760]   Like, that was it.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.880]   Like, I don't wanna get to the end of my life
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.560]   where if Jesus comes back, I don't wanna be like,
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.840]   "Man, if I could only just have the last two minutes
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.640]   "and 20 seconds or the last two months and 20 days back."
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.520]   Like, I don't wanna carry any regret.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.360]   But here's the thing.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.280]   We don't know when Jesus is coming back.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.320]   We just don't know.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.120]   But if when you hear that question,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.240]   if you hear, what if Jesus walked into the room
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.080]   and said he's coming back one year from today?
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.400]   If something in you begins to resonate
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.280]   and you get clarity really quickly,
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.160]   I would definitely start doing that.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.400]   I would most certainly stop doing that.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.880]   You know what?
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.240]   You're getting the luxury right now
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.720]   of realizing what is of greatest importance to you.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.440]   Like, we don't have the luxury of knowing
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.800]   when Jesus is coming back,
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.720]   but you are now experiencing the luxury
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.520]   of knowing what matters most.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.840]   Activate on it.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.520]   Don't just sit there and do nothing with it.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   So here's my hope.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.160]   My hope is that the young adults of Dallas
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.160]   would be a people that live like Jesus is coming back.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.440]   What I wanna do tonight is I wanna look into the scriptures,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.680]   the Holy Bible, and I wanna look at a guy
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.280]   who lived like Jesus was coming back.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.520]   He was a guy who lived with great clarity
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.600]   and great urgency.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.880]   It's a guy named John,
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.840]   and John wrote five different books in the Bible,
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.040]   and the one that we're gonna look at
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   is the last book of the entire Bible.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.880]   It's a book called Revelation.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.760]   If you've ever tried to read Revelation,
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.400]   it's a difficult book to read, so bold move.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.880]   Out of the gate, first night of the spring,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.160]   we're going to Revelation 1.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.600]   So if you have a Bible, turn with me tonight
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.440]   to Revelation chapter 1.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.640]   We're looking at a guy named John.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.440]   John wrote Revelation.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.880]   John's a pretty important figure in the Bible.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.560]   If you don't know anything about the Bible,
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   Jesus had 12 people that he spent a lot of time with,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.320]   known as the 12 disciples,
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.520]   and then out of those 12,
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.160]   there were three people that he spent even more time with.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.720]   John was one of them.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.240]   John and his brother, Jesus called them sons of thunder.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.640]   That's a pretty baller nickname.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.400]   Like when Jesus gives you a nickname,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.840]   you know that you guys are tight.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.820]   He's one of the sons of thunder.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.320]   John was the guy that at Jesus's last meal,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.680]   you see John like laying on Jesus's chest.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.020]   John is the guy when Jesus is hanging on the cross,
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.120]   Jesus looks down and entrusts his mother
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.600]   to the care of John.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.160]   John was the one that when he wrote his gospel,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.960]   he referred to himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved,
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.200]   which I kind of find weird, but that's what he did.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:22.040]   And then John got exiled to an island called Patmos
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.160]   for preaching the word of God.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.560]   And when he was on that island, he got a vision,
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.420]   and that vision is known as the book of Revelation.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.400]   So that's what we're stepping into.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   And John was a guy who lived like Jesus was coming back.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.880]   And as we look at his life,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.000]   you know what we're going to see here?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.940]   When we look at what he says in Revelation chapter one,
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.600]   we're gonna see that if you wanna live
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.960]   like Jesus is coming back, you need to do,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.400]   you need to have three things.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.240]   Number one, you need to have the right perspective.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.540]   You need to live with the right perspective.
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.180]   Number two, you need to live with the right person.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.800]   And number three, you need to live with the right posture.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.400]   Usually not a big alliteration guy,
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.560]   but I'm just gonna lean into it tonight, all right?
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.700]   If you wanna live like Jesus is coming back,
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.960]   then you wanna live with the right perspective,
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.640]   you wanna live with the right person,
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.660]   and then you wanna live with the right posture.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.680]   Revelation chapter one, look at verse one.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.740]   It just kind of gives us some information that's helpful.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.200]   It says the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.680]   That word revelation,
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.640]   in the original language of the New Testament,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.640]   it's a Greek word, apokalipsis,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.120]   which is where we get our word apocalypse.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.320]   It literally means unveiling.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.920]   So this book that we're looking at
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.640]   is an unveiling of something.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.320]   It is meant to reveal something to us,
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.240]   which is surprising if you've ever tried to read Revelation.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.400]   It feels like it's trying to conceal
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   more than it's attempting to reveal
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   because it's kind of hard to understand.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   But it says that this is the revelation
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   or the unveiling of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.600]   So here's what that means.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.440]   It means that the book of Revelation
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.320]   reveals the person of Jesus Christ to us
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.400]   in a way that no other book of the Bible does.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.000]   And it reveals what Jesus wants us to know
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.700]   in a very important way.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.400]   The revelation of Jesus Christ,
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.760]   which God gave him to show his servants
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.200]   the things that must soon take place.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.800]   He made it known by sending his angel to his servant, John.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.600]   So this is John writing.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.040]   And if you look at verses two through eight,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.360]   what John is doing is he's just kind of giving a welcome.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.720]   He's giving an introduction.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.160]   And he says something in verse seven,
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.360]   which is really important.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.380]   And it speaks to the first thing that we need
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.440]   if we're going to live like Jesus is coming back.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.200]   It speaks to having the right perspective.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.000]   Look at what it says in verse seven.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.680]   John says, "Behold, he is coming with the clouds.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.600]   "In every eye will see him.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.120]   "Even those who pierced him in all tribes of the earth
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.780]   "will wail on account of him.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.360]   "Even so, amen."
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.560]   So if you want to live like Jesus is coming back,
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.640]   I want to encourage you to live with the right perspective.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.880]   What is the right perspective?
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.720]   It's the perspective that Jesus is coming back.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.680]   It's not that he might come back.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.640]   It's not that it's a possibility or a probability.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.560]   It is that there is certainty Jesus one day,
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.600]   someday is with certainty he is coming back.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.920]   So we want to be people who live with that perspective.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.640]   Look at what John says.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.440]   Let's just break down verse seven.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.520]   He says, "Behold," that's a term of sight.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.080]   He's saying, "See, open up your eyes.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.840]   "Open up the eyes of your heart.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.360]   "See, don't be blind to reality.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.360]   "Behold, he, Jesus, is coming with the clouds."
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.360]   He's saying Jesus Christ will come back to earth.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.660]   And watch this, he says, "And every eye will see him."
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.000]   Every eye will see him.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.960]   My eyes will see him.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.240]   Your eyes will see Jesus.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.480]   Every eye will see him.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.740]   What John is saying here is Jesus' return
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.480]   will be a universal return.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.360]   It will have universal consequences.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.800]   It will be that wide of an impact.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.320]   To say that every eye will see him
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   means that there is not one person
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.880]   who will be too busy with work
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.080]   to look up from their computer to see Jesus.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.920]   No one will be too busy with their money
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.240]   or with sex or pleasure or anything else.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.640]   No one will miss seeing Jesus.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.960]   Every eye will see Jesus.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.400]   It says, "Every eye will see him,
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.560]   "even those who pierced him."
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.920]   And watch this, "All tribes of the earth
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.900]   "will wail on account of him."
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.000]   That's pretty interesting.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.560]   It says all the tribes of the earth.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.640]   That's another way of just repeating
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.960]   that his return will have a universal impact.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.920]   And it says that all the tribes will wail on account of him.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.000]   Do you know what that's saying?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.440]   All it's simply saying is that
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.200]   no one will be indifferent to Jesus.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.560]   When Jesus comes back and you see him,
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.440]   it will be the most intense moment of emotion
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.960]   that you have experienced to date.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.080]   It will be the most intense and extreme emotion
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.920]   that you have experienced to date.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.840]   More emotion than Justin Bieber is experienced today
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.680]   selling his music catalog for $200 million.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.440]   More emotion than you experienced
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.920]   or greater than the high you experienced
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.440]   at that New Year's Eve party or any relationship,
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.120]   any sexual high, getting your bonus at the end of the year,
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.040]   going on that vacation,
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.840]   looking at the balance of your 401k.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.760]   There is nothing, there's no emotional high or low
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.560]   that you will experience that is more intense or extreme
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.920]   than the emotion you will experience
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.920]   when you see Jesus Christ.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.640]   You can kiss indifference goodbye when Jesus Christ shows up.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.920]   You will be at one extreme end of the spectrum.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.960]   It will either be your greatest moment of joy
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.760]   or your greatest moment of regret.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.360]   Because in that moment,
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.360]   Jesus will be revealed as the point of everything.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.240]   Again, that moment, every person on the planet
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.240]   will have crystal clarity
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.080]   that everything has been about Jesus.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.800]   All of creation has been pointing to Jesus.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.520]   You exist for Jesus,
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.640]   to know Jesus.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.560]   And so there will either be,
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.040]   and I hope you don't miss what I'm saying,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.800]   there will either be joy,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.320]   there will either be overwhelming joy
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.600]   in seeing the one you have been expecting
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.320]   or there will be overwhelming regret
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.560]   in seeing the one you have been rejecting.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.880]   No one will be in between.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.720]   No one.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.640]   No one will be in between.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.040]   So here's my encouragement to you.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.800]   If that is true, to live with the right perspective
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.440]   is to live with the understanding
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.640]   Jesus is coming back.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.600]   So here's my encouragement.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   Don't wait until you see Jesus to finally see Jesus.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.840]   Okay, do you hear what I'm saying?
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.480]   Like, if every eye will see him,
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.360]   including yours, including mine,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.760]   then don't wait until you see him to finally see him.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.560]   Because if you wait until you see him to finally see him,
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.400]   in that moment, it will be too late.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.240]   Behold him, behold him now.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.480]   When I first started driving and I got my license,
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.200]   a class A restriction was placed on my license,
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.680]   which simply means that I have to wear corrective lenses
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.520]   when I'm driving.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.400]   But the reason I have glasses
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.520]   is that I have an astigmatism in my right eye,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.400]   but my left eye sees perfectly fine.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.160]   And so I just learned at an early age,
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.520]   I could just let my left eye do the heavy lifting
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.960]   and I just don't need to wear glasses.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.760]   So I got my license, I started driving
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.360]   and I opted not to wear glasses
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.640]   because I thought that that class A restriction
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.520]   was more of a suggestion than a necessity
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.080]   because my eyesight seemed perfectly fine.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.800]   And so I drove for two years without corrective lenses
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.240]   and when I turned 18 and I had to go get my license renewed,
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.200]   I'd done so well at driving that I just assumed,
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.120]   here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.760]   I'm gonna go to the Department of Public Safety
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.240]   and I'm gonna take the eye test without my glasses
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.600]   and I'm gonna show them I don't need glasses
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.680]   so they can remove the class A restriction from my license.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.600]   So I walked, I waited in line, got up to the counter
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.960]   and the lady told me to put my face into the eye viewer
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.360]   and to read line three of the eye chart
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.200]   that was in this little viewer.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.960]   Anytime you go to the eye doctor
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.240]   and you read a line like perfectly,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.080]   maybe it's just me,
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.720]   but do you ever feel like a deep pride?
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.440]   Like, that was impressive, wasn't it?
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.160]   Like, do you ever read it and then look at the eye doctor
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.880]   and you're like, what's up now?
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.480]   Like, that's what I felt.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.040]   She asked me to read line three
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.360]   and I would say I crushed line three.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.840]   Like, I pulled my face out,
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.600]   kind of expecting her to be like,
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.000]   that was good.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.720]   But instead, she looked confused.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.040]   And she looked at me and she said, you didn't finish.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.400]   I was like, what do you mean?
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.840]   She was like, you didn't read column three.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.040]   So there was three columns.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.120]   She wanted me to read line three
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.600]   all the way across three columns.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.000]   I was like, there was only two columns.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.400]   She was like, no, you didn't read column three.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.040]   Column three happened to be on the right side
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.640]   and I just happened to have an astigmatism on my right eye.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.040]   So I put my face back up to the viewer,
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.640]   but this time I put my left eye where my right eye went
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.160]   and guess what I saw?
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.200]   Column three.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.000]   It was crazy.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.640]   If anyone wants to go for a ride afterward tonight,
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.440]   happy to give you a lift home.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.120]   Be a perfectly safe ride.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:57.120]   But what was interesting is that I realized in that moment
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.200]   that just because I couldn't see it
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.760]   doesn't mean it wasn't there.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.600]   And the same is true with Jesus.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.560]   Just because you can't see it
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.680]   doesn't mean that there isn't more to see.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.520]   What's interesting is I walked out of the DPS
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.880]   and I still didn't wear my glasses driving
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.880]   for at least another decade.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:27.800]   Just think about what I was saying without saying it.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.120]   I was basically saying, I know that there's more to see,
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.720]   I just don't care to see it.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.160]   Here's the reality.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.240]   If you're here tonight, I believe that God has,
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.440]   it's not an accident.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.600]   I don't think it's a mistake.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.960]   I think that God has brought you here
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.920]   to show himself to you.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.440]   I believe that Jesus Christ is trying to speak
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.640]   into your life and reveal himself to you.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.880]   Don't be a person who leaves here tonight
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.280]   knowing that there is more to see
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.520]   while being content not to see it.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   Don't wait until you see him to finally see him.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.320]   So how do you see Jesus?
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.680]   Like what does it look like to cultivate spiritual sight?
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.200]   If Jesus is coming back
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.880]   and you wanna have the right perspective,
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.080]   how do you begin to cultivate spiritual sight?
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.880]   Well, what you're doing right now is a great start.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.960]   Like come to the porch every Tuesday night
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.640]   because part of our mission is to show you Jesus.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.360]   Like if you come here and you don't get
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.920]   a clear picture of Jesus, we have failed.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.440]   That's why the porch exists, for you to see Jesus.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.920]   Come every Tuesday night.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.400]   Like I'm so encouraged by some of you here.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.320]   Like you, it was extremely inconvenient
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.200]   for you to come tonight.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.480]   Like you left work early
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.520]   and you're going back to work tonight.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.040]   You will be on your laptop for a few more hours tonight.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.160]   Some of you guys skipped dinner to be here tonight.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.880]   It's amazing.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.680]   So encouraging.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.760]   Keep coming.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.640]   Jesus will meet you here.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.480]   Take his word and begin to read it.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.920]   You know what, if you're new to the Bible,
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.960]   then my encouragement is to take another book
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.520]   that John wrote called "The Gospel of John."
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.040]   It's 21 chapters.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.120]   Take one chapter a day and read it.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.520]   I promise you, you will begin to see Jesus.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.000]   Read it with a group of friends.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.320]   Read it with a group of friends.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.720]   Begin to pray to Jesus each day.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.920]   Here's a great prayer for you to pray.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.920]   Jesus, I want to see more of you.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.240]   Jesus, please show me more of yourself.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.600]   That is a prayer that he loves to answer.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.120]   Begin to see Jesus.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.640]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.240]   When you hear that Jesus is coming back one day,
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.400]   when we say we want to live with the right perspective,
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.320]   because John just told us he is coming with the clouds,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.200]   you know what our tendency can be in our hearts?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.160]   And I feel it, our tendency,
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.480]   when I tell you Jesus is coming back someday,
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.680]   you know what our tendency is?
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.200]   It's to say, yeah, he will come back someday.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.680]   Like it's somewhere in the distant future.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.720]   It's someday, but it won't be this day.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.160]   But here's the thing, people for 2,000 years
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.520]   have been assuming it'll be someday,
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.160]   but it won't be this day.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.280]   Eventually, some generation is gonna be wrong
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.280]   because someday is going to become today
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.200]   and Jesus is gonna come back.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.840]   May it not be our generation
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.600]   that assumes he'll come back someday, but not today.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.160]   Let's be people who live as if Jesus is coming back.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.520]   Now, we don't want to just have the right perspective.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.400]   We need to make sure that we have the right person.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.760]   We want to live with the right person.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.240]   When I say we want to live with the right person,
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.040]   I'm basically saying we want to make sure
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.200]   that we have the right Jesus.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.960]   Jesus is the second person of the Trinity.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.920]   He is one of the three co-equal, co-eternal persons
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:13.920]   that exist in one essence as God.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.560]   Do you have the right Jesus?
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.440]   John gets a vision in Revelation chapter one
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.440]   of the post-resurrection Christ, the glorified Christ.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   And I just want to read you his vision.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.520]   It's amazing.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.080]   Look at what he sees, verse nine.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.040]   It says, "I, John, your brother and partner
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.320]   "in the tribulation and the kingdom
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.360]   "and the patient endurance that are in Jesus
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.280]   "was on the island called Patmos."
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.960]   Remember, he's exiled.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.560]   On account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.200]   "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day,"
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.960]   which just means that the Spirit of God
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.360]   has taken over his mind and his heart,
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.520]   so he's going to begin to see visions of Jesus.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.360]   "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.720]   "and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying,
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.780]   "'Write what you see in a book.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.860]   "'Send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus,
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.040]   "'and to Smyrna, and to Pergamum, to Thyatira,
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.400]   "'to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.'"
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.320]   It's important that he's writing to seven churches
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.160]   because in the Bible, seven signifies completion.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.960]   And so while he is writing this letter to seven churches,
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.360]   it's not just for these seven churches,
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:35.360]   it is for the complete group of churches of all time.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.680]   So it's for this church, Watermark Community Church,
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.500]   for the people who come to this church.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.440]   Now watch this, this is where it gets good, verse 12.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.200]   It says, "Then I turned to see the voice
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.880]   "that was speaking to me, and on turning,
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.080]   "I saw seven golden lambstands."
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.840]   Those golden lambstands, it's a vision of the seven churches.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.840]   Remember, churches exist to be lights in dark places.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.660]   Churches exist to put the glory of God on display.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.000]   And in the midst of the lambstands,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.080]   one like a son of man, that's Jesus,
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.760]   he's clothed with a long robe
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.720]   and with a golden sash around his chest.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.680]   The hairs of his head were white,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.280]   like white wool, like snow.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.080]   His eyes were like a flame of fire.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.440]   His feet were like burnished bronze,
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.680]   refined in a furnace, and his voice was like
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.200]   the roar of many waters.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.300]   In his right hand, he held seven stars.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.800]   From his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.360]   and his face was like the sun, shining in full strength.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.600]   So don't miss what I'm telling you.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   We are not meant to take this vision literally.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.860]   This isn't telling us what Jesus physically looks like,
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.040]   but we are to take it seriously
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.080]   because it is informing us of who Jesus is
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.200]   and what his character is like.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.160]   So the question is, do you know the right Jesus?
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.840]   Are you living with the right person?
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:06.560]   Here's an important way for me to explain it.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.080]   Okay, when I was in my mid-20s,
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.840]   I sat across the table from an older man.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.400]   We were eating barbecue at Rudy's,
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.360]   and here's what he said to me.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.640]   He said, "TA, here's what you need to know.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.320]   "Your view of Jesus will determine your response to Jesus."
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.640]   That's important for you to realize.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.520]   Your view of Jesus will determine your response to Jesus.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.800]   This is how all relationships work.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.400]   Your view of a person determines
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.240]   how you respond to that person.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.800]   Just watch an engaged couple.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.240]   Like that guy will do anything for that girl,
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.960]   and that girl will do anything for that guy.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.900]   Like that guy will go to the store
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.000]   to buy feminine hygiene products for her.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.600]   He'll watch the notebook with her.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.360]   Like he'll do anything for her.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.200]   Why?
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.080]   Because he has such a big view of her.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.180]   He has a big response because he has a big view.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.560]   But just watch what happens
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.360]   when someone's view of a person changes.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.240]   When their view changes, their response changes.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.320]   When someone loses interest,
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:10.160]   they stop responding, they start ghosting.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.040]   Why?
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.340]   They have a small response because they have a small view.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.100]   So it's good for you to just answer this question.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.760]   Is your response to Jesus right now big or small?
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:28.000]   If you have a small response to Jesus right now,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.340]   then here's what the issue is.
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.460]   The issue is that you've got the wrong Jesus.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.780]   You've got the wrong Jesus.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.920]   And so that's why,
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.800]   if you want to live like Jesus is coming back,
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.980]   we just need to make sure that you've got the right Jesus.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.880]   And John shows us the right Jesus.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.720]   Look at it.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.560]   Let me just unpack what some of these things mean.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.920]   It says that Jesus is wearing a long robe
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.720]   with a golden sash.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.300]   These are articles of clothing that are worn by a priest.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.560]   In the Old Testament system,
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.680]   a priest was responsible for atoning
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.920]   for the sins of the nation of Israel once a year.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.700]   So once a year, a priest would enter the temple of God
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.240]   inside this very special room inside the temple,
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.680]   and he would sprinkle blood from a sacrificed animal
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.520]   onto the altar to atone for the sins
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.720]   of the nation of Israel.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.480]   Jesus is our priest because he atones for our sins,
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.940]   not with the blood of an animal,
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.840]   but with his own body and his own blood.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.560]   When he went to the cross and he declared,
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.960]   "It is finished," what was he finishing?
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.720]   He was finishing atoning for all of your sins
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.160]   and all of my sins.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.760]   And when he rose from the dead,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.040]   that was his declaration and demonstration
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.880]   that sin and death had been defeated for us.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.840]   This is what Christ has done for us.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.200]   And the reason that this is so important
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.760]   is because some of you walked in tonight
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.740]   carrying loads of shame because of where you've been
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.800]   and what you've done.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.700]   I just, I wonder if there's anyone in the room tonight
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:13.180]   that walked in here thinking, "I don't even belong here
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.620]   "because of where I've been and what I've done.
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.100]   "Jesus could never love me,
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.100]   "and Jesus could never forgive me.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.660]   "I've lied too much.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.980]   "I've cheated on too many people.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.360]   "I've cheated at work.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.880]   "I've stolen from others.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.820]   "I've had an abortion.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.580]   "I've lived a homosexual lifestyle.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.760]   "I have wronged people severely.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.740]   "I've bullied people in my past.
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:44.740]   "I've been drunk far too many times that I could ever count.
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.840]   "I've used too many drugs."
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.720]   Whatever it is, you need to know
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.800]   that is why Jesus went to the cross.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   He went to the cross to deal forever with sin.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.000]   With your sins in mind, He went to the cross
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.320]   to make a way for you and for me
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.200]   to be completely forgiven of our sins
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.380]   and to be brought into a real relationship with God.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.140]   It says that the hairs of His head were white,
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.560]   like white wool, like snow.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.280]   This is just talking about the wisdom
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.680]   and omniscience of God.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.680]   Girls, when you hear that His hair was white,
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.120]   when you get a white hair, you either pluck it or dye it.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.480]   Not Jesus, the whole hair.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.320]   It's white.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.600]   It's wisdom.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.680]   He knows everything.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.560]   There's nothing that He doesn't know.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.720]   And that's really important
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.680]   because many of you walked in here with no peace.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.680]   Like the last time you experienced peace was years ago.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:46.520]   We have no peace in our lives.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.680]   We live with restlessness.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.520]   We're constantly wrestling.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.120]   We're constantly anxious.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:53.960]   Why?
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.360]   Thinking about our future.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.360]   Like I wonder if your future causes you stress and anxiety.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.000]   Am I ever gonna meet someone?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.120]   Am I ever gonna get married?
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.560]   Am I ever going to finally find
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.880]   what I'm supposed to do with my life?
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.600]   Am I ever gonna land in a job
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.440]   that is actually meaningful and satisfying
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.040]   and not miserable to me?
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.840]   Here's the thing, Jesus knows.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.040]   He sees your future now.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.840]   And He doesn't just see it, He's in control of it.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.440]   Colossians 1:17 says that Jesus is before all things
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:37.440]   and in Him all things hold together, including your life.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:43.600]   It says that His eyes were like a flame of fire.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.680]   This is speaking of the penetrating insight
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.480]   and discernment of Jesus.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.600]   It means that nothing is hidden from His sight.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.000]   He always knows exactly what is going on
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.920]   below the surface of every man and woman.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.760]   So don't miss this.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.600]   This is saying that Jesus sees below the surface
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.440]   into our hearts.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.560]   And this is so important because so many of us
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.680]   just want to play religious games with Jesus.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.560]   Like you're here at the porch tonight
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.080]   to make you feel better about yourself.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.920]   Like this is, the porch is just kind of like,
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.480]   it's like Tylenol.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.800]   It just kind of deals with some of the pain
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.640]   that you're dealing with.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.040]   It's kind of a quick hit,
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.240]   but then you're gonna kind of go
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.520]   and you're gonna continue in brokenness this week.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.360]   Let's be clear, coming to the porch isn't what saves you.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:35.160]   It's the Jesus that the porch proclaims that can save you.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:39.520]   Jesus doesn't want to play religious games.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.760]   He's not looking like, oh good, you showed up to the porch.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.320]   Okay, so we're good for another week.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.680]   Okay, see you next Tuesday.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.000]   No, He cares about your heart.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.680]   He will not settle for anything less than a relationship
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.760]   that is founded upon an everlasting, unconditional love
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.520]   that is birthed through Him.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.080]   Do you know that love?
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:06.440]   It says that His feet were like burnished bronze.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.280]   In the ancient world,
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.680]   shoes worn by soldiers were incredibly important.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.560]   If a soldier didn't have the right shoes,
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.760]   their feet would be bloody and blistered in battle
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   and it would impact their ability to fight.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.560]   Jesus' bronze feet are stable
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.600]   and able to crush His enemies.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.320]   This is just simply declaring that He is victorious.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.480]   He is a conquering King.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.320]   And that is incredibly good news
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   because someone walked in tonight feeling beat up by sin.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:37.200]   Like I wonder if there's anyone here tonight
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.720]   that just feels beaten down, whipped by their sin.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.480]   Like you're drowning in your sin.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.560]   Like you're walking around in chains to your sin,
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.880]   whether it's porn, whether it's a sex addiction
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.480]   or just consistently drinking too much or drugs
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.520]   or whatever it is.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.280]   It's an attachment, an unhealthy attachment to social media.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.560]   It's an addiction to people's approval.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.880]   Maybe it's eating too much or starving yourself.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.800]   I don't know what it is.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.960]   But if you're here tonight
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.960]   and you feel beaten up by your sin, there is hope.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.360]   And His name is Jesus,
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.200]   who is the victorious conquering King.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.320]   I don't have an answer for you.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.000]   If you're looking for a motivational speech,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.160]   I'll just tell you, you know what?
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.960]   You can do it and just try harder and be stronger
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960]   and you will overcome.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.760]   I cannot assure you of that.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.360]   But what I can assure you of is that Jesus Christ
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.800]   went to the cross and conquered your sin.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.760]   And He loves you.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.920]   He has fought for you.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.400]   He has already won on your behalf.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.680]   And He can deliver you from the power of your sin.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.320]   Will you trust Him to do that?
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:00.680]   It says that His voice was like the roar of many waters.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.280]   The sound of our King's voice.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.440]   It's a thundering voice communicating
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.320]   His power, majesty and sovereignty.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.200]   It says in His right hand, He held seven stars.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.000]   That just means that He's in control.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.520]   It says from His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.200]   This refers to His words.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.320]   Jesus' words are able to penetrate
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.200]   and judge those who oppose Him.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.440]   Let me just say this.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.280]   If you're here tonight and you got tricked into being here,
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.800]   someone was like, let's go to happy hour
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.280]   and they drove you here.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.840]   Like, I'm glad you made it.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.560]   But like, if you hear all this and you're like,
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.200]   I do not give a rip about Jesus.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.160]   Let me just tell you this.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.080]   You do not wanna go toe to toe with Jesus.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.880]   You will not be able to stand on your own two feet
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.400]   in His presence.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:00.680]   And then it says His face shone like the sun.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.160]   Just think back to when you were a kid.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.600]   Did you ever have a staring contest with the sun?
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.480]   Like someone dared you?
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.320]   You look at the sun.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.400]   Somebody else did it yesterday, but you look at the sun
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.160]   and you've got like, you've got tears
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.640]   kind of pouring down your face.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.520]   You're beginning to see spots.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.080]   It's the brilliance of the sun.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.200]   Your eyes are so limited in their capacity
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.160]   to behold the sun for any longer
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.720]   than just a couple seconds.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.080]   That idea is being attributed to Jesus.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.080]   That if He were to walk in right now,
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.520]   no one would turn around and be like,
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.760]   "No, so that's Jesus."
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.480]   No, we'd be like, "Oh my gosh, who turned the lights up?"
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.760]   Like it would be blinding.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.960]   Not because of His physical brightness,
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.760]   but because of the character of Jesus Christ
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.880]   that He is the essence of beauty.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:06.640]   He is overwhelmingly, breathtakingly beautiful.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.000]   Do you know this beautiful Jesus that I'm talking about?
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Last night, sitting at the table, I've got three boys.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.920]   They're 13, 11, and five.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.120]   And we've got these little, they're like flashcards.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.760]   They're the alphabet, and with each letter of the alphabet,
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.120]   there's an attribute of Jesus.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.120]   So last night was B, and the B stood for beautiful.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.280]   That Jesus is beautiful.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.440]   So we went around the table, and I was just asking my kids,
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.240]   "Hey, what are things in this world
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.200]   that you think are beautiful?"
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.520]   And so we're talking about different things.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.720]   Somehow one of them brings up like video games and screens.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.000]   I'm like, "It's kind of a stretch,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.440]   but okay, we'll go with it."
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.680]   But at the end, to kind of pull it all together,
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.520]   I was like, "You know what?
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.680]   There are many different things that are beautiful.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.760]   Songs are beautiful.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.840]   Paintings are beautiful.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.840]   Pictures are beautiful.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.240]   Mountains are beautiful."
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:07.040]   God, through the eternal word, who we now know as Jesus,
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.560]   God, give me a second.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.680]   Just so choked up talking about beauty.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:23.080]   It hurts so bad.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.600]   Oh, I can do this.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.920]   I can do all things for Him who strengthens me.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.720]   Got tears in my eyes, not because of our conversation,
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.560]   but because it hurts right here.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:48.080]   But I just told them, Jesus made beautiful things.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:48.920]   Why?
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.000]   To show us His beauty.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.440]   That when we would see beauty,
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.400]   we weren't to terminate on that and be like,
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.440]   "That is the pinnacle of beauty,"
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.040]   but that we would look at the mountains.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.120]   We would listen to music.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.720]   We would look at paintings and we would say,
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.520]   "That is just a hint.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:12.600]   It's just a taste of the beauty of our King."
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.040]   Do you know that, Jesus?
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.560]   Have you ever been captivated by His beauty?
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.800]   Because He is.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.320]   Is this the Jesus you know?
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.360]   Are you living with the right person?
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.840]   'Cause here's the reality.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.680]   If you listen to this description of Jesus
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.360]   and something in you is like, "Yeah, that feels different,"
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.680]   then maybe you've had the wrong Jesus.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.520]   If you're here tonight,
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.800]   I wanna speak to a very specific group.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.320]   If you are here tonight
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.000]   and you consider yourself a Christian,
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.640]   but you have not been walking with Jesus,
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.400]   let me tell you why that is.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.480]   It's 'cause you've had the wrong Jesus.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:07.200]   And if you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.000]   you know what's happening is you're being introduced
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.160]   to the right Jesus for the first time.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.960]   The right thing to do is to come to Him.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.600]   Would you come to Him tonight?
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.120]   So we wanna have the right perspective.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.800]   We wanna live with the right person.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.640]   Then finally, we wanna have the right posture.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.040]   We wanna have the right posture to Jesus.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:35.800]   I know how hard it is for y'all to listen to me
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.920]   talk like this.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:44.920]   I want you to see John's posture right here, verse 17.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.240]   Look at what it says.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.040]   Okay, I'm good.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:57.600]   It says, "When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead,
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.160]   "but He laid His right hand on me saying,
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.880]   "'Fear not, I'm the first and the last.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.440]   "'And the living one, I died,
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.800]   "'and behold, I'm alive forevermore.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.920]   "'And I have the keys of death and Hades.'"
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.400]   I love this 'cause Jesus sees the glorified Christ
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.240]   and what is His involuntary response?
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.520]   He falls on the ground dead.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.080]   He's like, "There He is, I'm dead."
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.400]   Jesus is like, "You're not dead, man, get up."
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.800]   But the interesting thing is that this isn't,
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.960]   this isn't the first time that this happens in Scripture.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.360]   If you go and you read through the Scriptures,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.960]   you know what you see is that anytime someone sees Jesus,
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.120]   you know what their response is, they fall on the ground.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.240]   So like Ezekiel, when he sees Jesus, look at what it says.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.560]   Ezekiel 1, 28, it says, "Such was the appearance
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.080]   "of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.120]   "And when I saw it, I fell on my face."
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.760]   It's like our bodies just know
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.840]   that when you see Jesus, you fall.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.720]   It's involuntary, you don't have to tell your knees
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.080]   to buckle, your knees are like, "No, I know what to do.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.120]   "I see Him and I fall."
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.800]   Is there anyone in your life that does that to you?
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.440]   Like they just walk into the room and you're just like,
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.320]   like, "Wow, I did not see that coming."
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.120]   "Please forgive me."
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:26.240]   "But you walked in and I saw you
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.480]   "and I ended up down there."
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.880]   No.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.640]   Your body has been made to respond
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.560]   to only one person like that, and it's Jesus Christ.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.600]   Why?
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.840]   Why would your knees buckle if Jesus walked through
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.680]   that door?
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.200]   Because you've been made to worship.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.280]   You realize that, right?
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.920]   You have been made to worship.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.920]   If you don't believe me, just go look at my kids.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.240]   Like my kids are made to worship.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.520]   You're like, "Of course they have been, you're a pastor."
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.600]   No, what I'm talking about is I'm talking about
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.880]   when my kids were two years old,
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.520]   they worshiped Lightning McQueen, the movie "Cars."
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.920]   Then when they got older, it was "Monster Zing,"
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.920]   Mike Kowalski.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.880]   Then it was "Star Wars."
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.240]   Then it was "Jurassic World."
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.720]   Then it was "Harry Potter."
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.920]   They'd move from one thing to the next.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.760]   Their affection would be focused on one thing,
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.240]   then they would move on to the next.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.080]   You know what our toy closet is?
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.040]   It is a graveyard to failed gods.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.840]   Because over time, you know what happens?
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.520]   Is glory fades.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:40.520]   And the thing that they thought they needed
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.080]   can't satisfy 'em like it once did.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:49.200]   So your soul has been made to worship Jesus Christ,
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.720]   and your knees will only buckle
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.520]   for the one that they've been made to worship.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.000]   And that is Jesus.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.280]   So what is the right posture?
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.600]   Like I want you to live,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.880]   not just with the right perspective or the right person,
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.840]   I want you to live with the right posture
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.240]   toward the right person.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:09.920]   The right posture is one of full surrender.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.560]   It's one of full surrender.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.120]   That Jesus wouldn't just be a part of your life,
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.640]   but that he would be the point and passion of your life.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.480]   Because here's the thing,
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.280]   when you see the right Jesus,
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.600]   then you realize that for Jesus to be a part of your life,
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.200]   but not the point of your life,
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.960]   is to waste your life.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.640]   Because you've been made for him.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.720]   So here's the question, how do we close the gap
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:41.000]   between completely ignoring Jesus
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.960]   and falling on our faces before him?
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.520]   Like how do we close that gap?
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.120]   Well, the text tells us, look really quickly.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.080]   Verse 17, it says,
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.040]   "When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead,
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.120]   "but he laid his right hand on me saying,
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:59.120]   "'Fear not, I am the first and the last.'"
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.160]   He says, "I'm the first and the last."
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.680]   So here's the thought, Jesus is saying,
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.680]   "Look, I'm the first, like I was there in the beginning.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.240]   "I'm the last, I'll be there in the end.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.320]   "And I was there at every second in between."
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.200]   Like what stands at the crux of history,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.640]   it's the cross and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.400]   When Jesus says, "I'm the first and the last,"
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:23.120]   he's just saying that everything is about me.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.280]   He's the point of everything.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:33.000]   You wanna live with the right posture?
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.120]   Then come to this understanding,
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.960]   Jesus doesn't exist for you, you exist for him.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   If there is only one thing you do today,
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.720]   if there's only one thing you do today,
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:54.720]   see Jesus, know Jesus, and help others do the same.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:59.520]   And then look at what he says.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:06.960]   Verse 18, he says, "Fear not, I'm the first and the last,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.800]   "and the living one, I died.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.560]   "And behold, I'm alive forevermore.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.640]   "And I have the keys to death and Hades."
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.760]   Do you know what Jesus is saying?
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.160]   He's saying if you want to experience eternal life
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.080]   with God in heaven when you die,
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.880]   it's gonna have everything to do with me.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.760]   He says, "I hold the keys to death and Hades."
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.360]   When you have the keys to something,
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:32.040]   that means that you have the access, you have the authority.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:36.040]   Jesus is saying if you're gonna experience eternal life
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.720]   in heaven with God when you die,
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.720]   it will have everything to do with me.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.680]   And some of y'all hear that and you're like,
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.360]   that's the problem with Christianity.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.880]   It's so exclusive, it's so controlling.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:54.240]   Like if I don't do everything that Jesus says,
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.800]   if I don't get on board with Jesus,
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   then you're telling me that God won't save me?
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.360]   It's exclusive, it's controlling.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.600]   It's not controlling, it's loving.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.240]   Why do I say that?
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:16.720]   Because tell me, what are you and I gonna do
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.760]   as imperfect people to make ourselves right
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.640]   with a perfect God?
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.920]   What are we gonna do?
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.040]   Like what are you gonna do in your own strength?
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.280]   What am I gonna do in my own strength, an imperfect person?
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:34.280]   What could I possibly do to make myself right
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.520]   with a perfect God?
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.960]   Well, we're like, well, you know what?
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.920]   I just try really hard and I live a pretty good life
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.160]   and I don't smoke too much weed
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.520]   and I don't drink too much anymore.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.240]   Like I try and do good, but we're still imperfect
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.800]   and he is perfect.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.240]   If God is perfect and heaven is perfect
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.640]   and we are imperfect, how does it make sense
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.640]   for imperfect people to live in a perfect place
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.640]   with a perfect God?
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.240]   Our imperfection would make that perfection imperfection.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.040]   And so what we need is a perfect God
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.000]   who would leave heaven and come to earth
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.040]   to seek and save that which was lost or imperfect.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.120]   And that's what Jesus Christ has done
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.840]   is he has made a way for that which is imperfect
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.800]   to be reconciled to a perfect God.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.160]   So when Jesus Christ says that he holds the keys
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.240]   to death and Hades, he's not trying to keep you out.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.360]   All he's saying is I made a way in
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.120]   when there was no way in.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.400]   When there was no way, I made a way
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.840]   because I love you.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.240]   Do you know him?
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.240]   When I was doing college ministry in College Station,
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.840]   a ministry called Breakaway, there was this,
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:51.200]   it's always good to be in the room with some Aggies.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   There was this girl I met named Amber
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.920]   and she came from a Muslim background.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.080]   She grew up Muslim.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:02.440]   And there was this volunteer with Breakaway
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.440]   who began to invite her to come to Breakaway
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.400]   and Amber did not want to come to Breakaway.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.520]   So this Breakaway volunteer named Lauren,
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.920]   she just kept after her.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.040]   Like she just hounded her to come to Breakaway.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.200]   And finally Amber just gave up.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.440]   She was like, okay, I'll go to Breakaway.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.600]   So she came to Breakaway.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.320]   She began to hear about Jesus.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.440]   She began to go to church.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.840]   She began to hear about Jesus.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.400]   And then Amber, this girl with a Muslim background
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.640]   showed up in my office.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.960]   And she articulated the good news of Christianity to me
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.840]   better than I had ever heard from any Christian.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:42.840]   And then she put her trust in Jesus Christ.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:47.840]   Do you want to know what the pivot point was for her?
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.800]   It was grace.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.680]   Because all of her life,
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:00.720]   she had heard about what she needed to do for God.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.560]   And she got to college and she began to party.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.600]   And she felt like a failure.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.680]   She felt like she could no longer,
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.320]   there was no way for God to love her.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:17.720]   And then she heard not about what she needed to do for God,
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.480]   but what God had done for her in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.040]   But Jesus Christ got on a cross and died for her sins,
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.720]   just like Jesus died for your sins and mine.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.200]   And Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.040]   conquering sin and death for you and for me.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.000]   She gave her life to Jesus, why?
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.040]   Because of grace.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.480]   Have you experienced that grace?
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.760]   Do you know this Jesus?
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.920]   We want to be people who live like Jesus is coming back.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.640]   May we be people who live with the right perspective.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.040]   May we live with the right person.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.000]   May we live with the right posture.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.400]   One of full surrender.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.640]   So here's what I want to ask.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.960]   Here's the right way to respond to this talk.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.360]   Before you leave tonight,
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:05.160]   look, if you don't know Jesus, surrender to him tonight.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:10.080]   What is keeping you from giving your life to Jesus?
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.560]   If you consider yourself a Christian,
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.520]   but you haven't been walking with Jesus,
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.280]   return to Jesus tonight.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.080]   And then when you get home tonight,
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.320]   text some of your friends and just tell them,
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.120]   "Hey, let's go all in with Jesus together.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.320]   "Let's live like he's coming back."
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.800]   And then every day this week, wake up, hit your knees,
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.400]   and just say, "Jesus, you don't exist for me.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.040]   "I exist for you.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.720]   "You can have your way with my life."
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.800]   Let's pray together.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.600]   Lord Jesus, I pray for my friends in this room
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.760]   who don't know you.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.000]   I pray that if there's anyone in this room
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.600]   that does not know you,
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.600]   may they just sense right now
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.080]   that you are reaching into their life
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.360]   and calling them to yourself.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:10.240]   And may they put their hope and their trust in you.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.840]   And if there's anyone here tonight
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:16.680]   who has been a Christian for a long time,
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.080]   that they've been in a season of wandering
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.720]   and haven't been walking with you,
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.320]   I pray that they just return,
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.040]   that they would just feel your embrace
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.880]   and know your grace tonight.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:31.840]   Thank you that you're a good king,
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.280]   that you love us, Lord Jesus, that you came for us,
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:40.240]   that you can be our peace because you're in control.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.840]   You hold our lives in your hands.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.160]   Thank you that you hold the keys to death in Hades.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.760]   That brings comfort,
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:51.520]   that you're the one completely in control of our lives now
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.440]   and our lives even after we die.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.760]   Lord Jesus, we need you.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.600]   We love you.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:02.320]   Whether you come back someday or you come back this day,
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:06.720]   may you find us as people who are living
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:10.320]   with complete clarity and urgency,
