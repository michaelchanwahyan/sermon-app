1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
 - For freedom in the history of our nation.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,520
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,620
 - Dallas and Fort Worth.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,320
 - We're advancing the state of the art in every aspect.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,920
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:23,400
 - All right, well, welcome back for week two

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,240
 of revolution or new year revolution.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,860
 I'm gonna start off by opening up a little bit about my life.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,240
 Yes, sir, thank you for being excited mom on the front row.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,040
 It's not my mom.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,800
 When I got married about four and a half years ago,

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,980
 I moved in with my wife, Callie.

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,480
 It was exciting times.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,480
 I was immediately exposed to some things I was not aware of

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,020
 as it related to what it looked like to live with a woman.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,180
 And they were numerous,

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,160
 but the ones that are relevant to tonight

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,760
 was specifically around wardrobe or clothing.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,820
 One of the first things that I realized

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,160
 was the vast volume of clothes

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,760
 that women bring into their life

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,940
 and that they're gonna carry with them for like forever.

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,300
 There's clothes and shirts that I still to this day

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,800
 have never seen anywhere

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,440
 other than just hanging in the closet.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,600
 And I have never, we've been in three different homes.

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,340
 I've never actually made it to where my clothes

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,320
 are in the closet inside of our bedroom.

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,440
 I have all my clothes in like the hallway closet

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,120
 with a vacuum over there.

31
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,020
 And she's like every square inch I need.

32
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,860
 And the second thing was not just the volume,

33
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,860
 but was more the accessories that women wear.

34
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,360
 And this was interesting to me

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,140
 because women will wear these accessories that are not,

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,640
 they're, I don't know how else to say this,

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,080
 they're pointless.

38
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,700
 They don't actually provide any value

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,280
 or any functional value.

40
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,740
 They just kind of, they're to look pretty

41
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,780
 and they're just kind of like, oh, this is fun.

42
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,080
 Here's what I mean.

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,380
 Like my wife has these things called summer scarves.

44
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,680
 Have you heard of this?

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,520
 It's a scarf you wear in the summer.

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,820
 What's a scarf for?

47
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,020
 It's for keeping your neck warm in the winter

48
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,460
 when it's snowing outside.

49
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,760
 But why do we, I think this is a Texas thing

50
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,100
 and anthropology thing, but we wear summer scarves

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,460
 so that we don't feel like we're missing out,

52
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,700
 I guess, on what's up north.

53
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,940
 Another thing was like she would,

54
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,700
 when we would go to nice events,

55
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,480
 she brings something called a clutch.

56
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,540
 I've never heard of this before.

57
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,800
 I didn't know what this was.

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,980
 I actually thought it was a grab

59
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
 and called it a grab for a while.

60
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,240
 I was like, where's your grab?

61
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,080
 She's like, what are you talking about?

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,120
 [congregation laughing]

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,380
 A clutch, for those of you men

64
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,340
 who are in the room who don't know what,

65
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,360
 this is a smaller version of the purse

66
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,780
 that you bring with you whenever you're going

67
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,020
 to a formal activity, a formal event

68
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,960
 that you're attending together.

69
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,820
 Is there anything in the clutch?

70
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,320
 No, you just put your phone in there,

71
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,800
 but you bring it as an accessory.

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,300
 It's like, what, this makes no sense at all.

73
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,500
 She has these belts that she wears

74
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
 on the outside of her clothing

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,400
 that are holding nothing up,

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,100
 which is the purpose of a belt.

77
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,900
 They just kind of like are around a dress.

78
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,440
 It's like, that's like wearing suspenders

79
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,780
 that are not attached to anything.

80
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,880
 You know that, right?

81
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,780
 [congregation laughing]

82
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,440
 Sleeveless turtlenecks,

83
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,620
 where it's like, I'm confused right now.

84
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,580
 Are we hot?

85
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,660
 Are we cold?

86
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,380
 You can't, this can't actually be functionally helping you

87
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,960
 because if you're wearing it because you're hot,

88
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,460
 you know that your neck is covered up.

89
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,160
 If you're wearing it because you're cold,

90
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,700
 you know that you have nothing on your,

91
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,300
 there's just these items of clothing,

92
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,000
 accessories predominantly, where I was like,

93
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,840
 man, what is that?

94
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,560
 What's a bangle?

95
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
 What is a bangle?

96
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,500
 Bangles, bracelets, these different things

97
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,040
 that I was exposed to that were accessories,

98
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,080
 definitely not a necessity,

99
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,740
 and they really didn't add any functional value

100
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,580
 if you were to take them away.

101
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,520
 Now, here's where I start there,

102
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,780
 because I think for a lot of us,

103
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,820
 as it relates to that idea of like,

104
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,040
 man, they're accessories,

105
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,580
 they're definitely not a necessity.

106
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,280
 That's how the Christian faith is.

107
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,860
 That in our life, or in your life,

108
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,360
 or in the lives of many people,

109
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,460
 that they see Christianity,

110
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,560
 they see their Christian faith,

111
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,420
 they see Christ as kind of an accessory.

112
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,320
 It's a component that I add to my life.

113
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,600
 It's part of who I am.

114
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,640
 You know, I'm a white guy who's X number of years old.

115
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,000
 I'm a girl who's African American.

116
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,940
 I'm a Republican or I'm a Democrat.

117
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,440
 I'm from Dallas or I'm from, you know,

118
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,780
 South Carolina or wherever I am,

119
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,880
 and I'm a Cowboys fan.

120
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,420
 I've got all these kind of different components.

121
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,340
 I'm an accountant, I'm a teacher,

122
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,320
 and one of those components,

123
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,580
 or one of those accessories

124
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,480
 that's kind of a part of it,

125
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,260
 that's fun to have is Christianity, or Christ.

126
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,280
 And what I wanna talk about tonight

127
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,860
 is as we continue this series of revolution

128
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,520
 is what the Apostle Paul's gonna say,

129
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
 as it relates to you and I,

130
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,460
 that Christianity is no accessory.

131
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,960
 It is a necessity.

132
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,240
 If you were going to experience

133
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,840
 the abundant life that God has wired,

134
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,840
 designed, created you to experience,

135
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,540
 that Christ is not some component to add to life,

136
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,300
 but without him, you will not experience

137
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,440
 the life that you want.

138
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,000
 Some of you, because of not listening

139
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,680
 to the Apostle Paul's words tonight,

140
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
 your marriage will not last.

141
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,920
 Some of you are going to fall into addiction

142
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,260
 because of not listening to the Apostle Paul's words tonight

143
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,760
 as he talks about the importance of Christianity,

144
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
 that it is not an accessory that you add,

145
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,920
 it's not just some component of life,

146
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,060
 it is where life itself is found.

147
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,020
 And it is knowing that,

148
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,720
 and understanding how we walk in that,

149
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
 that the Apostle Paul says

150
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,100
 is gonna be the dividing line to determine the life,

151
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,600
 and really what your life is going to produce

152
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,260
 in terms of the pain, the death, the destruction,

153
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,540
 all that you're gonna bring into it,

154
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,640
 or the life, joy, peace, all of those things.

155
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,800
 So we're gonna be in the book of Galatians chapter five,

156
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,760
 we'll pick it up in verse 19.

157
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,240
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open to Galatians.

158
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,660
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Roman, Corinthians,

159
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,080
 Galatians, so if you hit Matthew,

160
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,520
 flip the Bible open halfway.

161
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,760
 The easiest way to get to any book of the Bible

162
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,020
 is this thing called a table of contents, all right?

163
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,120
 That's our little secret, don't tell anybody else.

164
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,640
 But that's in the front of the Bible.

165
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,820
 And if you turn there, it'll tell you where Galatians is.

166
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,800
 But we'll be in chapter five.

167
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,260
 If you don't have a Bible, we'll have it up on the screens.

168
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,040
 And we also have Bibles in the Welcome Center

169
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,980
 as a free gift to you.

170
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,880
 So if you don't have one, feel free to go out there

171
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,360
 and just say, "Hey, I wanted to take you guys

172
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,480
 "up on the free Bible that you guys have here."

173
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,040
 So we're gonna be in Galatians chapter five.

174
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,240
 We'll start in verse 16, really 19,

175
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,200
 but I'm gonna read 16 'cause it'll set us up

176
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,280
 kind of for where we're going.

177
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,760
 The Apostle Paul is right into the church of Galatia.

178
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,000
 Paul, artist or apostle formerly known as Saul,

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,020
 went and spent his life for the first half

180
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,360
 trying to kill Christianity, trying to stomp out Christians,

181
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,200
 meets Jesus, his life is radically changed,

182
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,920
 and all of a sudden he becomes one of the best missionaries

183
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,160
 the world has ever seen, or the best missionary.

184
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
 And he writes all these different letters

185
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,240
 to these churches in these different areas or cities

186
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
 in the ancient world.

187
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,680
 And so many of those are what's in the Bible,

188
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,280
 is those different letters that Paul wrote.

189
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,800
 This one he wrote to the churches in Galatia,

190
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,400
 and he wrote regarding how they're to now

191
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,360
 live out their Christian life.

192
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,700
 And in it he gives them an insight into what's at stake

193
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,720
 if they don't properly understand the life

194
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,600
 and the access to life that they have in Christ.

195
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,360
 Before we start, let me just say this.

196
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,660
 What he's about to dive into is related to the sin nature.

197
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,520
 And in order to give you a better understanding

198
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,840
 is what we're about to read, what the Bible says,

199
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,360
 and what experience testifies as you look around the world.

200
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,620
 Is there all is not as it seems

201
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,740
 because sin entered the world, death entered the world.

202
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,320
 When sin entered, disease came with it,

203
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,600
 and everything was broken and everything was fractured.

204
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,280
 In other words, when Adam and Eve

205
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,720
 are the beginnings of the human race,

206
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,680
 disobeyed God, sin entered the world,

207
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,360
 and everything was fractured.

208
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
 Human nature was fractured.

209
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,480
 The animal kingdom was fractured.

210
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,360
 Your DNA, your ability to fight off disease was fractured.

211
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,880
 And human nature was fractured.

212
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,180
 And that all of us have this broken sin nature

213
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,840
 that he's about to tell us what takes place

214
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
 as it relates to that sin nature.

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,120
 So verse 16 says this.

216
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,580
 So I, Paul says, live by the Spirit,

217
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,600
 and you will not gratify the desires,

218
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,320
 or you won't fulfill the desires of the sinful nature.

219
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,160
 So Paul's saying, hey, if you wanna avoid

220
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,920
 living by the sin nature, you've gotta live by the Spirit.

221
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,320
 In order to avoid that self-destructive thing inside of you,

222
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,680
 you gotta live by the Spirit.

223
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,760
 What's so bad about the sinful nature, Paul,

224
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,640
 which is human nature?

225
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,560
 You could insert human nature.

226
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,060
 He begins to tell us, here's what it is.

227
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,220
 Now the acts of the sinful nature, verse 19, are obvious.

228
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,920
 In other words, everyone, if you look around,

229
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,800
 it's easy to see people are messed up,

230
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,700
 left to themselves, without law,

231
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,160
 they're gonna just gravitate towards evil.

232
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,180
 Here's some of 'em.

233
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,680
 Sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery,

234
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,640
 idolatry, or worshiping anything other than God.

235
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,800
 Witchcraft, which is manipulating the supernatural

236
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,400
 for selfish reasons.

237
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,960
 Hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,

238
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,660
 selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, and envy.

239
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,760
 Drunkenness and orgies, or living for the weekend.

240
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,660
 These and the like, which is a Greek word

241
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,780
 for just et cetera, et cetera.

242
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,780
 I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this

243
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,420
 will not inherit the kingdom of God.

244
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,020
 Paul just laid out the symptoms of the sinful nature.

245
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,240
 If you take notes, you can write down

246
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
 the symptoms of the sinful nature.

247
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,500
 Why is the message of Christianity,

248
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,280
 why specifically is Christianity being a necessity

249
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,120
 so important?

250
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,820
 Well, the first idea that Paul gives us in this text

251
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,300
 and the Bible teaches is that you and I on our own

252
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,540
 without the presence of Christ or the spirit of God

253
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,060
 in our life left to ourselves, naturally, we're sinful.

254
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,540
 Like in other words, in neutral,

255
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,220
 all of us gravitate towards sin.

256
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,020
 It's so huge 'cause it's such this big idea

257
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,060
 that's being taught in the world

258
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,260
 and that maybe you're like, yeah, I kind of agree with that.

259
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,940
 You don't agree with that if you would say,

260
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,440
 yeah, I think everybody's pretty much a good person.

261
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,940
 You know, I was told that growing up

262
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,220
 and I think everyone inherently is a good person.

263
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,920
 That is not a biblical idea.

264
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,020
 That doesn't even make sense

265
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,860
 when you look outside of America.

266
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,580
 In America, we can kind of get away with that

267
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,860
 'cause we're like, yeah, you know, everything.

268
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,500
 We live in the Disney world of the world.

269
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,740
 When you look outside in the world around us,

270
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,940
 it's the wild, wild west.

271
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,480
 It becomes very, very clear

272
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,740
 that mankind is not good inherently.

273
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,600
 And Paul says, let me tell you why.

274
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,500
 You were born with the sin nature.

275
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,980
 You were born with a nature inside of you

276
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,160
 that naturally moves in the direction of sin.

277
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,380
 And he lays out some of the things that like,

278
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,820
 really, it makes it clear.

279
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,780
 This is why it's easy.

280
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,060
 No one had to work at sexual morality in here.

281
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,700
 Nobody's like, no, I've been really trying

282
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,420
 to up my porn game this year.

283
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,460
 No one had to work at that.

284
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,980
 No one had to work at jealousy.

285
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,740
 No one was like, man, I'm just so like,

286
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,740
 I'm so happy for you how thin you are.

287
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,760
 And look at me, I'm not, but I'm so happy for you.

288
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,660
 Everyone's easily bent towards like,

289
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,700
 oh my gosh, you're so skinny.

290
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,260
 You must be anorexic, I hate you.

291
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,260
 And that comes naturally, Paul says, hatred, racism.

292
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,860
 Paul says, man, you wanna know the biggest problem

293
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,700
 that mankind has.

294
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,660
 You wanna know the biggest problem that you have,

295
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,540
 the world has, is sin nature.

296
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,920
 I mean, we kind of know this intuitively.

297
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,380
 It's why we have laws, right?

298
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,340
 Like imagine if there was a day where,

299
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,800
 just that we're not laws.

300
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,220
 You can watch "The Purge."

301
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,980
 It gives you a movie of what it's like

302
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,220
 if there weren't laws on the land.

303
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,100
 The reason that we even have laws is 'cause we know,

304
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,780
 man, without these, if we just,

305
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,740
 if people could get away with whatever,

306
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,840
 there's no end to the evil that they would do.

307
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,260
 And so we have laws that kind of restrain

308
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,380
 and restrict the evil on our land.

309
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,300
 Because for a lot of us, I think the reason why

310
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,700
 a lot of husbands don't cheat on their wife

311
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,860
 is 'cause they think they'll get caught.

312
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,060
 And Paul says, you have sin nature.

313
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,820
 You're not a good person for not cheating on your wife.

314
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,600
 You wanna cheat on your wife.

315
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,940
 The reason a lot of people don't commit crime

316
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,020
 is because they're afraid of getting caught.

317
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,380
 Paul says, look, you have a sin-broken nature.

318
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,040
 These are the symptoms of this broken thing inside of you

319
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,420
 that you by yourself, in neutral, gravitate towards sin.

320
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,260
 You and I do.

321
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,300
 It's the reason why addictions take place.

322
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,260
 Think about that.

323
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,700
 People self-destruct themselves.

324
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,180
 I mean, I'm not even trying to cast judgment on that.

325
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,520
 I'm saying, think about that.

326
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,500
 Why would people do things that only hurt themselves?

327
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,100
 And Paul says, look, I can tell you why.

328
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,740
 It's because you and I have a sin nature.

329
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,980
 Human nature is sin nature.

330
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,100
 The Bible teaches all throughout it that, man,

331
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,160
 God looks down, people are not inherently good.

332
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,660
 Psalm 14, two and three says this.

333
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,620
 The Lord looks down from heaven on all mankind

334
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,800
 to see if there are any who understand,

335
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,700
 any who seek God.

336
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,100
 All have turned away.

337
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,500
 All have become corrupt.

338
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,120
 There is no one who does good, not even one.

339
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,140
 If you have ever been around even infants or toddlers

340
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,860
 or young kids, that's the easiest,

341
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,060
 clear illustration of seeing this.

342
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,900
 We're in this stage right now

343
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,140
 where all of our friends have toddlers.

344
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,100
 And so everywhere I look, there's little kids

345
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,920
 around us right now.

346
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,080
 A little toddler and they're all around us

347
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
 kind of all the time.

348
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,740
 Here's what I've never seen

349
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,480
 from any of these little rugrats running around.

350
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,920
 Never one time, whenever they're together

351
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,240
 and they're playing with little toys,

352
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,720
 never has any of them ever said,

353
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
 oh my gosh, they have my toy.

354
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,200
 No, yours, it's yours, you take it first.

355
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,680
 But constantly they will say, mine, mine, mine.

356
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,260
 And it's not even their toy.

357
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,760
 We're not even in our house.

358
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,920
 It's someone else's stuff.

359
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,660
 I'm like, that is not yours, that's not mine.

360
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,340
 Because they are from the womb

361
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,780
 able to have selfishness come out of them and say, mine.

362
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,100
 They weren't ever taught that.

363
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,700
 We don't go around our house, at my house,

364
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
 where I'm like, hey, oh my gosh, my wife, that's my pillow.

365
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,820
 Mine, that is mine, that's my pillow.

366
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
 You didn't see that from someone.

367
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,120
 It's natural.

368
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,340
 It comes naturally.

369
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,420
 Paul says, so it does with you.

370
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,340
 So it does with me.

371
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,940
 Sin nature, left to ourself.

372
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,480
 What comes is immorality, is sin.

373
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,340
 But he continues, and he really gives us

374
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,500
 the solution to the problems of the symptoms

375
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,260
 of this disease of sin.

376
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,740
 Here's what he says.

377
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,260
 But the fruit of the Spirit, that's the Spirit of God.

378
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,940
 The fruit is the same word for produce or offspring.

379
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,700
 What is produced in someone's life

380
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:47,140
 is love, is joy, is peace, patience, kindness,

381
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,760
 goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.

382
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,900
 The Apostle Paul says that when the Spirit of God

383
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,460
 comes into someone's life, that's what happens

384
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,180
 when you become a Christian, when a person puts their faith

385
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,740
 in what Christ did on the cross for them.

386
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,140
 Hey, I'm putting my faith that Jesus died in my place

387
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,220
 on the cross for my sin.

388
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,380
 He paid for it, and he came back alive

389
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,020
 to show the payment was more than enough, check cleared.

390
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,600
 When a person puts their faith in that,

391
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,100
 all of a sudden the Spirit of God comes into their life

392
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,060
 and begins to change and form their character.

393
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,340
 And the Apostle Paul says, hey, you know what happens

394
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,340
 when a person is led or governed by the Spirit of God?

395
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,860
 Something is produced.

396
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,820
 Love, what's love?

397
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
 Love is, the word here is used almost more like charity,

398
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,240
 'cause if you look around, you're like,

399
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,540
 man, a lot of people in our world

400
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,780
 are really passionate about love.

401
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,260
 This isn't like the flowery, like,

402
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,500
 hey, everything is love, man, you do you.

403
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,340
 This isn't that love.

404
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,020
 This is a love that's self-sacrificing.

405
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,120
 It's the word agape that says, man, I'm gonna die to myself,

406
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,960
 put you in front of myself.

407
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,700
 He says that's what the Spirit of God

408
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,300
 brings into someone's life.

409
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,320
 They all of a sudden, they begin to want to love people.

410
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,820
 Kindness is brought into their life.

411
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,660
 Joy is brought into their life.

412
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,180
 Peace, the supernatural peace,

413
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,460
 not like this just kind of temperamental surfer guy

414
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,140
 who's like, yeah, man, everything's gonna work out.

415
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,980
 It's gonna be good.

416
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,500
 But the supernatural peace comes into someone's life.

417
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,060
 Kindness, self-control.

418
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,300
 The Apostle Paul says, look,

419
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,320
 the remedy or the solution for the sin nature,

420
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,080
 which is our second idea, is the Spirit of God.

421
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,820
 For you and I to experience freedom from that sin nature,

422
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,860
 freedom from the symptoms of the sin nature

423
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,060
 that come into our life, Paul says,

424
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,220
 hey, there is a remedy.

425
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,600
 It does not come from within you.

426
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,980
 It comes from the Spirit of God inside of someone's life.

427
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,480
 I mean, how attractive are these qualities?

428
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,320
 I mean, think about it.

429
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,940
 Like, that is like, if you had a list and you were like,

430
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,360
 man, I'm looking for a spouse.

431
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,100
 This would be the amazing list to have.

432
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,440
 Nobody's like, nobody's going back to that other list

433
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,740
 of like, you know what I'm looking for?

434
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,300
 Someone who's a witch.

435
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,820
 I'm looking for a witchcraft.

436
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,660
 Hello.

437
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,420
 No one's looking for like a guy who's like,

438
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,100
 he's got an anger problem.

439
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,940
 I know a lot of you are like, no, I like, you know,

440
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,260
 tough, bad Barry.

441
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,440
 You don't like bad Barry when you marry Barry

442
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,120
 and he keeps punching holes in the wall.

443
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,020
 That's not the guy you wanna marry.

444
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,900
 Like, how attractive is this list of like,

445
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,460
 love, joy, peace, patience, you know,

446
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,060
 and it's kind of, that's what Paul says

447
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,980
 is what the Spirit wants to bring about

448
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,020
 in the life of a person.

449
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,020
 He wants to lead them in the direction of life.

450
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,940
 Lead them away from the direction of what's natural.

451
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,580
 He wants to come in and supernaturally bring about

452
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,620
 these things in your life and in my life.

453
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:32,620
 I mean, if you, if you think about how amazing

454
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,100
 the world would be if for like,

455
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,900
 imagine a world where everyone was governed

456
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,740
 by the Spirit of God.

457
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,820
 Just go with me on this.

458
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,780
 Every person on the planet, tomorrow we wake up,

459
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,620
 all of them underneath the governance

460
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,500
 of the Spirit of God.

461
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,240
 So they're not robots, they just have this fruit,

462
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,200
 this lifestyle being produced in them

463
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,860
 where love, joy, peace, patience, you know,

464
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,700
 it's kind of all this.

465
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,660
 I mean, think about it.

466
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,160
 We wouldn't have to have laws.

467
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,140
 Like, we could do away with the Constitution,

468
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,580
 do away with laws, do away with all of this.

469
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,680
 Is that bumping on me?

470
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,380
 Clearly it is.

471
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,780
 Oh, let's go, dude, okay.

472
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,380
 No more Britney Spears, Mike, I like it.

473
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,620
 I mean, seriously, stay with me.

474
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,460
 Imagine a world where you don't have any of those things.

475
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,460
 The sin nature no longer exists,

476
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,340
 or everyone's governed by the fruit of the Spirit.

477
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,940
 You guys talk amongst yourselves for a second,

478
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,820
 'cause this thing.

479
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:34,180
 Hey, how about Billy Wand?

480
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,220
 This guy, he is single, ladies.

481
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,660
 Kidding.

482
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,580
 Imagine a world, like, you wouldn't have to have laws.

483
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,180
 Think about that.

484
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,300
 Like, you wouldn't have to be worried about,

485
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,740
 like, oh my gosh, there's greed going on.

486
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,620
 Oh my gosh, someone's gonna murder.

487
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,180
 You could open up all the prisons and just say,

488
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,120
 hey, everybody out, 'cause we're all gonna be fine.

489
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,980
 Everyone's governed by the Spirit of God.

490
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,060
 Like, you don't have to lock your car.

491
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,660
 You don't have to lock anything anymore,

492
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,360
 because the world around you is governed

493
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,300
 by the Spirit of God, not the sinful nature.

494
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,220
 Even the reason that we have to lock everything,

495
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,960
 or there is prisons and all of that,

496
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,700
 it's a testimony to the fact that sin nature is real.

497
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,880
 It's behind this destruction in our own lives,

498
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,720
 the destruction in the world around us,

499
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,280
 and the Apostle Paul says there is a way

500
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,680
 to experience freedom from it,

501
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,840
 but it does not come from within you.

502
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,600
 It comes from the Spirit of God working inside of your life.

503
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,200
 And once he begins to work inside of life,

504
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,120
 it produces that fruit.

505
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,520
 And here's what I get so passionate about.

506
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,440
 This idea from this text,

507
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,920
 is like this is a not natural, a life governed by love,

508
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,920
 patience, joy, peace towards other people, kindness.

509
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,920
 Those are not natural things.

510
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,520
 The church of Jesus Christ, supernaturally, by the Spirit,

511
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,260
 brings to the world qualities

512
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,200
 that they will not find anywhere else.

513
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,360
 Like, we live in America, and we think,

514
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,440
 yeah, everyone thinks that kindness is a good idea.

515
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,280
 Newsflash, no, they don't.

516
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,260
 Go to countries where there isn't

517
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,840
 a Judeo-Christian value set up.

518
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,320
 Women, you don't have rights.

519
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,800
 You can't drive a car in Saudi Arabia.

520
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,000
 They're our biggest oil trading partner.

521
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,900
 Think about that.

522
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,760
 I mean, there's 100 million more men in Asia than women

523
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,360
 because of selective abortion, because you know why?

524
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,800
 They don't think like the Spirit of Christ

525
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,680
 that says, hey, look, every single person matters.

526
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,800
 They think men are more valuable than women.

527
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,380
 So selective abortion has killed 100 million less women.

528
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,260
 The values, the perspective, the love,

529
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,380
 the qualities introduced by the Spirit of God

530
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,660
 to the church are unique.

531
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,500
 You will not find them anywhere else.

532
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,740
 And Paul says, man, they are a necessity for life

533
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,900
 if you're gonna experience it.

534
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,800
 They're a necessity for the world

535
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,400
 if they're gonna experience life

536
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,740
 because it's only there that you're gonna find it.

537
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,020
 And it's not inside of yourself.

538
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,140
 It's not inside of myself.

539
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,420
 It comes from the Spirit of God at work in someone's life.

540
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,700
 And we're gonna get to how he works in someone's life

541
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,560
 or how we can experience that in a second,

542
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,380
 but more than anything, I hope to overestimate

543
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,980
 or the fact that I cannot overestimate the importance

544
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,620
 of what you as the body of Christ, which is a Christian,

545
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,100
 which is someone who has the Spirit of God

546
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,440
 leading them in life, what you bring to the world

547
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,260
 that does not exist anywhere else.

548
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,180
 I mean, think about the 58 million lives

549
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,660
 that have been lost in this country since 1973

550
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,900
 through O.V. Wade, through abortion,

551
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,820
 which did not take place because of those will not acts

552
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,360
 that were underneath the governing

553
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,520
 of the Holy Spirit of God.

554
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,960
 The Holy Spirit does not say, "Kill this child."

555
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,960
 Well, you and I, as the Church of Jesus Christ,

556
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,940
 when we say we are bringing what is necessary for life,

557
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,980
 it's the life or death,

558
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,800
 and it's the Church of Jesus Christ all over the world,

559
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,060
 all over the centuries behind us,

560
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,320
 that has over and over and over again stood up

561
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,680
 and said what no one else would say,

562
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,400
 what you can't say apart from the Spirit of God,

563
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,800
 which is, "Hey, look, hey, I have a dream.

564
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,820
 "Every, or one day, people will be known

565
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,880
 "not by the color of their skin,

566
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,900
 "but the content of their character.

567
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,960
 "I'm a pastor who has a worldview informed

568
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,920
 "by the Spirit of Christ that every person,

569
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,040
 "red, yellow, black, white,

570
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,420
 "they're all precious in his sight.

571
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,920
 "Men and women, they're all valuable."

572
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,400
 That's a Christian perspective.

573
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,600
 That is the Spirit of God speaking into someone's life.

574
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,460
 That is not a natural view.

575
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,920
 Nature and natural human thinking is racism.

576
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,800
 Slavery, that's natural.

577
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,040
 It's the Spirit of God that worked

578
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,600
 when William Wilberforce in Great Britain

579
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,920
 in the early 1800s said way ahead of the game,

580
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,440
 "We're gonna shut down the slave trade over here

581
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,820
 "because I'm a follower of Christ.

582
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,360
 "What I'm seeing is that every person,

583
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,680
 "based on what God's Word says,

584
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,120
 "based on what the Spirit of God says,

585
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,000
 "has value, dignity, and this is not acceptable anymore."

586
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,560
 Over and over and over again,

587
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,560
 the Spirit of God has drove and impacted legislation.

588
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,320
 People were able to endure incredible suffering

589
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,460
 because of the way that they said,

590
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,920
 "Hey, I'm gonna stand up for what's right here."

591
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,200
 And it's not natural.

592
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,560
 Man, if you are a part of the body of Christ,

593
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,200
 I could not, even if I tried,

594
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
 overestimate how important you are

595
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,800
 because you bring the supernatural work of the Spirit

596
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,600
 to a world that needs it, that will not have it,

597
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,120
 will not find it anywhere else.

598
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,440
 I read an article not long ago that we shared,

599
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,160
 I guess it was a while ago now,

600
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,760
 and in a series a few years ago at the porch,

601
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,540
 but it was by this atheist who was writing

602
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,880
 about the importance of Christianity in Africa.

603
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,100
 He's a guy named Matthew Paris,

604
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,400
 and he writes for the London Times,

605
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,700
 which is like the New York Times.

606
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,940
 He's basically a reporter for them,

607
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,900
 and he had spent time in Africa,

608
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,920
 and he basically wrote, and he was like,

609
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,900
 "Look, I'm an atheist,

610
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,680
 "but I can't deny how important Christianity,

611
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,100
 "we need more missionaries over here."

612
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,980
 And so I just wanna read it

613
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,580
 just 'cause it's such a powerful,

614
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,460
 what he says from an atheist who looks around and says,

615
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,260
 "We are not gonna make it without these guys."

616
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,640
 Here's what he says, in the London Times.

617
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,980
 "As an atheist, I truly believe Africa needs God.

618
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,720
 "This confounds my ideological beliefs,

619
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,920
 "stubbornly refuses to fit my worldview,

620
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,640
 "and has embarrassed my growing belief

621
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,480
 "that there is no God.

622
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,860
 "Though I'm an atheist,

623
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,780
 "I've become convinced of the enormous contribution

624
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,560
 "Christian evangelism makes in Africa,

625
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,180
 "sharply distinct from the work of secular NGOs

626
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,500
 "and government projects and international aid efforts.

627
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 "These alone will not do."

628
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,000
 Come on, dude, this'll preach.

629
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,760
 "Education and training will not do,"

630
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,460
 says this atheist reporter

631
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,440
 for one of the largest newspapers in the world.

632
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,940
 "In Africa, Christianity changes people's hearts."

633
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,260
 The change is good.

634
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,300
 "Christians, black and white,

635
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,640
 "working in Africa do heal the sick,

636
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,140
 "do teach people to read and write,

637
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,540
 "and only the severest kind of secularist or atheist

638
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,220
 "could see a mission hospital or a school

639
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,580
 "and say the world would be better

640
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,220
 "without that Christian school or hospital.

641
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,180
 "Missionaries, not aid money,

642
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,980
 "are the solution to Africa's biggest problem.

643
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,840
 "Removing Christian," hold on,

644
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,340
 "removing Christian evangelism from the planet,

645
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,240
 "from the African equation may leave the continent,"

646
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,140
 listen to this.

647
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,380
 Dude, this is so crazy, he's an atheist going,

648
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,420
 hey, look, guys, if we get these Christians out of here,

649
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,120
 hold on, don't let 'em leave yet.

650
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,280
 Here's what he says, the final words.

651
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,800
 "Removing Christian evangelism from the African equation

652
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,520
 "may leave the continent at the mercy

653
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,460
 "of a malign fusion of Nike, the witch doctor,

654
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,980
 "the mobile phone, and the machete."

655
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,920
 Matthew Paris, the London Times,

656
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,640
 that this atheist looks on and he says,

657
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,660
 look, let me tell you something,

658
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,340
 Christianity, there's something super,

659
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,980
 there's something, I don't even believe in God,

660
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,420
 but it changes people's hearts.

661
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,000
 It changes the way that they act,

662
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,200
 the way that they think.

663
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,860
 In this place, this continent needs it.

664
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,280
 The thing that he left out of that,

665
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,800
 as amazing as it is, is that this world needs it.

666
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,520
 Matthew needs it, whether he realizes it or not.

667
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,540
 Apart from the Spirit of God,

668
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,700
 we all drift towards self-destruction.

669
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,220
 We all drift towards pride, towards anxiety,

670
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,540
 towards anger, towards depression.

671
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,140
 That's why substance abuse is out of control,

672
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,460
 and the Apostle Paul says,

673
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,180
 that's 'cause you have the sin nature.

674
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,340
 That's where the problem is.

675
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,420
 There is a solution.

676
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,660
 It is the Spirit of God producing

677
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,160
 and working in someone's life.

678
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,900
 And as you read that, you go, man,

679
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,120
 well, how do I access that?

680
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,540
 How do I experience, if that's a necessary thing for life,

681
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,180
 not an accessory, how do I have the Spirit of God

682
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,200
 produce that in my life?

683
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,700
 Which is where Paul goes next.

684
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:40,560
 Those, verse 24, those who belong to Christ Jesus

685
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,940
 have crucified the sinful nature,

686
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,660
 or they've already said they put it to death.

687
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,940
 Whenever Jesus died on the cross,

688
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,060
 they were like, hey, I'm leaving the old life behind.

689
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,960
 That's dead.

690
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,700
 Along with his passions and desires.

691
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,760
 Since we live by the Spirit,

692
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,360
 let us keep in step with the Spirit.

693
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,760
 Now, this little word for keep in step,

694
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,220
 it literally is the word for walking dependent on,

695
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,500
 or step-by-step moving with someone,

696
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,360
 as if it was like a three-legged race,

697
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,060
 or someone walking on your shoes.

698
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,100
 It's a little word for like, hey,

699
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,180
 every move that they make,

700
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,420
 we're gonna keep stepping with it.

701
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,860
 The Apostle Paul just said,

702
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,960
 the way that you and I live the Christian life

703
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,100
 is not by trying to follow a bunch of rules,

704
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,720
 not by trying to produce fruit in our own life.

705
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,620
 You really gotta get that.

706
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,720
 It's not you, just hey, go try to be kind.

707
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,900
 You can't go try to be supernaturally kind

708
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,020
 any more than right now you could grow an orange on your arm.

709
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,980
 You get that, right?

710
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,400
 Like, it's like, hey, just grow an orange.

711
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,500
 You're like, well, I'm not an orange tree.

712
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,460
 Yeah, you can't grow supernatural because you're natural.

713
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,500
 And he says, the way that you and I

714
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,020
 access the supernatural in our life,

715
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,900
 the way that we experience the supernatural fruit

716
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,700
 growing inside of our life is by dependence,

717
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,700
 step by step by step dependence on the Spirit of God.

718
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,820
 That we walk with Him every moment,

719
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,700
 every day in ordinary moments,

720
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,420
 as we face temptation, as we face anxiety,

721
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,660
 whatever it is, God, I can't, but you can.

722
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,900
 Will you help me right now?

723
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,080
 I'm tempted right now because my boss, again,

724
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,400
 is doing that thing that all I feel is anger and rage,

725
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,420
 and I hate this place.

726
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,540
 And God, I can't, but you can.

727
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,620
 Will you help me to be faithful and loving?

728
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,580
 I'm totally dependent on you, God.

729
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,980
 Will you help me right now?

730
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,300
 That in moment by moment, we cry out to Him,

731
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,140
 call out to Him.

732
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,680
 One of the ways that that looks like is prayer.

733
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,300
 We say, God, will you help me right now?

734
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,180
 I'm overwhelmed, I'm anxious.

735
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,540
 I know you don't want me to feel anxious.

736
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,160
 That's a sin.

737
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,260
 Will you help me, Lord?

738
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,380
 I know you love me.

739
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,220
 You're in control.

740
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,280
 Will you help me?

741
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,760
 Keeping in step with the Spirit

742
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,700
 also involves other people around you,

743
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,880
 which is where Paul goes next.

744
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,220
 We don't have time to cover it tonight.

745
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,300
 In Galatians, where he says,

746
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,980
 bear one another's burdens.

747
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,180
 You do this together.

748
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,720
 When you find yourself in that temptation

749
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,980
 where you're dating that girl,

750
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,980
 and all of a sudden, it's like,

751
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,100
 oh, man, this is, hey, how you doing?

752
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,620
 And you're all of a sudden under the temptation

753
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,700
 of taking things farther

754
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,860
 than God's word says you should sexually.

755
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,500
 You say, God, I can't, but you can.

756
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,480
 Will you help me?

757
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,980
 I'm gonna loop other believers in.

758
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,580
 Hold us accountable to help me, Lord.

759
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,300
 I'm tempted to go back to the bar scene.

760
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
 I'm tempted to go back where it is.

761
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,220
 God, I can't, but you can.

762
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,260
 Will you help me now?

763
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,820
 I'm moment by moment walking in dependence on you.

764
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,740
 That's what Paul says is the Christian life.

765
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,940
 That's how we'll always be lived.

766
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,300
 It's not just like, hey, here's a list.

767
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,920
 Follow these rules.

768
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,580
 It is follow this person.

769
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,720
 Step by step, dependence on God.

770
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,560
 It's like my son.

771
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,700
 My son is 13 months old right now,

772
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,780
 so he's learning to walk,

773
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,580
 so he's in this phase where he's like,

774
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,580
 he just leans on stuff when he's trying to walk,

775
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,020
 so it's like Spider-Man up against the wall,

776
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,260
 touching things at all times.

777
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,940
 And he's recently taken ground where he'll like,

778
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,220
 he can walk with us holding his hands.

779
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,060
 Like, he'll take steps,

780
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,100
 and he'll like put both of his hands in our hands,

781
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
 and he'll walk and take steps with them.

782
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,060
 He didn't always love it, but hey,

783
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,460
 sometimes you gotta play hurt, buddy.

784
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,780
 So we're learning how to walk,

785
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,820
 and he's walking dependent on his father,

786
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,880
 dependent on his mother.

787
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,460
 Step by step by step.

788
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,160
 This is how the Christian life is lived.

789
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,420
 Unlike in that scenario where like eventually,

790
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,500
 he's hopefully gonna walk without me like holding his hands

791
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,340
 where it's like, hey, buddy, we're going to prom.

792
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,640
 Let me hold your hands.

793
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,020
 He's gonna learn, hey, I don't have to be dependent.

794
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,120
 The Christian life from beginning to end

795
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,020
 is I'm totally dependent on you, God.

796
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,860
 Will you help me?

797
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,340
 That's how you get saved, right?

798
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,900
 The way you become a believer is not by going like,

799
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,820
 hey, God, I've attended church, I'm gonna commute.

800
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,180
 It's like I'm totally dependent on you

801
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,140
 if I'm gonna get in, God.

802
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,380
 I'm not a good enough person.

803
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,540
 I'm a broken person.

804
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,700
 I need a savior, not a second chance.

805
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,780
 Will you help me?

806
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,480
 Paul says that is the same way

807
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,700
 that you live the Christian life.

808
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,900
 The way you get in is the way you finish.

809
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,620
 Moment by moment, dependence.

810
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,920
 You wanna bring about the fruit of the spirit in your life.

811
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,580
 It won't happen by you just trying harder.

812
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,100
 You can try to be kind,

813
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,000
 and I'm gonna really be patient today,

814
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,700
 but to want to be patient or to want to be kind,

815
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,360
 it's just overflowing out of you.

816
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,160
 It doesn't come from within you.

817
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,140
 It doesn't come from within me.

818
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,560
 It comes from dependence on the spirit of God,

819
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,040
 and when people throw their hands up and say,

820
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,000
 I surrender, I'm dependent on you,

821
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,160
 I'm gonna keep in step with the spirit,

822
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,400
 which is our third point.

823
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,740
 Their life begins to change.

824
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,360
 Moment by moment, ordinary moments.

825
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,200
 You know what?

826
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,360
 Even what's going on across this city,

827
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,200
 in El Paso and in Fort Worth and in Tulsa

828
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,960
 and in Houston and in the woodlands and in spring

829
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,440
 and really all over the place

830
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,640
 where people of God are gathered in different churches

831
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,280
 in different places where people are pursuing Jesus,

832
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,700
 walking in dependence on him.

833
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,040
 You know what's beginning to take place?

834
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,760
 An everyday, think about this,

835
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,520
 in everyday ordinary moments,

836
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,240
 moments that don't even look spectacular,

837
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,840
 people are walking in dependence on God.

838
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,040
 They're dating differently than the world around you.

839
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,520
 They're revolutionary in their dating.

840
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,920
 They're saying, I'm gonna honor how this girl,

841
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,600
 I'm gonna honor the way that I think about her,

842
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,760
 the way that I talk to her,

843
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,640
 the boundaries that I set with her.

844
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,840
 Young adults are walking in dependence

845
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,080
 as it relates to their job and they're saying,

846
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,940
 I'm not gonna live for the American dream,

847
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,200
 it's too small of a thing to give my life to.

848
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,320
 I'm gonna pursue something bigger,

849
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,120
 which is living for Christ right here, right in this moment,

850
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
 and everyday ordinary moments.

851
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,120
 They're revolutionary in their dependence on him.

852
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,480
 And all that that looks like inside of that moment

853
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,320
 is nothing special.

854
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,400
 I'm anxious, will you help me to trust in you?

855
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,600
 That's revolutionary.

856
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,880
 While the rest of the world goes, hey, take these meds.

857
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,540
 Take this drink, do something.

858
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,400
 And they're revolutionary young adults,

859
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,000
 people of all ages,

860
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,440
 followers of Christ by the Spirit of God,

861
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,920
 producing fruit of them who are saying,

862
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
 I'm gonna walk in dependence on you, God.

863
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,440
 You're gonna define the way that I date.

864
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,960
 You're gonna define the woman that I marry.

865
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,360
 You're gonna find the man that I marry.

866
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,720
 You're gonna find the way that I raise kids.

867
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,040
 You are gonna define my life.

868
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,400
 You are not a component or an accessory of life.

869
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,600
 You are life.

870
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:10,440
 If you ever find that life,

871
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,120
 if you ever experienced that life,

872
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,440
 the degree to which you and I experience that life

873
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,960
 will be the degree to which we walk in dependence on him.

874
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,380
 He's not an accessory for life.

875
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,040
 Christ, the Spirit of God working in your life

876
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:30,420
 is a necessity for life, not an accessory.

877
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,260
 Let me pray that you know that, God.

878
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,220
 Father, we thank you that you are working

879
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,700
 in the lives of young adults all over this town.

880
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,260
 Thank you that you have worked in our lives,

881
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,580
 that you're continuing in your grace and kindness.

882
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
 You're patient with us, Lord,

883
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,100
 because that's what the Spirit of God is.

884
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,460
 He's so patient, Lord.

885
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,800
 And that you provide strength where we're weak,

886
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,660
 you are strong.

887
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,540
 You don't require us to do something,

888
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,340
 to reach deep down, like Shane said,

889
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,420
 to our bootstraps and pull ourselves up and try harder.

890
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,900
 You require us to just depend on you, to walk with you.

891
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,440
 We're not strong enough in and of ourself.

892
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,740
 We declare that and confess that to you, Lord.

893
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,740
 We need your help.

894
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,000
 We need you every moment.

895
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,320
 You're worthy of all of our life,

896
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,220
 of all of our worship.

897
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,340
 Will you help us to honor you

898
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,940
 in everything that we do, Lord?

899
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,320
 May we keep in step by step with you.

900
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,240
 You're worthy of all of it.

901
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,280
 And we just declare that and by faith,

902
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,540
 ask for you to help us continue to walk that out.

903
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,220
 We worship you now in song, amen.

904
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:47,220
